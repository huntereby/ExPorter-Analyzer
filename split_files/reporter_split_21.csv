Our program aims to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system regulating our sleep
quality/efficiency and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological diseases (and probably many
others) for all people. Quality sleep is a fundamental necessity for maintaining health and critical for optimal
cognitive functioning. Although we have known this for a long time, we have little understanding of how the
quality and quantity of sleep are regulated. We began to study individuals with the familial natural short sleep
trait more than a decade ago and have now identified a growing list of genes/mutations carried by these
individuals. While they are genetically wired to sleep fewer hours per day, they do not desire more sleep and do
not seem to suffer the consequences of sleep deficiency and usually live a long and healthy life (both physically
and mentally), indicating that they sleep more efficiently. Identifying genetic differences in this population
provides solid evidence for the involvement of specific molecules and pathways in regulating sleep
quality/efficiency pathways. These molecules offer opportunities to not only reveal the molecular mechanisms
but also map brain regions and cells responsible for sleep regulation, thus gaining an understanding of the
systems involved in sleep quality/efficiency regulation. We have used our short sleep mouse models and
Alzheimer-like disease mouse models to demonstrate that these short sleep mutations offer protective effects
against the development and the progression of AD-like pathology. This finding has the revolutionary implication
that quality sleep can help prevent many diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. My research aims to
understand how sleep quality is regulated and thus know how quality sleep can be obtained. The results from
this research program will have long-lasting beneficial effects on human healthy longevity."

Recent advances in adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT), especially CD19-targeting chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy (CD19CART), have highlighted the potential of immunotherapy to
achieve durable and curative patient outcomes. However, even for the well-developed
CD19CART, many patients have failed to respond to the treatment or succumbed to late relapse.
Moreover, so far ACT in general has not been effective in treating most solid tumors. The major
barriers to effective ACT include deficiencies in donor T cell expansion, persistence and tumor-
infiltration, as well as loss of T-cell effector function - a process termed exhaustion. There is
increasing demand for novel strategies that can overcome these barriers to improve the efficacy
of ACT. The presence of CD4 T cells with a polyfunctional phenotype, characterized by
concomitant production of multiple inflammatory cytokines, has been associated with favorable
therapeutic outcomes in preclinical models and cancer patients. However, how to generate
polyfunctional CD4 (pfCD4) T cells suitable for ACT remains elusive. We previously reported that
CD4 T cells exposed to interleukin 7 (IL7) during antigenic stimulation can acquire
polyfunctionality in a STAT5-dependent manner. Our recent work demonstrated that ectopic
expression of a constitutively active form of STAT5 (CASTAT5) in CD4 T cells induces genome-
wide transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling in tumor-specific CD4 T cells, endowing these
cells polyfunctionality, exhaustion-resistance and tumor-infiltrating capability. Importantly,
CASTAT5 can markedly improve the expansion and persistence of CD19CAR T cells, resulting
in high cure rate in mice with advanced lymphoma. These new findings form the basis of our
central hypothesis that CASTAT5-induced epigenetic remodeling endows CD4 T cells
polyfunctionality and exhaustion-resistance, and these features equip CD4 T cells with superior
helper activities to orchestrate potent antitumor immune responses. This cross-disciplinary multi-
PI project will employ our well-characterized ACT model systems in conjunction with cutting-edge
epigenomics and single cell RNA sequencing technologies to advance our understanding of the
ontogeny, heterogeneity, regulatory circuitry and mechanism of action of pfCD4 T cells.
Specifically, we will investigate how persistent STAT5 signaling induces and maintains pfCD4 T
cells (Aim 1), how CASTAT5-induced pfCD4 T cells potentiate ACT (Aim 2), and the potential
utility of CASTAT5 in human CD19CAR T cells (Aim 3). Successful completion of this project will
establish CASTAT5 as a clinically applicable strategy to overcome the barriers impeding effective
ACT including CAR T cell therapy."

Noise trauma can lead to loss of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons in the auditory cortex, which is
associated with audiotory processing deficit and tinnitus in rodent models. The mechanisms underlying noise-
induced PV neuron loss are unknown. We propose to examine the hypothesis that differential activation of
TNFR1 and TNFR2 in cortical PV neurons determines the fate of the PV neurons following noise trauma, with
TNFR1 biasing for, and TNFR2 biasing against, neuronal loss and dysfunction.
Specific Aim 1. Determine the effects of TNFR1 or TNFR2 knockdown on noise-induced PV neuron loss.
PV-Cre-tdTomato mice will be injected with one of three viral vectors (with TNFR1 shRNA, TNFR2 shRNA or
scrambled sequences as a control) in the auditory cortex, and exposed or sham-exposed to noise trauma. PV
neurons will be visualized by the Cre reporter tdTomato in auditory cortical sections. Transfected neurons will
be visualized with the viral reporter GFP. Our hypothesis predicts that noise-induced PV neuron loss will be
reduced by TNFR1 knockdown, but enhanced by TNFR2 knockdown for the transfected PV neurons. Cell loss
should not be altered for the populations of un-transfected PV neurons, and PV neurons transfected with the
scrambled sequences.
Specific Aim 2. Examine the effects of TNFR1 or TNFR2 knockdown on noise-induced dysfunction of PV
neuron synapses. Our pilot data indicate that noise trauma leads to a reduced transmitter release probability
at the output synapses of the PV neurons, and accelerated neurotransmitter depletion. We hypothesize that this
synaptic dysfunction depends on the activation of TNFR1 in the surviving PV neurons, and knockdown of TNFR1
will prevent the synaptic deficits. In addition, knockdown of TNFR2 should exacerbate PV neuron dysfunction.
PV-Cre-ChR2-tdTomato mice will be injected with one of the three viral vectors in the auditory cortex, and be
exposed or sham-exposed to noise trauma. We will record optically activated inhibitory synaptic current in
Layer2/3 pyramidal neurons in acute auditory cortical slices. Synaptic input-output curve, paired-pulse
modulation and depletion will be examined. Afterward, the slices will be fixed and imaged to quantify PV neuron
loss and viral transfection rate in the surviving PV neurons, which will then be correlated with PV neuron synaptic
dysfunction.We hypothesize that noise exposure disrupts cortical PV neuron function, and PV neuron
dysfunction is a cause of gap detection deficit. We propose to use a mouse model to test this central hypothesis
in the follwing specific aims."

Dr. Hiroki Nariai is a pediatric epileptologist/clinical neurophysiologist whose long-term goal is to be a leading
physician-scientist in pediatric epilepsy, using key biomarkers to effectively treat children with epilepsy and
reduce their mortality and morbidity. In this project, Dr. Nariai proposes to study medication-resistant focal
epilepsy in children by integrating computational electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, deep learning, and
advanced statistics to investigate and validate high-frequency oscillations (HFOs)—a promising spatial
biomarker of the epileptic brain. More than one-third of children with epilepsy are resistant to medications and
are therefore potential candidates for epilepsy surgery. To achieve postoperative seizure freedom, one must
remove or disrupt the epileptogenic zone (EZ), defined as the brain area that is indispensable for generating
seizures, while preserving the eloquent cortex (EC), defined as the brain area that controls essential functions.
Thus, identifying biomarkers that accurately localize and discriminate EZ from EC will be groundbreaking. HFOs
are recorded via intracranial EEG as short bursts of high-frequency neuronal activity and are often observed in
EZ. However, the major challenge is that physiological HFOs generated by healthy brain tissue complicate the
clinical interpretation of HFOs. Therefore, there is a critical need to distinguish between pathological and
physiological HFOs. Dr. Nariai hypothesizes that deep learning-based algorithms can distinguish pathological
and physiological HFOs based on subtle morphological features linked to specific biological mechanisms.
Through this K23 career development award, Dr. Nariai proposes to accomplish the following training goals: (1)
acquire skills in an advanced computational EEG analysis to enable customized quantification of HFOs in a large
dataset, (2) gain knowledge of the theory of deep learning and skills in its application in EEG signal processing
to enable morphological assessment of HFOs, and (3) develop proficiency in advanced statistics in clinical
research to validate prediction models and gain knowledge in clinical trials. Under the joint mentorship of leading
researchers led by Dr. Jerome Engel, Jr., at UCLA, Dr. Nariai will build deep learning-based models in a large
retrospective cohort to define HFOs expressed in EZ (eHFOs) to represent pathological HFOs. In addition, HFOs
expressed in EC (ecHFOs) will be defined to represent physiological HFOs. The trained classifier will be analyzed
to obtain the computational definition of eHFOs and ecHFOs. Along with demonstrating that real-time HFO
analysis is feasible in a prospective cohort, eHFOs and ecHFOs will be analyzed to prove that HFOs can localize
and discriminate EZ from EC. Dr. Nariai has shown preliminary results supporting the feasibility of his proposed
approach. Completing the proposed goals will provide significant progress toward utilizing HFOs as a clinically
useful spatial biomarker of the epileptic brain to guide epilepsy surgery, which Dr. Nariai plans to pursue as an
R01 project."

The proposed U19, referred to as the CASEPR program, aims to develop robust, durable disease-modifying
CRISPR-mediated genomic gene-editing therapies for the neurodegenerative disorders of Huntington’s disease
(HD) and C9orf72-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9-ALS). These investigations will require preclinical
in vivo studies of drug delivery and efficacy. The mission of ‘Resource Core II: In Vivo Core’ is to carry out
all of the in vivo non-GLP small animal studies for the research programs supported by this U19. The In
Vivo Core will provide essential services necessary to carry out all three research projects in the CASEPR
program through the following aims: In Aim 1 the In Vivo Resource Core will perform all of the non-GLP in vivo
administration of gene-editing vectors for all CASPER program research projects to achieve optimal dosing and
distribution of the CRISPR vectors using convection-enhanced delivery neurosurgical techniques. In Aim 2 we
will conduct standardized phenotypic assays in mouse models of disease to assess the efficacy of gene editing
on rescue of disease-related behavior. Finally, in Aim 3 In Vivo Core researchers will be responsible for procuring
relevant tissues from experimental animals and shipping of materials to the other resource cores, the Genomics
Core and the Biological Outcomes Core, as appropriate. Centralizing the in vivo non-GLP small animal work will
ensure uniformity in both neurosurgical studies and behavioral assessments across all projects. Research output
from the In Vivo Core will provide essential data on investigational drug targeting, distribution, editing efficacy,
and behavioral impact. The services provided by the In Vivo Core will accelerate the timeline from preclinical
animal studies to IND by consolidation of resources and expertise."

Detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia (DSD) is a major urological problem inducing inefficient voiding, increased
amount of post-void residual urine and high intravesical pressure after spinal cord injury (SCI). Until recently the
majority of studies on spinal mechanisms of coordination between external urethral sphincter (EUS) and the
bladder (BL) were conducted in female rats, although in clinical practice DSD develops more often in males.
Furthermore, sexual dimorphism in anatomy and function of the lower urinary tract (LUT) suggests differences
in the spinal neural circuits of male and female. With development of genetic modifications and optogenetic
techniques the mouse model of LUT dysfunction is becoming more useful than the rat. Therefore, in the
proposed project “Intraspinal circuits supporting synergy between the bladder and urethral sphincter in
mice” we will use transgenic mice of both sexes for electrophysiological, optogenetic, immunohistochemical,
pharmacological and anatomical studies of spinal cord circuits involved in interaction between the bladder (BL)
and the external urethral sphincter (EUS) in spinal intact animals and after spinal cord injury.
 We will test several hypotheses in in vivo and in vitro experiments. In urethane anesthetized animals of
both sexes, we will determine functional differences in spinal regulation of micturition and in control and SCI
mice. Male and female animals will be also used to determine hypothesized sexual dimorphism in LUT-related
spinal circuits and their plasticity after chronic SCI. Using electrical stimulation of the Lumbar Spinal Coordinating
Center (LSCC) which we have recently discovered in L3/L4 spinal segments, we will test whether an external
command can initiate voiding. Using trans-synaptic viral labeling, we will trace neuronal populations involved in
coordination between EUS and BL to determine structural and functional differences in LUT spinal networks
between males and females. In spinal cord slice preparations, we will use transgenic mice expressing channel
rhodopsin (ChR2) in inhibitory or excitatory neurons to study reactions of EUS motoneurons to light-evoked
activity of LUT-related spinal interneurons embedded in specific spinal pathways, and will identify and
characterize the inhibitory circuit which is responsible for EUS relaxation. We will define the role of the L3/L4
LSCC in activity of EUS motoneurons and EUS relaxation and its mode of interaction with L6/S1 motor neuronal
pool. We will evaluate the contribution of a hypothesized recurrent inhibitory circuit in L6/S1 to the generation of
EUS bursting and relaxation as well as to bladder-sphincter coordination.
 The long-term objectives of the research project are to increase our understanding of the
pathophysiological mechanisms inducing DSD and voiding problems after SCI and to develop new and effective
therapeutic interventions for the treatment of DSD in spinal cord disorders. Considering gender related
differences in neural control of the LUT different approaches to DSD treatment in males and females may be
recommended."

Lyme borreliosis, also known as Lyme disease, remains a prevalent tick-borne infection in many parts of the
world. In the United States alone, there are over 300,000 new cases occurring each year. The infection is
caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which is a group of atypical extracellular bacterial pathogens that
survive in nature through a complex enzootic infection cycle, involving ticks belonging to the Ixodes scapularis
complex and an array of vertebrate hosts, most commonly wild rodents. Despite serious efforts to control the
infection over the past several decades, the infection persists, largely due to the absence of effective control
measures against tick infestation, lack of human vaccines, difficulties in diagnosis of early infection, and clinical
complications associated with treatment using currently-available antimicrobials. Specifically, several months
after standard-care antibiotic therapy, a subset of patients can experience a series of persistent or relapsing
symptoms, known as chronic Lyme disease or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, for which further
treatment options remain unavailable. Therefore, the development of vaccines and new drugs is highly
warranted to combat Lyme disease. This project pursues a long-term goal to understand the biological
significance of a critical set of microbial virulence determinants and gain knowledge necessary for the
development of new therapeutic strategies to intervene with Lyme borreliosis. The emphasis is on protein-
protein interactions essential for pathogen infection and persistence in the host, and the goal is to provide
comprehensive structural and functional information that defines the biological significance of three spirochete
proteins annotated as BB0323, BB0238, and BB0104 (BbHtrA), each of which either independently or as a
complex are essential for infection. The previous project cycle demonstrated that the targeted deletion or
alteration of either protein partners or short binding epitopes impact protein stability and render the pathogen
non-infectious in a mammalian host. The overall objective of the current proposal is to further focus on
BB0323 and associated proteins in order to: 1) define the specific events of protein maturation, 2)
determine protein-protein interactions, and 3) contribute to the determination of their structures to
better understand their roles in dictating spirochete infection in mammals and transmission from ticks.
These studies will enlighten our fundamental knowledge of the atypical biology of spirochetes and will facilitate
the design of non-traditional anti-infective strategies to combat Lyme borreliosis, including the development of
vaccines, small molecule drugs, and biologics."

Outdoor air pollution is a known cause of childhood asthma exacerbations yet is rarely addressed in routine
asthma care. This gap between scientific knowledge and clinical practice must be addressed to improve
healthcare for children with asthma. While there is no ‘safe’ level of pollution, personal susceptibility to both air
pollution and asthma exacerbations varies in children. Childhood asthma exacerbations are difficult to predict,
lead to missed school and parental work days, and contribute substantially to healthcare utilization and costs. It
is unclear if our current asthma therapies protect against pollution-induced exacerbations. Pollution reduction
policies are the best intervention, yet until such time as ‘clean’ air is guaranteed for all, developing biomarkers
identifying children at greatest risk of pollution-induced exacerbations are needed to develop interventions.
The airway epithelium is an ideal tissue to study omics and develop new biomarkers of pollution-induced
asthma exacerbations, as susceptibility genes for asthma are expressed in airway epithelium and pollutants
(e.g. particulate matter <2.5𝜇m (PM2.5)) induce epigenetic and gene expression changes. Little is known about
the effects of chronic pollution exposure on DNA methylation and gene expression in children with asthma, or
whether such changes are associated with asthma exacerbations. Further, it is unknown if pollution avoidance
recommendations (the Air Quality Index (AQI)) results in differential DNA methylation or gene expression. This
proposal will: 1) determine the association between exposure to PM2.5 and residential proximity to a major road
(a proxy for traffic-related air pollution) and (a) genome-wide DNA methylation and (b) gene expression in
nasal (airway) epithelium from children with asthma; 2) identify differentially DNA methylated markers or
expressed genes (by exposure level to PM2.5 or roadway) that are associated with asthma exacerbations; and
3) conduct an exploratory analysis to estimate the effects of the Environmental Protection Agency-sponsored
AQI behavioral intervention on DNA methylation and gene expression from a trial of children with asthma. Aims
1- 2 uses existing data from two completed NIH-funded studies. Aim 3 uses banked biospecimens from a pilot
randomized clinical trial of children receiving the AQI intervention on asthma action plans (i.e. clinical care).
This proposal addresses an unmet need, namely developing ‘omic’ markers of pollutant-induced asthma
exacerbations in children. Dr. Rosser’s career development plan provides for mastery of statistical genomic
methods and analyses, and builds upon clinical trial management and analysis skills. She is well positioned for
her proposed research given epidemiology background, skills with spatial modeling, and pilot data. This career
development award will provide the skills and preliminary data for an R01 seeking to test whether
epigenetic/gene markers predict risk of asthma outcomes and response to the AQI intervention."

Prediabetes and obesity are major public health issues that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and
low-income individuals in the United States (US). Approximately 84 million American adults have prediabetes.
The recent increased prevalence of prediabetes is caused largely by the global epidemic of obesity. In the U.S,
the prevalence of obesity was recently reported at about 40% adults. With the growing prevalence of obesity in
the U.S., prediabetes is expected to become an even greater public health challenge. The Diabetes Prevention
Program trial and other large trials have shown that a moderate amount of weight loss achieved by reducing
total caloric intake and increasing physical activity can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
However, these prevention programs involving in-person counseling can be expensive to implement and
sustain in clinical or community settings over extended periods of time. The rapid rise of sophisticated
digital devices (i.e., mobile applications, wireless activity trackers, social network) provides an opportunity
to transform the way health care team deliver a diabetes prevention and weight loss program. These digital
technologies are inexpensive and widely available and can reach large numbers of adults with prediabetes and
obesity. However, despite their popularity and availability, the vast majority of individuals will stop using them
within weeks because of lack of systematic behavior change approach (i.e. setting personalized short-term and
long-term goals).Therefore, an urgent need exists in successfully incorporating these inexpensive digital devices
into a diabetes prevention and weight loss program and sustain its effect over time. The goal of this project is to
assess the effect and sustainability of a digitally-based diabetes prevention program in English or Spanish
speaking adults with prediabetes and obesity. The primary outcomes are change in percent body weight and
HbA1c from baseline, 5, and 12 months. In this proposed 12-month randomized controlled trial, we will randomize
255 participants into one of 3 groups with a 1:1:1 ratio: 1) a Control (usual care), 2) a Regular intervention group,
and 3) a Plus group. While both the Regular and Plus group will receive a 5-month diabetes prevention
intervention in an identical fashion, only the Plus group will receive a 7-month maintenance intervention. The
Control group will receive an American Diabetes Association lifestyle brochure and wear an activity tracker, but
no intervention will be provided. Our research team seeks to shift the current paradigm, by moving to the use of
commonly used digital technology for diabetes prevention and weight loss programs, and test its sustainability.
We believe that the findings from this RCT will provide new insights into how to design interventions as well as
other lifestyle interventions."

ILC3s, gdT17 and Th17 cells share common features, e.g., expressing the master transcription factor RORgt
and the effector cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-22, and perform distinct immune functions under different
environment context. Our preliminary data suggest that RORgt+ cell-intrinsic deletion of Tfam in Tfamfl/flRorc-
cre mice affected RORgt+ gdT17 cells and ILC3s in vivo maintenance and led to small intestinal tissue
remodeling via a tuft cell–ILC2 circuit. An emerging concept of mitochondrial control of immunity beyond ATP
generation has recently been proposed. Based on the premise and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that
that Tfam-mediated mitochondrial respiration in gdT17 cells and ILC3s is pivotal for gdT17/ILC3 cell
homeostasis and regulation of small intestine tissue remodeling/metabolic changes and
immunity/inflammation. Specifically, we will investigate 1) the role of Tfam in gdT17 and ILC3 lymphocyte
maintenance, 2) the role of Tfam in gdT17 cells and/or ILC3s in regulating tuft cell-ILC2 circuit and small
intestine tissue remodeling, and 3) the role of Tfam in gdT17 cells and/or ILC3s in regulation of microbiome and
small intestinal immunity and inflammation. These experiments will offer an opportunity to elucidate Tfam-
mediated mitochondrial respiration in RORgt+ lymphocytes in the small intestine under the steady state and
during infection/immunity. Our study will provide novel cellular and molecular insights into the maintenance and
function of gdT17 cells and ILC3s regulated by Tfam. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the
requirement of Tfam for RORgt+ cells in regulation of small intestine tissue remodeling and immunity may
represent a new paradigm for human disease treatment and/or prevention."

High-quality evidence about clinically relevant genes and variants is a fundamental cornerstone of genomic
medicine. All aspects of clinical care derive from accurate information about the etiology, natural history, and
management of disease. With genomic analysis becoming more routine for patient care, the public availability
of well-curated and expertly adjudicated knowledge about genes and variants is critical. The ClinGen Resource
represents a highly collaborative effort of the genetics community to establish an evidence-based resource for
the assessment of the clinical relevance of genes and variants that is readily accessible to (and trusted by)
diagnostic laboratories, providers, and patients. Our objective is to improve patient care through enhanced and
accelerated curation of the clinical genome using innovative approaches to overcome challenges and address
new topics. We will accomplish this objective through the concerted pursuit of the following aims: aggregation
of structured evidence regarding genetic conditions and the genes and variants that cause them; application of
frameworks for expert curation of clinical validity, variant pathogenicity, and clinical actionability of genetic
conditions; broad dissemination of tools, standards, knowledge bases, and assertions about clinically relevant
genes and variants; and evaluation of all aspects of this work, so that we can improve the quality and impact of
the resource for implementation of transparent, reproducible, and evidence-based genomic medicine. The
proposal is innovative in several ways. It will aggregate data produced by cutting edge technologies, adapt
annotation tools to enable crowdsourcing through community curation, and apply advanced natural language
processing for annotation so that human curators can function at the top of their skill level. It will leverage the
participation of a large and enthusiastic community of volunteers, thus acting as a force multiplier for the NIH
funded teams. It will engage advocates who can conduct outreach within their areas of specialty, to further
extend the reach of ClinGen products into genomic medicine research and clinical care. It will transform a wide
range of clinical and basic science data into well-structured, transparently referenced expert assertions with
documentation of provenance and attention to ensuring the interoperability of the resource with diverse end-
users, including electronic health records. The proposed resource project is significant because in its entirety it
will improve, scale, and disseminate the freely available expert curation and interpretation of the human
genome to the global genomics community with the goal of improving health care for all people."
10868609,"Abstract Glial progenitor cells (GPCs) pervade the adult human brain, and can give rise to new oligodendrocytes
and astrocytes in response to myelin loss; yet they may fail to do so in chronic neuroinflammatory and age-
related white matter diseases. Our goal is to identify the transcriptional and epigenetic basis for age-related glial
progenitor failure, with the goal of identifying the repressive transcription factors and epigenetic states that restrict
progenitor cell expansion and differentiation with age. By targeting these repressive networks, we hope to restore
the functional viability of human GPCs, and by so doing prevent the myelin loss that characterizes both aging
and those neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders associated with white matter disease. By so doing, we
hope to preserve not only the differentiation competence of the cells, but also their self-renewal, so that myelin-
ogenesis may be induced from hGPCs without the progenitor depletion to be expected of strategies designed to
trigger terminal oligodendrocytic differentiation. Achieving this in human GPCs, which differ substantially in their
biology from mouse, and doing so in vivo, has proven a significant challenge to the field. To this end, we will ask:
 1. To what extent is the aging of human ESC-derived GPCs cell-intrinsic and linked to prior cell division,
both in vitro and in vivo? What are the transcriptional and epigenetic concomitants to hGPC aging in vivo, and
which of these restrict hGPC expansion and differentiation? How do hGPCs, extracted back from neonatally-
transplanted human chimeric mouse brains, change in their DNA methylation patterns, their ATAC-Seq-defined
patterns of chromatin accessibility, and their consequent RNA expression, over the 2-year lifespan of a mouse?
 2. To what extent are the effects of aging on hGPCs a function of the aged brain environment, rather than
cell autonomous? In order to define the relationship of hGPC cell age to expansion and myelination competence
- and the extent to which the age of the host influences hGPC fate – these experiments will include a set of
reciprocal, heterochronic transplants, grafting aged cells into neonates, and new hGPCs into aged brains.
 3. In aged GPCs, can genetic knock-down of those repressors implicated in the progression to adult
hGPC phenotype restore the transcriptional signature, as well as the expansion and differentiation competence
in vivo, of younger hGPCs? Is suppression of MAX, potentially together with a core set of other over-expressed
repressors, sufficient to restore MYC-dependent mitotic expansion and host colonization by aged hGPCs?
With this work, we expect to establish a granular understanding of the relative roles of cell-intrinsic, expansion-
dependent senescence and host context in regulating the proliferation and remyelination competence of human
GPCs. Furthermore, if the introduction of young hGPCs into an aged environment allows the selective
colonization of the host white matter by those younger hGPCs, the implications may be profound, as disorders
as varied as progressive multiple sclerosis and the neurodegenerative disorders might then become potential
targets of cell replacement strategies based on the competitive advantages of young over aged glial progenitors."
10878806,"Project Summary/Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) and related disorders are
the second most common neurodegenerative illness affecting over 1.5 million Americans and are the 14th leading
cause of death in the United States. Notably, while PD is traditionally described by motor symptoms (e.g. tremor),
more recent research demonstrates that nonmotor symptoms such as pain, depression, and dementia are
leading causes of mortality, quality of life (QOL), nursing home placement and caregiver distress. Regarding
models of care for PD and LBD, evidence suggests that care including a neurologist results in lower mortality
and nursing home placement than care solely from a primary care physician. Unfortunately, there is also
significant evidence that many of the needs most important to patients and family (e.g. pain, planning for the
future) are poorly addressed under current care models. Palliative care is an approach to caring for individuals
with serious illness that addresses multiple causes of suffering including medical symptoms, psychosocial issues
and spiritual needs. While developed for cancer patients, palliative care approaches have been successfully
applied in other chronic progressive illnesses. There is expanding interest in applying these principles to PD and
LBD. A small but growing cadre of centers now offer outpatient palliative care for PD and LBD with mounting
evidence of efficacy including a randomized trial of academic-based outpatient palliative care led by the PI. While
this work is critical to forwarding this field, further work is needed to provide models that can be widely
disseminated in the community where the majority of patients receive their care. The current proposal addresses
this gap and builds on lessons learned our original R01 grant by assessing the effectiveness and feasibility of a
novel community-based intervention that builds online learning communities around palliative care for community
neurology practices and augments care for patients and family around social support communities. We
hypothesize this intervention will improve patient QOL, caregiver burden and community provider career
satisfaction. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the a) effectiveness and b) feasibility of a novel community-
based outpatient palliative care model for PD and LBD; 2) Describe the effects of this model on patient and
caregiver costs and healthcare utilization; and 3) Identify opportunities to optimize this model by: a) describing
patient and caregiver characteristics associated with intervention benefits; and b) through direct patient,
caregiver and provider interviews. Innovations of our approach include the use of online learning communities
to implement primary palliative care with neurologists and the use of online networks to provide team-based
support and peer connections to patients and families. The research is significant because it tests a potentially
more efficient and effective model of providing palliative care to persons affected by PD and LBD, and, in
conjunction with other work conducted by our group, will provide data relevant to patients, healthcare providers,
policy makers and other stakeholders to guide future dissemination efforts in this field."
10868736,"Project Summary
 Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit multiple differences in sensory perception, which have now
been recognized as a core feature of the condition. Among these sensory differences, decreased sound tolerance (DST;
i.e., an inability to cope with everyday sounds) is particularly salient, with a lifetime prevalence of 50–70% in the ASD
population. Despite both first-person accounts and empirical studies indicating that DST is a major source of distress and
functional impairment in ASD, little is known about the phenomenology or physiologic underpinnings of this symptom
cluster, and no evidence-based treatments for DST in ASD are currently available. Some researchers have suggested that
the adverse reactions seen in ASD are manifestations of hyperacusis, reflecting disordered loudness perception. However,
others contend that exaggerated emotional responses to specific acoustic stimuli underlie these behaviors, indicating that
DST in ASD could be a form of misophonia, a psychiatric disorder characterized by excessive emotional reactions to
specific “trigger” sounds. To date, little empirical work has tested these hypotheses against one another, and it remains an
open question whether DST in ASD reflects hyperacusis, misophonia, or a combination of the two. Furthermore, it
remains unknown whether these symptoms are associated with alterations in the peripheral or central auditory system.
 The proposed study aims to answer these questions using a two-stage approach. In stage 1, we will construct a novel
self-report questionnaire that assesses a wide range of DST symptoms spanning the four theoretical domains of loudness,
pain, annoyance (i.e., misophonia), and fear. Available measures of DST typically assess only the loudness (hyperacusis)
or annoyance (misophonia) dimensions, failing to address a number of other clinically significant symptoms. Utilizing
large online samples of adults with and without ASD, we will refine and psychometrically validate our questionnaire for
use as a quantitative measure of transdiagnostic DST symptoms. In stage 2, we will recruit adults with ASD (both with
and without DST) and healthy controls from the community, characterizing their auditory function using a battery of
psychoacoustic and physiological tests. Auditory perception will be assessed using pure tone audiometry, loudness
discomfort level testing, and categorical loudness scaling. Underlying auditory physiology will be assessed from the
middle ear to auditory cortex using a combination of tympanometry, acoustic reflex testing, otoacoustic emission
suppression, brainstem/cortical auditory event-related potentials, and auditory steady-state responses. Objective auditory
measures will be compared between diagnostic groups, and relationships between these measures and subjective DST
symptomatology (based on established surveys and the novel self-report developed in stage 1) will be explored across the
full stage 2 sample. This project will answer the fundamental question of whether DST in ASD represents a variant of
hyperacusis, misophonia, or a combination of the two. Furthermore, by relating DST symptoms to underlying physiology,
we will determine whether different dimensions of DST can be separated based on their physiologic correlates. Findings
from this study are expected to elucidate the psychological and physiological mechanisms of DST in ASD, improving our
understanding of this disabling symptom and guiding the development of targeted interventions for the ASD population."

This project is focused on understanding the mechanisms behind performance deficits that occur with
insufficient sleep. In particular, studies in humans have identified cognitive rigidity (compromised situational
adaptability in decision making) as a consequence of sleep deprivation (SD). Cognitive rigidity is influenced by
a striatopallidal brain circuit that is conserved in subhuman primates and rodents and involves a cell type that
expresses dopamine-type 2 (DrD2) and adenosine-type 2a (A2a) receptors. In the current studies, we will
employ mouse electrophysiology recordings and real-time striatal event imaging, in addition to a rat cognitive
flexibility task that is susceptible to SD. We will apply these techniques to transgenic mouse and rat models in
order to interrogate the role of the DrD2/A2a striatopallidal brain circuit in mediating the effects of SD at the
biochemical, receptor, regional (brain structure and electrophysiology) levels in addition to probing complex
whole organism behavior. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which DrD2 cell membrane localization and
intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration ([cAMP]i) in striatal medium spiny neurons vary as
a function of spontaneous and SD-induced sleep/wake cycles. This experiment will address our dynamic
interplay hypothesis that striatal DrD2 receptor availability and the inversely-related [cAMP]i function as cellular
mediators of sleep pressure in the striatum. In Aim 2, we will examine whether the activity of striatal DrD2/A2a
cells is necessary and sufficient to confer the negative impacts of SD on cognitive flexibility. We predict that
cell-type specific chemogenetic activation or inactivation of these neurons will mimic or rescue, respectively,
the behavioral consequences of SD in a touchscreen operant reversal task. The anticipated results of this
project will confirm the mechanistic role of the striatopallidal medium spiny neuron population in the
performance decrements that stem from sleep loss. Here, our focus is on dopaminergic signaling, but our
long-term objective is to elucidate how signaling mechanisms in the striatum and connected brain areas
converge to regulate the cognitive processes that are compromised by SD. Overall, this work will set the stage
for future inquiries by confirming cell type-specific SD mitigation targets in striatal circuitry. It will also inform
the public and scientific constituencies of potential mechanistic and compensatory approaches to
reversing/preventing the deleterious effects of sleep loss."

10874695,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this K01 award is to promote the development of Dr. Alan Lombard into an independent
prostate cancer researcher. The proposed project will expand understanding of PARP inhibition for the
treatment of prostate cancer and position Dr. Lombard, the principal investigator, to launch an independent line
of study. Furthermore, intense mentoring and focused training goals are described to facilitate Dr. Lombard's
transition from mentee to independent investigator. Advanced prostate cancer remains an incurable disease.
PARP inhibitors (PARPi), such as rucaparib and olaparib, are an exciting new therapy recently approved for
the treatment of a subset of patients. It is thought that PARPi's function by causing DNA damage and
exacerbating homologous recombination deficiency to elicit synthetic lethality. While PARP inhibition promises
to significantly improve the management of prostate cancer patients, questions remain regarding their use
including 1) how do PARP inhibitor sensitive prostate tumor cells respond to treatment and 2) what
mechanisms will ultimately give rise to PARP inhibitor resistance. To address these questions, two olaparib
resistant prostate cancer models were developed, LN-OlapR and 2B-OlapR, using the PARPi sensitive LNCaP
and C4-2B cell lines, respectively. OlapR models exhibit robust resistance to olaparib and cross-resistance to
other clinically relevant PARPi's. Preliminary data suggests that PARPi sensitive cells respond to treatment not
only through cell death but also through G2/M arrested, p21 dependent senescence, which may provide a
repository of surviving cells that evade PARPi cytotoxicity and give rise to resistance. PARPi induced
senescence leads to activation of the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) which promotes
maintenance of senescence and cellular viability. Interestingly, OlapR cells 1) do not increase p21 expression,
2) do not G2/M arrest, and 3) blunt senescence in response to PARP inhibition, suggesting that resistance is
predicated upon cell cycle checkpoint override, which data suggests can be targeted through inhibition of
CDK1. The observations lead to the hypothesis that PARPi induced p21 dependent senescence is
overcome in resistance through cell cycle checkpoint override. In Aim 1, studies will determine whether
senescence is a general response to PARPi's and mechanistically define the importance of p21 in this
phenotype. In Aim 2, characterization of the PARPi induced SASP will be undertaken, with emphasis on
understanding the role of IGFBP3, a known SASP factor. Lastly, Aim 3 will further develop the strategy of
targeting CDK1 for the treatment of PARPi resistant prostate cancer and seek to understand how resistant
cells override the G2/M checkpoint. The environment at UC Davis is replete with all the resources, expertise,
and faculty needed to foster the development of Dr. Lombard and completion of proposed studies. Dr.
Lombard will undergo a number of training activities, including workshops in proteomics, genomics, disease
modeling, and grant writing, and will be mentored by an expert team to guide him to independence."
10874782,"The long term goal of this study is to understand how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enters cells and how to block that process through the use of therapeutics. Like other enveloped viruses, SARS-CoV-2 cell entry begins with engagement at the cell-surface and is completed on release of the viral contents following membrane fusion. During the process of cell entry, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) engages the cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). Proteolytic activation of S is required to activate the fusion machinery which can be achieved by cell surface or endosomal proteases positing a model of cell surface and endosomal entry routes that depend on engagement of different host-cell molecules that vary among cell types. To interrogate the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 we developed a set of unique tools that permit application of single virion imaging approaches to track productive entry routes in an unbiased way and to help identify host factors coopted during viral entry. This imaging is facilitated by the use of a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in which its glycoprotein gene (G) was replaced with the spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection with monoclonal antibodies, soluble receptor and small molecule inhibitors correlates closely with inhibition of a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, corroborating that the chimera is an effective BSL2 surrogate to study SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated entry. This permits us to genetically modify a core protein of the VSV ribonucleoprotein core to render the particles visible by fluorescent microscopy. By combining this imaging approach, with genetic, chemical and biological perturbations, we will map the entry routes of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and then examine the effect of those perturbations on infection of cells with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. We will use this approach to determine how countermeasures currently in clinical trials including monoclonal antibodies, soluble ACE2, and two small molecule inhibitors apilimod and nafamostat block entry. Using genome-wide loss-of-function screens we will also interrogate the requirements for entry of SARS-CoV-2, under native and perturbed conditions to uncover new host proteins that are coopted during entry as potential additional targets for therapeutic intervention. Successful completion of this work will define the entry pathways that lead to productive SARS-CoV-2 infection, inform the mechanism by which multiple molecules in clinical development interfere with that process and unearth new host factors that are coopted during the entry pathway."
10895566,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA) comprise a
group of neurodegenerative diseases that share the pathophysiological mechanism of abnormal aggregation of
alpha-synuclein (αSyn). Promising attempts at disease modification in established synucleinopathies have
failed, raising the important issue that patients who have clinically overt, established disease are too advanced
for disease-modifying therapies to be efficacious. Therefore, strategies have evolved to allow for earlier
disease detection and confirmation which was pursued in our current grant period with focus on pure
autonomic failure (PAF). PAF has more recently been established as one of the synucleinopathies, and is
characterized by isolated autonomic failure without motor or cognitive deficits, representing a pre-motor stage
with high risk of conversion to MSA, PD, or DLB. The main goal of the current grant period was to identify and
validate spinal fluid (CSF) and MRI biomarkers of conversion of PAF to motor synucleinopathies. We have
accomplished that goal by identifying highly predictive mechanism-based CSF and MRI markers in established
synucleinopathies, that when applied to the pre-motor stage can predict conversion and conversion phenotype.
REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a condition with close association with synucleinopathies and frequently
presents as isolated RBD (iRBD) years before motor or cognitive symptoms develop. The relevance and
implications of iRBD as prodromal synucleinopathy has been well recognized, but to date there are no reliable
predictors of conversion, phenotype of conversion, or timing of conversion to an established synucleinopathy.
We have expanded the biomarkers developed to predict PAF phenoconversion to iRBD patients and identified
discrete CSF profiles akin to those seen in PAF and in manifest motor and cognitive synucleinopathies, so that
we are now in a position to test the biomarker potential of these markers at the prodromal stage.
In this renewal, we shall study sleep-study confirmed iRBD patients stratified by baseline CSF biomarker
phenotype (MSA-, PD/DLB, or normal type) along with healthy control subjects with serial clinical evaluations
combined with autonomic, CSF, and MRI biomarker studies. We will enhance the feasibility of reaching
recruitment goals for each biomarker phenotype by enriching recruitment with participants in the North
American Prodromal Synucleinopathy Consortium identified as biomarker phenotype required to reach our
recruitment goals. Secondly, we will continue to follow PAF patients enrolled during the current grant period
who have not yet phenoconverted to solidify the predictive value of developed biomarkers.
The findings from this renewal proposal should result in establishing biomarkers for the pre-motor and
prodromal stages of syncucleinopathies, which may translate to disease-modifying therapy trials standing a
better chance at demonstrating efficacy, and which may eventually even allow for diagnosing selected
neurodegenerative diseases at the preclinical stage."
10861070,"Project Summary
Due to their hyperproliferative nature and intrinsic genomic instability, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
cells exhibit high levels of replication stress, which occurs when the DNA replication machinery encounters
obstacles that impede the replication process. How TNBC cells adapt to these high levels of replication stress
remains poorly understood. These adaptive mechanisms, if identified, would reveal specific targets in TNBC
and provide an effective strategy for TNBC treatment. To this end, we generated innovative cell models and
discovered that one major mechanism required for TNBC cells to survive high replication stress is an increase
in the enzyme RNase H2. RNase H2 acts to remove ribonucleotides that have been improperly incorporated
into the genome, a key driver of replication stress. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed that
RNASEH2A, the catalytic subunit of RNase H2, is overexpressed in 89% of TNBC tumors and all the TNBC
cell lines that we tested. More importantly, we found that RNase H2 inhibition, by genetic depletion or by the
chemical inhibitor R14, specifically kills TNBC cells both in vitro and in vivo with minimal effects on
nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. These important findings indicate that RNase H2 inhibition may be
a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC treatment. Intriguingly, we also found that RNase H2 inhibition
activated the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway and increased expression of key T-cell-attracting
cytokines in TNBC cells and sensitized mouse TNBC tumors to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, suggesting that
the therapeutic effects of RNase H2 inhibition may be potentiated by anti-PD-1 therapy. All of these exciting
findings support the hypotheses that RNase H2 inhibition offers a promising therapeutic strategy to treat
TNBC and that it may be enhanced by anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. These hypotheses will be tested via 3
specific aims: (1) To identify the underlying mechanisms of the therapeutic efficacy of RNase H2 inhibition in
TNBC. We will determine if limiting levels of dNTPs leads to increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides
into the genomes of TNBC cells, and if inhibition of RNase H2 in TNBC prevents removal of these
misincorporated ribonucleotides, consequently leading to unsustainably high replication stress and cell death.
We will also evaluate the potential mechanisms mediating the escape of TNBC from RNase H2 inhibition and
strategies to overcome resistance. (2) To determine the therapeutic potential of R14 for TNBC treatment. We will
determine the in vivo tolerability of R14 in mice to determine the maximum tolerated dose as well as any potential
toxicities. We will then assess the efficacy of R14 treatment in 10 TNBC patient-derived xenograft models
representative of 5 TNBC subtypes. (3) To determine the therapeutic efficacy of the combination of RNase H2
inhibition with PD-1 immunotherapy in TNBC. We will evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the R14/PD-1
immunotherapy combination in TNBC using 5 syngeneic TNBC mouse models. We will also assess if and how
R14-mediated therapies affect the tumor immune microenvironment."
10811734,"Daily rhythms in animal behavior, physiology and metabolism are driven by cell-autonomous circadian clocks
that are synchronized by environmental cycles but maintain ~24h rhythms even in their absence. These clocks
keep circadian time and control overt rhythms via transcriptional feedback loops (TFLs). Because clock
dysfunction negatively impacts human health, characterizing mechanisms that drive TFLs is of critical
importance. The goal of this proposal is to understand how feedback repression, a key event controlling
rhythmic transcription, is achieved using two complementary model systems; the monarch butterfly and the
fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Animals possess two TFL paradigms with orthologous components: A
Drosophila-like (dl) paradigm in which CLOCK (CLK) activates and PERIOD (PER) represses transcription,
and a mammal-like paradigm (ml) in which CLK-BMAL1 activates and PER-CRYPTOCHROME (PER-CRY)
complexes repress transcription. Monarch butterflies have an ml clock, but unlike mammals, monarchs carry
single copies of clock activator and repressor genes, thus making it an attractive model to dissect clock
mechanisms relevant to mammals. Common features of dl and ml clocks are that PER complexes containing
CASEIN KINASE 1 (CK1) initiate transcriptional repression `on-DNA' by binding CLK complexes on E-box
elements, followed by CK1-dependent PER and CLK phosphorylation, removal of PER-CLK complexes from
E-boxes to initiate `off-DNA' repression, and ultimately PER degradation. How PER orchestrates transcriptional
repression is poorly understood. We recently identified a region in CLK that acts as a conserved molecular hub
to coordinate transcription activation and repression. The TRITHORAX (TRX) histone methyltransferase, which
activates transcription by binding this hub, is also essential for repressing transcription by permitting CLK-PER
binding. TRX mediates repression by directly or indirectly methylating the chaperonin HSP68, which is required
for CLK-PER binding and repression. We also discovered that CLOCK-Interacting Protein Circadian (CIPC)
also binds the CLK hub to repress transcription across animals. CIPC and TRX binding to the CLK hub
suggests that CIPC inhibits transcription by displacing TRX, altering TRX substrate specificity to permit HSP68
R45 methylation, promoting PER-CLK binding, removing CLK-CYC from DNA and/or promoting co-repressor
binding. These hypothetical CIPC functions will be tested in Aim 1. Our discovery that TRX methylation of
HSP68 is required for PER-CLK binding and repression suggests that HSP68 acts in concert with progressive
phosphorylation of unstructured PER and CLK regions to efficiently drive sequential structural changes that
control DNA binding and protein interactions needed to maintain a ~24h circadian cycle. This hypothesis will
be tested in Aim 2. Successful completion of these aims will provide mechanistic insight into how circadian
repression determines the phase, period and amplitude of transcriptional rhythms. Ultimately, such knowledge
may be broadly applied for diagnosis and treatment of diseases and ailments associated with clock dysfunction."
10824290,"ABSTRACT
Chronic kidney disease is a significant healthcare issue affecting >15% of the U.S. population and costing billions
in healthcare dollars annually. Transplantation is the best option for most patients with progressive disease,
resulting in a significant increase in life expectancy and improved quality of life compared to dialysis. The
potential U.S. deceased donor organ supply is estimated to exceed the current number of organs transplanted
by a factor of 4- to 5-fold, with a major limitation to the number of acceptable organs for transplant being the
ischemic injury sustained between recovery and implantation. A method to cryopreserve or “bank” kidneys prior
to transplant would effectively remove the influence of time from the supply chain of organ distribution. This
would allow a new paradigm for transplantation that would improve donor/recipient matching, allow for better
patient preparation, facilitate tolerance induction protocols, and increase organ utilization while improving graft
and patient survival. One promising approach that overcomes the limitations of conventional strategies is
vitrification—that is, cooling organs so quickly that they cannot undergo the phase transition from liquid to solid
ice. With the help of cryoprotective agents (CPAs), the organ enters a stable glass-like state wherein viable
storage is theoretically indefinite. The critical challenge, however, is rewarming without ice formation or cracking:
if rewarming is too slow, ice crystals form, and if rewarming is not uniform, thermal stress causes cracking. During
our initial R01 funding, we developed a novel approach termed “nanowarming” that achieved both objectives.
Iron oxide nanoparticles were perfused throughout the vasculature of the organ along with CPA solutions. The
organ was then vitrified by cooling and rewarmed on-demand by placing it in a radiofrequency coil that induces
heating in the nanoparticles and, therefore, from within the organ. We found that nanowarming could rewarm
vitrified organs, including kidneys, in animal models. We have recently shown, for the first time, that nanowarmed
organs function in vitro and in vivo following transplantation. Further, we showed successful vitrification and
nanowarming of human-sized (porcine) kidneys. These new data support the feasibility of our approach to
cryopreserve and nanowarm whole human organs for transplantation. Nevertheless, many questions
remain, including how nanowarmed kidneys function compared to control organs, what, if any, injury occurs
during nanowarming, and how to scale up to human-sized organs. In this renewal R01, we propose to: (1)
Quantitatively assess cryopreserved and nanowarmed kidney transplant function in a rat model, including long-
term preservation, long-term function, modes of injury, and alterations of the host immune response, (2) Engineer
and optimize scale-up for nanowarming vitrified human-sized organs, and (3) Vitrify and nanowarm human-sized
kidneys while measuring viability, structural integrity, and organ function."
10814963,"Project Summary
 This proposal examines the previously unaddressed role of altered retinoid metabolism in heart failure
(HF). We have recently shown that in both idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) and experimental heart
failure (HF) there is up to a 40% decline in the cardiac levels of the vitamin A metabolite and potent hormone,
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), despite adequate vitamin A. We have also shown that direct administration of
ATRA prevents HF, in response to pressure-overload. However, implementing ATRA therapy for HF could face
headwinds, given the pleiotropy of ATRA signaling and the limited half-life of ATRA in the circulation. Alternatively,
therapeutic specificity might best be achieved by targeting the enzymes of cardiac retinoid metabolism.
 This proposal addresses 3 critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the mechanism of ATRA
metabolism and its impact on the post-natal heart. 1. The enzymes that are responsible for the metabolism of
retinol to retinoic acid in the adult mammalian heart are unknown. We have begun to identify the pertinent
enzymes in human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hSC-CMs). We show that Dhrs4 regulates the
retinaldehyde pool in human stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes hSC-CMs. We detail a workflow to validate other
candidates, leveraging advances hSC-CMs and human engineered heart tissue (hEHT). 2. The
pathophysiological mechanisms of a clinically-pertinent cardiac ATRA insufficiency have not been addressed.
Knockout of cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (Crbp1) recapitulates the ATRA decline seen in human IDCM.
Herein, we show the ATRA decline is sufficient to cause diastolic dysfunction and slow myofibrillar relaxation
kinetics. We evaluate the role of the retinaldehyde reductase Dhrs4 by conditional cardiac knockout in the mouse
heart. We test the hypothesis that boosting cardiomyocyte ATRA can prevent or even rescue HF and ameliorate
cross-bridge cycling. We propose to manipulate DHRS4 and ATRA levels to identify ATRA-sensitive
transcriptional programs in mouse hearts, and hEHT. 3. How pervasive the ATRA decline is across HF etiologies
is unknown, though proteomic biosignatures of ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) and HF with preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF) are consistent with ATRA decline. Even so, another study has shown increased cardiac ATRA
in the setting of advanced coronary heart disease. Identifying suitable cohorts for ATRA homeostasis therapy
requires that the magnitude and direction of ATRA changes in HF be quantified across HF etiologies. We will
quantify retinoids and retinoid-associated protein multiple etiologies including HF with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF), HFpEF, ICM, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), using state-of-the-art targeted mass
spectrometry assays (LC-MS3, isPRM) and examine their distribution within the heart using MALDI-MS Imaging.
 Restated, this proposal addresses fundamentally novel cardiobiology of a transcriptional master regulator
with translational potential, by leveraging the latest advances in human heart cell engineering, novel mouse
models, advanced mass spectrometry techniques, and human HF cohorts."
10660924,"Background: My long-term goal is to become an independent VA health services researcher focused on
designing and testing integrated care solutions to improve mental health and substance abuse (MHSA) services
access, quality, and outcomes for vulnerable Veteran populations. This CDA-2 will provide me with the
necessary mentorship, skills, and experiences to evaluate, modify and implement organizational changes that
improve MHSA outcomes for vulnerable Veterans in primary care settings.
 Significance/Impact: Veterans who have been homeless have high rates of depression and opioid use
disorder and barriers to accessing traditional primary care services. It is important to determine effective models
of MHSA services integration at this time when Veterans have more options for care in VA and community
settings. VA’s homeless patient aligned care team (H-PACT) program, implemented in over 60 VA facilities,
offers a natural laboratory to determine optimal approaches of MHSA services integration to advance Veteran
health. My research will impact Veteran health by determining the effectiveness of H-PACT for providing high
quality MHSA care and mitigating adverse MHSA outcomes among homeless-experienced Veterans; and by
determining the unique and potentially modifiable aspects of H-PACT and other patient aligned care teams
(PACTs) that could be scaled to achieve superior MHSA outcomes for homeless-experienced Veterans in
specialized and non-specialized PACT settings. This research strongly aligns with VA research priorities of
mental health and primary care, and legislative priorities related to addiction recovery and community care.
 Innovation: While prior studies suggest H-PACT improves primary care utilization and Veteran experiences
with care, there is less research focused on determining what features of H-PACT are successful. We lack data
on clinical process measures and outcomes for Veterans empaneled in H-PACTs, information on aspects of
MHSA services integration that exists within H-PACTs and traditional PACTs caring for homeless-experienced
Veterans, and the barriers and facilitators that contribute to MHSA quality for homeless-experienced Veterans.
 Specific Aims: My CDA-2 has three primary aims: 1) Compare MHSA services quality of care (e.g., clinical
performance measures for depression, opioid use disorder) and outcomes (e.g., psychiatric hospitalization,
opioid-related overdose, suicide) for homeless-experienced Veterans empaneled in H-PACTs versus other
PACTs in the same facilities; 2) Measure levels and features of MHSA services integration (e.g., coordination
with community services, co-location of providers, full integration) for homeless-experienced Veterans in H-
PACTs and other PACTs; and 3) Evaluate MHSA service practices and barriers in 4 facilities ranked low and 4
ranked high on measures of MHSA services quality for homeless-experienced Veterans. I will work with my
mentors to develop the expertise to study MHSA services quality in primary care settings, and to augment my
foundational training with new skills in survey design, qualitative methods and implementation science.
 Methodology: I aim to 1) use VA administrative data to operationalize MHSA services quality of care based
on VA performance measures and established definitions; 2) adapt an organizational survey of H-PACT
structures to survey providers from H-PACTs and PACTs about how MHSA services integration is achieved for
homeless-experienced Veterans, and; 3) conduct stakeholder interviews in low and high performing facilities to
identify barriers to delivering high quality MHSA services for homeless-experienced Veterans.
 Next Steps/Implementation: Findings will provide information to VA providers, operational partners, and
leadership about the effectiveness of the H-PACT initiative, and targets for intervention to bolster lower
performing H-PACTs. My pre-implementation research findings and training experiences will inform my future
work focused on MHSA outcomes in specialized PACT settings, including an HSR&D effectiveness-
implementation study (IIR) application to improve MHSA services quality for homeless Veterans in PACTs."

disparities and improve diabetes prevention and management. There is also an emphasis on building new
partnerships and collaborations among policy and systems experts, diabetes scientists, and community
stakeholders. PASSA provides a cohesive structure to deliver services that use policy and systems science
analysis enabling WU-CDTR investigators to enhance the quality and efficiency of their work. PASSA addresses
the large gap between the ability of researchers to link policy and systems interventions to the outcomes and
prevention of diabetes. This gap suggests the need for services to assist in conducting policy and systems
research targeting prevention and self-management of diabetes. By focusing on policy and systems methods,
PASSA will further support diabetes-relevant research across the T2-T4 spectrum and promote translational
research that is more likely to have long lasting environmental impact and produce systems changes that lead to
positive clinical, economic, policy, and health outcomes.
 The aims of PASSA are to: (1) improve and expand the use of innovative and state-of-the-art policy
research methods among WU-CDTR investigators; (2) enhance the use of novel systems science methods
among WU-CDTR investigators; and (3) increase the capacity for policy and systems science methods in
diabetes translation research among WU-CDTR investigators.
 PASSA has been used to support WU-CDTR investigators conducting diabetes policy and systems
research, analysis, and evaluation. This novel Core has evolved based on input from investigators to better
provide new services to meet a growing demand in the frontier area of systems science research. PASSA now
provides an efficient interface between investigators and comprehensive policy- and systems-analytic research
services that improve the quality of translational research in diabetes and is aligned with WU-CDTR themes of
health equity, dissemination & implementation, and team science."

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are huge macromolecular assemblies that serve as the only conduit for
bidirectional transport between the nucleus and cytoplasm. We have determined the constituents, architecture,
and detailed high precision structure of the archetypal yeast NPC. However, despite our increasing structural
information on NPCs, we still lack a fundamental understanding of the mechanics of numerous of its functions.
With our detailed maps in hand, we are, for the first time, in a unique position to map and reveal the structural
changes associated with functional states that throw light on mechanisms underlying critical aspects of NPC
function. Our hypothesis is that, despite some overlap, discrete and distinct structural stages and states are
associated with NPCs’ varied functions. We have therefore established a powerful pipeline for analyzing NPCs
and their vicinal associated complexes both structurally and functionally in defined functional states onto which
we map quantitative phenotypic information. This information will allow us to move from static models of NPCs
to working models of the machine in action, breathing life into our NPC maps and dissecting out how particular
functionalities are mechanistically supported at the structural level. We focus on two such functionalities that are
central to nuclear function at two related levels: first, as a regulator of transport, NPCs control mRNA packaging
and export to the cytoplasm to both mediate and regulate gene expression; and second, NPCs directly control
genes by binding chromatin and its regulators to alter expression states epigenetically. Both processes are
incompletely understood at the molecular level, and have profound effects on cellular function as evidenced by
the fact that disruptions of NPC-associated proteins associated with these functions lead to many human
diseases. For Aim 1, we will determine the molecular machinery of NPC-mediated mRNP export by studying
NPCs effectively “frozen” in defined intermediate stages of mRNP export. For Aim 2, we will determine the
molecular machinery of NPC-mediated chromatin organization, specifically focusing on subtelomeric gene
silencing. Using our established pipeline, we will identify and structurally characterize these NPC stages and
states and their vicinal interactomes. Realizing these Aims will generate NPC structure-function maps in
unprecedented detail, which will be of great use to the field to understanding how the mRNP export and
chromatin remodeling machineries act in concert with different parts of the NPC to enable their functionalities
and will shed light on the nature of numerous disorders associated with dysfunction in these processes. The
resulting structure-function NPC maps promise to set the stage for tapping the NPC’s tremendous potential as
a drug target for many human conditions ranging from cancers to infectious diseases to developmental and
neurological disorders.

10811744,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Seizures are a common and morbid complication of intracranial hemorrhage, leading to brain herniation, worse
patient outcome, and death. While a few risk factors for seizures have been described, the ability to predict
seizures is still crude. The inaccuracy of seizure prediction leads to imprecise administration of prophylactic
antiseizure medications. Prophylactic antiseizure medications are intended to prevent seizures, reduce
complications, and improve patient outcomes. Unfortunately, antiseizure medications have been independently
associated with more complications, worse patient outcomes, and worse health-related quality of life (HRQoL),
particularly cognitive function HRQoL. Better methods are needed to predict precisely which patients are likely
to have seizures after intracranial hemorrhage to prevent them, and, further, to determine which patients are
likely to benefit from prophylactic antiseizure medications.
We will continue a successful line of research. At the time we began to study this topic, prophylactic phenytoin
was recommended by guidelines. After publications implicated phenytoin with more complications and worse
patient outcomes, guidelines were changed to discourage the use of prophylactic phenytoin, and clinicians
broadly switched from phenytoin to levetiracetam. We recently reported that prophylactic levetiracetam is
independently associated with worse cognitive function HRQoL in the 40% of patients who receive it,
underscoring that current practice may lead to inadvertent harm, an untenable status quo. The effects of
seizures on HRQoL are worse than prophylactic antiseizure medication. Preventing seizures by precise
administration of prophylactic antiseizure medication would be helpful.
This proposal has two major aims that will improve patient outcomes after intracranial hemorrhage. First, we
will build upon our previous work to derive and validate a multi-dimensional model for predicting seizures after
intracranial hemorrhage from electroencephalography and imaging data to identify the patients most likely to
benefit from prophylactic seizure medication. A prospective database with recording of seizures and patient
outcomes provides preliminary data. Future data will be electronically abstracted from a health care system
with a single electronic health record using automated techniques from electroencephalography reports, raw
electroencephalography data, and neuroimaging source data. Then, we will determine the effect of
prophylactic seizure medication on patient HRQoL at high risk for seizures, and use other machine learning
techniques to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from prophylactic antiseizure medication. At
the conclusion of this proposal, we will deliver a model to predict patients most likely to have seizures, and
determine which patients are likely to have higher HRQoL as a results of prophylactic seizure medications,
leading to targeted treatment and non-treatment to maximize patient HRQoL."
10851031,"Among community-living older adults, falls are a leading cause of injury, disability, injury-related death, and high
medical costs. Despite decades of research, the proportion of older adults who fall has not declined. Identifying
older adults at risk of falls remains a major public health priority. Exercise and other interventions can lower fall
risk; however, new tools are needed to determine who is most likely to benefit from early interventions.
 Early research linking fall risk to gait measures obtained in the clinic (e.g., average speed, stride variability)
contributed significantly to the understanding of the prediction of fall risk. Studies have also shown that older
adults who are more active have reduced risks of falls and fall-related injury. However, critical gaps
remain. Exciting advances in digital medicine and remote monitoring using wearable devices have afforded new
and more widely accessible opportunities for evaluating the relationships between Daily Living Gait (DLG) and
Daily Living Physical Activity (DLPA) to injurious falls in older adults. Measures of DLG (e.g., gait speed, cadence,
variability, and how these vary throughout the week) and measures of DLPA (e.g., activity levels and activity
fragmentation) can all be derived from a single accelerometer worn for 1 week. While growing evidence suggests
that DLG and DLPA do a better job at predicting falls than conventional in-clinic measures, studies to date have
been relatively small and have not focused on the prediction of injurious falls. Moreover, little is known about the
utility of combining DLG and DLPA measures to predict injurious falls.
 To address these gaps, we will leverage: 1) an existing large dataset of older women enrolled in the Women’s
Health Study (WHS) and 2) advances in wearable technology and machine learning. From 2011 to 2015, 17,466
WHS women wore a tri-axial accelerometer during waking hours for a week; they also regularly self-reported
their physical activity levels and health history. We propose to evaluate, for the first time, if and how DLG and
DLPA measures predict fall-related injuries in this aging cohort (average age=72 years at the time of
accelerometer wear) using records of injurious falls from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).
Primary Aims 1 and 2 will evaluate which specific measures of DLG and DLPA are associated with the risk of
injurious falls in the subsequent year after assessment, using statistical and machine learning approaches that
use time-to-event analyses (with and without adjustments for covariates). Primary Aim 3 will evaluate whether
utilizing measures of both DLG and DLPA is more strongly associated with the risk of injurious falls than utilizing
each of these measures alone. We will also determine if self-reported exercise history is associated with DLG
and DLPA, and explore whether markers of DLG and DLPA are associated with risks of injurious falls over more
extended periods of 5 and 10 years, as secondary and exploratory aims. By taking advantage of a unique, large
dataset, our multi-disciplinary team will identify potential “signatures” to identify high-risk adults who may benefit
from early fall prevention strategies and markedly accelerate the potential of using digital markers of fall risk."
10874642,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation and bronchial obstruction due to human airway smooth
muscle (HASM) shortening. However, the underlying basis for an enhanced shortening or the hyper-contractile
state of HASM in asthma is not known. Further, our incomplete understanding of type 2 (T2) inflammation-
regulated excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in HASM shortening has hindered the development of new
HASM bronchodilators with a novel mechanism of action for over 60 years. This application seeks to gain a
foundational knowledge on the mechanical endotypes of HASM shortening in asthma (inflammation-dependent
and -independent) and identify improved bronchodilators that are less susceptible to tolerance and less
affected by immune inflammatory responses in asthma, focusing on previously unrecognized mechanisms
evoked by bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) expressed on HASM. Our preliminary data, in pre-clinical models,
support a premise that the immunologic and/or pathogenic mechanisms associated with a sustained
mechanical reinforcement of HASM shortening, and the loss of β2-adrenoceptor (β2AR)-mediated
bronchodilation, involve a transcriptional repressor function of the polycomb group (PcG) protein EZH2
(enhancer of zeste homolog 2). Further, our preliminary studies find a mechanistic role for microRNA-214
(miR-214) in TAS2R-evoked translational inhibition of EZH2. Based on these results, we hypothesize that
TAS2Rs on HASM inhibit T2 cytokine-regulated E-C coupling in HASM shortening and the physiological loss of
β2AR function in EZH2- and miR-214-dependent manners. Our goals are, first, to characterize T2- and non-T2-
mediated molecular kinetics and mechanics of E-C coupling in HASM shortening and, second, determine miR-
epigenetic nexus (i.e., non-genetic mechanisms) by which TAS2R activation promotes the functional efficacy of
β2ARs and inhibits the mechanical endotypes of HASM shortening in asthma. Toward this end, we will
leverage our unique technological innovations of single-molecule and single-cell micromechanical methods
and integrative genetics and genomics approaches in clinically relevant human precision cut lung slices
(hPCLS) and primary HASM cells derived from donor lungs of patients with and without severe asthma. When
successful, the knowledge gained from these experimental and computational studies will: 1) shed new light on
inflammation-dependent and -independent regulation of E-C coupling in HASM shortening; 2) uncover
previously unidentified TAS2R paradigms to mitigate the physiological loss of β2AR function; and 3) establish
new druggable targets and agents to treat β2-agonist-insenstivity in a large cohort of patients with difficult-to-
control and severe asthma. This line of research is underappreciated in asthma and represents a clear shift in
the asthma treatment paradigm."
10817911,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
State of the art methods for the early detection and monitoring of cancer are either invasive, time-consuming,
expensive, or frequently inaccurate, which hinders the routine screening of at risk-patients to improve survival
rates. The multiplexed detection of oncometabolites circulating in minimally or non-invasive biofluids, such as
saliva, blood plasma, or sweat, could provide significant clinical and economic benefits. Metabolites and related
circulating biomarkers are structurally unique elements with distinctive absorptive fingerprints in the infrared (IR)
portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Common approaches that provide multiplexed metabolite detection,
such as mass spectrometry (MS), Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
are expensive and difficult to miniaturize. On the other hand, inexpensive miniaturized electrochemical techniques
lack specificity, sensitivity, ease, and suffer from limited multiplexing. Portable technologies capable of rapid and
accurate diagnostics of early/late-stage cancer are not readily available.
To address this challenge, our multidisciplinary team proposes an innovative Neural Network Enabled Cancer
Spectroscopy (NNECS) liquid biopsy platform based on plasmonic nano-micro electromechanical systems
(NMEMS) to diagnose and monitor early/late-stage head neck cancer (HNC). Instead of targeting individual
metabolites, we propose to process the entire IR spectrum of saliva, blood plasma, and sweat as a biomarker.
Our focus is head and neck cancer (HNC), a highly metabolic disease where stratification of patients according
to better diagnostic information would greatly improve outcomes. Our platform combines IR NMEMS sensors to
accurately detect IR spectral fingerprints with neural network (NN) frameworks to find the appropriate
combinations of spectral bands that will inform the design of highly multiplexed miniaturized biosensor.
We will take a novel, interdisciplinary approach within the framework of five key components: (i) collecting and
analyzing (FTIR, MS, histopathology/imaging) biofluids (saliva, sweat, blood) from a large number of early/late
stage HNC patients and healthy subjects per year; (ii) developing powerful NN architectures and diagnosis tools
for segregating early/late-stage HNC samples from controls, considering IR data streams from each individual
biofluid as well as their potential combinations; (iii) developing a NNECS platform using arrays of plasmonic
NMEMS targeting specific IR bands resolved by ML algorithms; (iv) determining NNECS early/late-stage cancer
detection performance in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy; and (v) elucidating which metabolites
drive the changes in the IR absorption of cancer biofluids supported by MS. The expected outcome is a
miniaturized, label-free, affordable, and accurate technology able to radically improve the ability to diagnose early-
stage HNC as well as the monitoring of recurrent HNC patients. Moving beyond, NNECS can be adapted for the
diagnosis and monitoring of a wide range of metabolic conditions, including many types of cancer, diabetes, and
heart-diseases."
10834217,"Project Summary. Pulmonary Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (PLCH) is a rare interstitial lung disease,
which occurs almost exclusively in cigarette smokers and has a median duration of survival from of of
12.5 years. PLCH is characterized by,Langerin+ dendritic cell (DC) accumulation, inflammatory lesions,
nodule formation and cystic remodeling. Recently, a causative link between acquired BRAF (kinase in
RAS pathway) mutations in the myeloid/monocyte lineage and the development of benign neoplasms
has been reported, and a common, acquired mutation in BRAF (V600E) was found in lung lesions of
more than half of PLCH patients. Although this causal link represents an important breakthrough, the
mechanisms by which mutant histiocytes control the initiation and progression of PLCH are unknown. To
address this critical knowledge gap, we have developed preclinical models that recapitulate hallmark
features of PLCH. We show that cigarette smoke (CS) exposure of mice expressing an inducible
BRAFV600E mutation in CD11c+ cells exhibit peribronchiolar inflammation, nodule formation, and
airspace enlargement accompanied by cyst-like formations. These structural changes are accompanied
by alterations in DC homeostasis, including increased expression of and responsiveness to the
chemokine CCL20. Further, our data suggest the BRAFV600E-dependent production of the pleiotropic
cytokine CCL7 is a potential driver of the inflammatory lesions in PLCH. Finally, we demonstrate that the
BRAF mutation induces DC senescence accompanied by upregulation of non-classical MHC ligands that
permit the DCs to evade immune-mediated clearance. Based on these novel preliminary data, we
hypothesize that PLCH pathogenesis is initiated by a combination of BRAF mutations along with CS
exposure to amplify CCL20 mediated histiocyte accumulation followed by the recruitment of inflammatory
cells/nodule development via CCL7 production and the amplification of this process is preserved by
BRAF-dependent expression of ligands for inhibitory receptors on cytotoxic lymphocytes. We will test this
hypothesis with three inter-related, yet independent, Specific Aims. We expect the completion of the
research will lead to new conceptual advances in PLCH. While PLCH is rare, we believe the preclinical
model will lead to insights into the role of BRAFV600E cells in PLCH. This model provides a compelling
platform for preclinical studies in the short term and evidence based clinical trials in the long term, and
should enable the development of treatments of a life threatening pulmonary disease. This goal may be
viewed as aggressive but the identification of an effective treatment for lymphanioleiomyomatosis by our
group and promising clinical trials underway by our group as part of the Rare Lung Disease Consortium,
are direct evidence that effective therapies can be found quickly when clues of nature are abundant,
molecular targets are known, biological plausibility is high and patient communities are well organized."
10817946,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's Diseases—the most common cause of dementia in aging adults—is a slow, but progressive,
deterioration of the brain that leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. The classic
neuropathological sign of the disease is the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ)-containing plaques, which can
lead to neuronal damage when free Aβ oligomers form Ca2+-permeable pores, causing membrane
permeabilization and neuronal cell death. More recently, cardiovascular pathologies have been implicated in
the progression of Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia. However, how these pathologies
contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease is poorly understood; how vascular dysfunction
potentiates the failure to clear toxic Aβ from ageing brains. Our recent work provides evidence that
capillaries—the smallest vascular conduits and the point of nutrient delivery and waste removal blood and
surrounding neurons—act as a sensory network that detects and responds to neural activity by promoting an
increase in local blood flow. In addition, we observe that contractile ensheathing pericytes maintain the
efficiency of network perfusion by controlling blood flow at capillary junctions. In Preliminary Results, we
provide new evidence that Aβ peptide for Ca2+ permeable pores, leading to the increases of Ca2+ events in
contractile pericytes, but not in nearby vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, we show that Aβ peptide-
mediated increases in the frequency of Ca2+ events lead to Ca2+ store depletion and inhibition of the voltage-
gated Ca2+ channels. We propose to test our overarching hypothesis that Aβ leads to the progressive loss of
pericyte function at capillary junctions leading to a reduction in capillary network perfusion efficiency, ultimately
affecting the health and function of surrounding neurons. The aims of the current study are 1) To test the
hypothesis that differences in membrane lipid environments enable free Aβ oligomers to form Ca2+-permeable
pores in capillary pericytes; 2) To test the hypothesis that free Aβ oligomers deplete internal Ca2+ stores,
leading to STIM1-mediated inhibition of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels; and 3) To elucidate the effects of Aβ
oligomers on local and regional blood flow. Successful completion of these studies is expected to provide
insights into how amyloid-β peptide accumulation disrupts blood flow within the microenvironment to negatively
impact neuronal vitality and provide therapeutic targets for the prevention of the neurodegeneration that leads
to cognitive impairment and dementia."
10835061,"Project Summary
A central question in the field of Evo-Devo is how genes controlling embryonic development change during
evolution. Many recent advances in Evo-Devo have identified genetic changes that are associated with the
acquisition of, or changes in, external body features, such as alterations in pigmentation patterns or development
of body armor. In contrast, our studies are novel in this field as they have revealed unexpected genetic variation
underlying a highly conserved trait: the shared segmented body plan of insects. The genes controlling
segmentation encode transcription factors that are required for embryonic development and viability. The cohort
of genes responsible for segment formation include pair-rule genes (PRGs) identified in the model insect
Drosophila. Mutations in Drosophila PRGs result in lethality accompanied by loss of alternate segmental regions.
Thus, it was surprising to find differences in the presence, expression, or function of PRGs in different insect
taxa. The work proposed here is designed to understand the mechanistic basis for this genetic variation, which
we have observed in different insect lineages. To carry out functional studies, we have developed molecular
genetic approaches in diverse insect species in our lab. The establishment of multiple non-model systems
simultaneously within one lab has synergistic effects due to sharing of protocols and troubleshooting strategies,
allowing us to develop new techniques more effectively in different species. With these tools in hand, we will
examine the underlying bases of specific scenarios of genetic variation: In Aim 1, we will ask how PR-patterning
is achieved without canonical PRGs in the milkweed bug Oncopeltus where we have found novel utilization of
PRGs compared to Drosophila. Aim 2 will explore the evolutionary trajectory of the Oncopeltus PRG network
across insect groups. Aim 3 will decipher mechanisms underlying loss of an essential PRG in both mosquitoes
and butterflies. These studies will contribute to our understanding of fundamental mechanisms regulating
embryonic development and how these mechanisms have changed during the radiation of insects. This project
will train postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and at least five undergraduate students in molecular biology,
genetics, and molecular evolution. Establishment of molecular techniques in non-model and emerging model
insect species, including expression analysis, RNA interference, CRISPR/Cas9, FAIRE-seq, and transgenesis,
not only allows us to answer fundamental questions about embryonic development, but also provides molecular
tools for translational studies of insects that pose a risk to human health."
10814959,"ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects up to half of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). In
patients with AKI and hemodynamic instability, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the
preferred dialysis modality. ICU mortality in this vulnerable population is high but kidney recovery occurs in
up to two-thirds of survivors. Universally accepted and accurate approaches for predicting survival or kidney
recovery in these patients do not exist currently. This is clinically relevant as prediction of key outcomes
could guide decision-making of CRRT delivery, goals of acute care, and personalized post-ICU care
according to kidney recovery prognosis. Since there are no proven interventions to improve outcomes in
these patients, identification of modifiable risk factors and sub-phenotypes is necessary to develop precision
medicine approaches in CRRT. Due to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and availability of multi-modal
data, deep learning (DL) –a subset of AI– is a valuable approach that allows construction of accurate and
reliable risk prediction models. Further, the use of novel algorithms such as the Feasible Solution Algorithm
(FSA) could help identify patient sub-phenotypes and model applications. We propose to develop and
validate innovative and reproducible DL approaches to predict RRT-free survival at actionable timepoints
and use FSA to identify patient sub-phenotypes with differing RRT-free survival risk according to multi-
modal data. Our published preliminary data demonstrated superiority of DL models compared to optimized
logistic regression for RRT-free survival prediction. Prediction of 24-hour mortality was improved by
incorporating time-series data during CRRT. We hypothesize that time-series multi-modal data
(including EHR and CRRT machine data) will generate accurate and generalizable risk prediction to
guide clinical interventions and identify sub-phenotypes for model interpretation and clinical utility
testing. We will utilize datasets from 9 institutions that encompass multi-modal EHR clinical data and
programmatic and therapy data from CRRT machines for model and sub-phenotyping development, testing,
and independent validation. This innovative research will 1) assist development of clinical decision support
platforms to guide informed CRRT delivery and improve clinical outcomes and 2) identify sub-phenotypes of
patients that could benefit from more personalized and testable novel CRRT interventions."
10829927,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, have improved the survival of patients with
metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, only a subset (<20%) of patients
responds to single agent ICI. Since ICI acts by blocking the negative regulators of pre-existing anti-tumor T cell
immunity, the lack of response of the majority of HNSCC patients to anti-PD-1 mAb suggests that most HNSCC
patients either do not have pre-existing anti-tumor immunity or that other immunosuppressive pathways play a
dominant role. Therefore, combining anti-PD-1 mAb with a vaccination approach that can induce anti-tumor T
cell immunity is likely to be more effective than single agent ICI. However, patient-to-patient variation in target
antigens makes HNSCC one of the most challenging cancers for developing an effective therapeutic vaccine.
To address this, we propose to develop a novel vaccine immunotherapy to treat HNSCC using an approach that
is personalized, thus incorporating patient-to-patient variation in antigenic signature. Our autologous therapeutic
vaccine consists of tumor membrane vesicles (TMVs) made from the patients’ tumors conjugated to potent
immunostimulatory molecules (ISMs) by protein transfer. In contrast to previous autologous tumor lysate
vaccines, the tumor antigens are physically linked to ISMs via a TMV scaffold in our vaccines, thus
simultaneously presenting the patient’s unique tumor antigen signature and ISMs to the immune cells to induce
effective anti-tumor responses. Such a physical linkage of antigens and adjuvants has been shown to induce a
more effective immune response than a mixture of unconjugated antigens and adjuvants. Furthermore, unlike
whole cell vaccines, TMV vaccines do not secrete immunosuppressive factors. TMVs are particulate in nature
and carry membrane associated tumor antigens, altered carbohydrate antigens, and antigenic epitopes derived
from cytosolic proteins in the form of major histocompatibility complex associated peptides. Our preliminary
studies show that TMV vaccine in combination with ICI is more effective than ICI alone in murine oral cancer
models. We hypothesize that a personalized vaccine immunotherapy will expand tumor-specific T cells and the
addition of ICI prevents the exhaustion of tumor antigen-specific T cells to induce robust anti-tumor T cell
responses and significantly enhance the clinical response against HNSCC tumors that are not responsive to
currently approved immunotherapies. The hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims: Aim 1: To
determine whether the dose and schedule can be altered to increase the anti-tumor immune response and
efficacy of TMV vaccine in a mouse model of HNSCC, Aim 2: To investigate whether TMV vaccine inhibits
metastasis/recurrence and extends the survival of mice in a clinically relevant setting, and Aim 3: To conduct a
phase 1b dose-escalation clinical trial of TMV-based immunotherapy alone and in combination with
pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. Completion of the proposed work will advance
a novel, personalized vaccine immunotherapy approach for patients with recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC."
10886702,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The actin cytoskeleton is a major cellular component with key functions in virtually every aspect of cell
physiology including cell motility, shape and mechanics, cell and tissue morphogenesis, cell-cell and cell-matrix
interactions, and dynamics of membrane organelle. Aberrations in actin cytoskeleton structure, functions
and/or dynamics contribute significantly to human pathologies, especially to cancer and neurodegenerative,
immune and cardiovascular diseases. The actin cytoskeleton plays indispensable roles in cells due to its ability
to generate large pushing, pulling and resistance forces in many different combinations. To perform these
diverse functions, actin filaments are organized into diverse structural arrays by multiple accessory proteins.
Despite extensive research, the exact organization of these actin-based molecular machineries is frequently
unknown. The main barrier toward this goal is the difficulty of resolving actin cytoskeleton architecture at a
single-filament level. Without knowledge of the structure, functional understanding of the machinery is
incomplete. My lab uses a distinctive approach to overcome this problem. We take advantage of platinum
replica electron microscopy (PREM), which is uniquely able to combine high resolution imaging of the
cytoskeleton with full coverage of the whole cell and to efficiently correlate the cytoskeleton structure with live
cell dynamics. With help of PREM, my lab has made multiple fundamental contributions toward understanding
of cytoskeleton functions in a range of generic and specialized cell types. In this application, we propose in the
course of the next five years to address the following questions representing each of the four major categories
of actin cytoskeleton functions: (1) Protrusion – How microtubules regulate protrusive activity of the actin
cytoskeleton for directional migration; (2) Contraction – How an interplay between nonmuscle myosin II
paralogs regulates polarized subcellular distribution of contractile forces; (3) Cell mechanics – How differences
in the molecular architecture of the actin cortex are linked to different mechanical properties of normal and
cancer cells; (4) Membrane dynamics – How branched actin networks promote invagination of clathrin-coated
membrane domains. Our expertise in PREM in addition to a broad range of other cell biological, imaging,
functional, biochemical, and molecular biological methods puts us in unique position to significantly advance
our understanding of actin cytoskeleton functions. In turn, this knowledge may provide important new insights
into how to combat human diseases associated with actin cytoskeleton malfunctions."
10904877,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this K01 proposal is to provide Gina Tripicchio, PhD, MSEd, with the training and
mentorship to establish an independent program of research focused on innovative behavioral interventions to
improve dietary intake in high-risk adolescents. Added sugar (AS) is a prime target for dietary intervention in
adolescents; it contributes excess calories with no nutritional benefits, and adolescents consume more AS than
any other age group. High-risk adolescents (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities from low-income communities),
experience disproportionately higher rates of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases yet remain
understudied. A key limitation in developing efficacious trials for this high-risk group is the dearth of information
about key factors associated with AS intake. To address this gap, this project aims to characterize key drivers
of AS intake in high-risk adolescents using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA allows for the
examination of contextually specific dietary influences in real-time, while reducing recall bias and participant
burden. This rich information can be used to guide the development of a tailored, salient behavioral
intervention. Additionally, an objective stable isotope biomarker of AS has recently emerged and can be used
to address key limitations of self-reported outcomes in dietary interventions. Two studies will be employed to
meet the aims of this project. Study 1 (years 1-2), will collect EMA from 40 adolescents and examine the
feasibility and acceptability of the δ13C biomarker in the target sample. Study 2 (years 3-5), will implement a
pilot RCT to test a contextually tailored, technology-enriched intervention in a sample of 70 adolescents, 12-16
years of age, from a low-income community in north Philadelphia. A 3-month behavioral intervention, including
group-based sessions, interactive text messaging and parent support, will aim to reduce AS intake compared
to an educational comparison group. Changes in AS, as measured by the δ13C biomarker, will be assessed as
the primary outcome and total changes in diet quality will be examined as a secondary outcome. A rigorous
training plan will complement the proposed research, facilitated by mentors who are experts in nutrition, eating
behavior, digital interventions, statistics, and behavioral trials in pediatric populations. Specific training
objectives include: 1) ecological momentary assessment, 2) multi-level statistical modeling, 3) assessment of
objective nutritional biomarkers and 4) designing and implementing behavioral interventions to address
disparities. Temple University's Center for Obesity Research and Education is an ideal setting for this work as
it provides extensive research resources and access to a population of diverse, high-risk youth. This K01 will
provide novel information about AS intake in high-risk adolescents and test a targeted, tailored intervention to
reduce consumption. Findings will support the application of a fully powered R01 trial. This award holds
significant potential for public health impact and will enable Dr. Tripicchio to establish a rigorous program of
research to improve dietary intake and reduce diet-related chronic disease risk in vulnerable adolescents."

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a disfiguring autoimmune skin disease with a predilection for affecting
the head and neck that causes permanent scarring, hypopigmentation, and alopecia. DLE disproportionately
affects African American women, and it severely impairs quality of life. DLE may occur alone or in the setting of
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and treatments for DLE are currently unsatisfactory. The DLE
inflammatory infiltrate is predominantly composed of T cells, which appear to promote tissue inflammation and
damage, but how they adapt to the skin environment and subsequently promote tissue injury is unknown. We
recently identified an inflammatory gene program induced by the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor
(HIF) that is necessary for the survival and effector ability of pathogenic T cells in lupus-prone mice, with a
similar program upregulated in human SLE. Yet, how HIF1 promotes damage and what other tissue adaptation
and effector pathways are activated in skin-infiltrating T cells in DLE are not known. Based on my preliminary
studies, I hypothesize that HIF1 regulates pathogenic T cell survival and effector function in DLE skin, causing
inflammation and damage that may be mediated in part by enhanced cytotoxicity. This HIF1-regulated effector
program also suggests a paradigm of pathogenic adaptation in tissue-infiltrating T cells with the potential to
drive tissue damage. To test my hypothesis, I will determine the mechanism of HIF1 blockade in alleviating
skin disease in a murine lupus model. I will also study human DLE skin and blood samples using single cell
RNA sequencing to probe the developmental trajectory, phenotypic, and functional profile of T cells in human
DLE. Finally, I will use imaging techniques to examine the role of cytotoxicity in tissue damage in human DLE,
with parallel studies in mouse tissue. My studies will not only elucidate the role of HIF1 and cytotoxicity in DLE,
but will also yield the first detailed characterization of infiltrating and circulating T cells in human DLE, paving
the way for future studies to develop and evaluate novel therapeutics for this devastating disease. My proposal
will also support a period of career development during which I will receive additional training in basic and
translational immunology in the laboratory of Dr. Joseph Craft, a leader in the fields of lupus research and T
cell biology. Dr. Craft's laboratory in the Yale Department of Immunobiology provides a highly collaborative and
supportive research environment. To further support my training, I have assembled an advisory committee with
experts in transcriptomic analyses, translational dermatology, cutaneous T cell biology, and autoimmune skin
disease. My research studies and directed additional career development activities focused on computational
approaches, human translational research, and biostatistics in clinical investigation will allow me to
successfully achieve research independence as a physician scientist and open my own laboratory so that I can
use basic and translational immunologic approaches to study cutaneous autoimmune diseases including DLE."

The broad, long-term goal of my research project is to understand the parameters controlling prion transmission
and evolution within and between species, and ultimately to prevent recurrent epidemics in humans and animals.
Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a burgeoning epidemic in cervids of increasingly uncertain zoonotic potential,
is a particular focus within this general framework. My research group is one of only a handful with the resources
and expertise in transgenic, cell biological, biochemical, molecular genetic and in vitro approaches to study prion
diseases. Our output has exerted a powerful and sustained influence on the field. This application leverages a
longstanding relationship with NINDS which is a feature of my uninterrupted record of NIH funding as an
independent investigator for a period covering 26 years. Since prion studies require long-term experimental
commitments requiring sustained and highly coordinated approaches, this proposal explores the feasibility of an
alternate funding mechanism with improved stability and flexibility leading to improved efficiency which will
enhance our already significant capacity to innovate, conduct transformative research, and capitalize on new
developments. This application is designed to build on the advancing trajectory of our research by addressing
key questions relating to naturally-occurring prion diseases with a particular focus on CWD. We will address the
prevalence, properties and origins of emergent and established CWD strains; explore how strain conformations
and species-specific PrP primary structural differences regulate interspecies prion transmission; investigate the
parameters which stabilize strain phenotypes or promote prion adaptation/evolution; address the roles played
by peripheral compartments and the central nervous system in strain selection/adaptation by the host; ascertain
the risks posed by established and emergent strains to humans; and determine the structural properties of CWD
prion strains at high resolution. The proposed mechanism also provides enhanced opportunities for dedicated
mentoring and supervision of trainees and senior scientists, and to optimize my ability to generate a legacy for
the next generation of independent investigators."

Center for whole mouse brain connectomics using high-throughput integrated volumetric
electron microscopy (HIVE)
 Two fundamental components of the structural basis of brain function are cell type composition and the
wiring diagram between those cells. Over the past decade there has been paradigm-shifting progress in
understanding cell type composition of the brain. Now it’s time to systematically uncover the brain’s wiring
diagram and place it into the context of cell types. Knowledge about the complete connectomes in C. elegans
and Drosophila have revolutionized the understanding of cell types and circuit function in those systems.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) has consistently led progress in that revolution and has the potential
to scale up to the entire mouse brain with technical improvements in certain areas. During the IARPA MICrONS
project, members of the HIVE team built a complete pipeline to section and image the mm3 and created the data
processing, reconstruction and analysis infrastructure to make cells and connections analyzable. The result was
a dataset with the largest EM level reconstructions of cells in any system, with neurons containing more than
14,000 inputs and 15,000 outputs. We accomplished this by applying a rigorous structured science process that
is a hallmark of the Allen Institute’s team science approach.
 In this project we aim to improve our pipeline, developing critical technologies to tackle the challenges of
scaling up to the whole mouse brain and linking to cell types. Our proposal will prepare and section an entire
hemisphere, image it at 120 nm resolution, and image up to 10 mm3 at synaptic resolution within the Cortical
Basal Ganglia Thalamic loop to provide key insights into circuit mechanisms within this circuit. To accomplish
this, we will need to improve all individual aspects of the pipeline, while maintaining consistent integration tests
that ensure that the pieces work together. We will standardize a whole mouse brain staining protocol and
advance the automation of serial sectioning to collection of serial TEM sections across a whole mouse brain.
Developments of serial section tilt TEM tomography will allow to scale EM imaging to a whole mouse brain at
multiple scales, leveraging the re-imaging capacity of serial section TEM. We will develop open source data
processing tools to bring down the cost of segmentation and while improving accuracy and integrating with a
real-time globally accessible proofreading and analysis platform. Finally, we will integrate our data with full
morphology reconstructions linked to gene expression, allowing us to create an integrated atlas of cell types
and connectivity. Our dissemination strategy will further amplify our impact by democratizing access for both
the scientific and educational community."
10833656,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The importance of achieving stone-free status during endoscopic kidney stone surgery is emphasized by the
high rate of repeat stone procedures due to residual fragments after index surgery. Specifically, residual stone
fragments can lead to obstruction, pain, kidney injury, and recurrent infections. Successful endoscopic stone
surgery requires the surgeon to visualize the entire renal collecting system and locate all kidney stones during
treatment. Several challenges can lead to incomplete stone treatment and include inadequate stone visibility and
difficulty navigating through the kidney. Specifically, blood or debris can frequently obscure the already limited
field of view during endoscopic stone surgery. Additionally, successfully navigating through the collecting system
requires the surgeon to mentally create a 3D model of the patient’s anatomy from preoperative 2D axial
computerized tomography (CT) images. During treatment, moreover, stones can fragment and disperse
throughout the collecting system, further complicating intraoperative tracking. Though technical constraints of
scopes may also impact surgical kidney stone outcomes, the above limitations of endoscopic stone treatment
prevent many surgeons from achieving a complete stone-free status.
Our overall goal is to create a navigational system that makes stone localization and tracking within the renal
collecting system easier and more accurate for the surgeon. Toward this goal, our specific objective in this
proposal is to test the hypothesis that a navigational system during endoscopic stone surgery can improve stone-
free rates, mitigating recurrent surgeries or complications from residual fragments. To test this hypothesis, we
propose two Specific Aims: Aim 1 involves the development of an automatic, real-time segmentation and tracking
system of kidney stones during endoscopic stone surgery. Aim 2 integrates a 3D navigational map of collecting
system anatomy and kidney stone location during endoscopic surgery. The endpoint of this R21 will be a fully
validated navigational system for endoscopic stone surgery and the necessary experimental data to power a
large-scale, multi-center clinical trial. As our navigational system would require only software integration to
current endoscopic surgical cameras, all existing endoscopic surgical systems could in principle immediately
benefit from the results of this project. In this way, we believe the success of our project will facilitate improved
stone-free rates and mitigate repeat interventions or complications, benefiting patients, surgeons, and society."
10828904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fidelity in directional motility is critical for development. This proposal addresses an outstanding question that
remains a major impasse in the field of developmental neurobiology: How does a single extracellular morphogen,
the secreted glycoprotein netrin-1, function as both a both a long-range diffusive cue vs a local, adhesive cue,
and both an attractive cue and a repulsive cue. Netrin-1 is critical in development of many organ systems and
branching morphogenesis from invertebrates to humans, where it promotes both attractive and repulsive motility.
However, whether netrin-1 functions as a soluble, chemotactic cue and/or as an adhesive, haptotactic cue
remains under debate. This is significant, as chemotactic cues can guide over long distances, whereas
haptotactic cues guide locally, and thus they achieve appropriate development via fundamentally distinct means.
We recently established protocols to separate and purify two distinctly glycosylated forms of netrin-1; we found
that one of these forms functions as an attractive haptotactic cue; the other acts as a chemotactic guidance cue
that elicits concentration-dependent attractive or repulsive responses. Here we will molecularly characterize
these different forms of netrin-1 with glycoanalytics. We will examine how differentially glycosylated forms of
netrin-1 evoke diverse responses during haptotaxis and chemotaxis, with the ultimate goal of developing novel
mouse models to manipulation netrin glycosylation and thus solubility in vivo. We use biochemical assays and
develop a novel tension sensor in the netrin receptor DCC to investigate how different presentations of netrin-1
alter signal transduction and mechanotransduction, respectively."
10857184,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is substantial evidence that hypertensive glaucoma dramatically alters the capacity of trabecular
meshwork (TM) cells to cope with mechanical stress, which in turn contributes to impaired drainage of aqueous
humor from the anterior eye. Functional loss is associated with stiffening of TM cells and their matrix, and with
loss of homeostatic mechanosensing that adjusts the resistance of the outflow pathway to the intensity of
experienced pressure and dynamics of aqueous humor flow. Fibrotic remodeling that underlies the increase in
flow resistance can be caused by chronic elevations in intraocular pressure (IOP) or by the cytokine TGF which
induces it in the absence of mechanical stress. There are currently no conceptual tools to link IOP stress, stages
of TM damage, TGF modulation and mechanotransduction in healthy and glaucomatous eyes into a unified
coherent mechanistic model.
The goal of this competing renewal is to test hypotheses about how TM cells navigate their response to pressure,
shear, and strain, how these mechanisms are reorganized in glaucoma and how matrix stiffness and TGF act
through mechanosensitive channels to serve as triggers for fibrotic remodeling that leads to functional loss in
glaucoma. Aim 1 will establish the roles of TRPV4 and Piezo1 channels in IOP regulation in conditional knockout
mouse models and ex vivo studies of conventional outflow. Aim 2 investigates the molecular foundation of
abnormal mechanotransduction in glaucomatous TM cells, studies the role of extracellular matrix as a central
determinant of mechanosensitivity, dissects the paradoxical dissonance between TRPV4 gene/protein
expression and function, and tests hypotheses about involvement of mechanochannels in intracellular stress
signaling, contractility, epithelial mesenchymal transition and regulation of cells’ proliferative potential. The goal
of Aim 3 is to bring together mechanotransduction and TGF signaling into a unified framework that would
accounts for biophysical (mechanical) and biochemical induction of many types of glaucoma. Upon completion
of the study we hope to expand our understanding of the complexity of interlocked molecular mechanisms
through which the TM regulates outflow facility, define the molecular triggers through which glaucoma hijacks
homeostatic force sensing by mechanosensitive ion channels, integrins and the cytoskeleton, and identify
strategies to mitigate injury by restoring the cells ability to autoregulate the mechanoresponse."
10834247,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Compared to peers in other racial groups, Black emerging adults (18-28 years old) have the highest risks of
short sleep duration and obesity. This increased risk may be partly explained by greater stress levels resulting
from race-related stress (feelings of discrimination and heightened vigilance) and living in more disadvantaged
home and neighborhood environments. Insufficient sleep (longer sleep-onset latency, shorter sleep duration,
poorer sleep quality and efficiency, less slow-wave sleep, and more severe sleep-disordered breathing) may
also impact obesity risk via several weight-related mechanisms. These include (a) energy balance (difference
between energy intake and energy expenditure), (b) appetite and food reward, (c) cortisol awakening response
and diurnal cortisol profiles, and (d) hydration status. We will prospectively assess effects of insufficient sleep,
race-related stress and living in more disadvantaged home and neighborhood environments on weight-related
mechanisms and obesity markers (body weight, waist circumference and fat mass) in 150 Black emerging adults.
Participants will complete 3, 7-day data collection bursts over 1 year (baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-
up). Insufficient sleep variables will be measured with 3 methods: sleep diary, actigraphy and polysomnography.
Self-report and objective methods will be used to assess weight-related mechanisms. Race-related stress will
be self-reported. Home and neighborhood environments (via the Windshield Survey) will be observer-assessed.
Aim 1 will examine prospective effects of insufficient sleep on weight-related mechanisms and obesity markers.
Aim 2 will examine prospective effects of race-related stress and living in more disadvantaged home and
neighborhood environments on insufficient sleep variables, weight-related mechanisms, and obesity markers.
Aim 3 will assess the mediating role of sleep on associations among race-related stress, living in more
disadvantaged home and neighborhood environments, weight-related mechanisms, and obesity markers. Our
overarching hypothesis is that higher amounts of insufficient sleep and race-related stress and living in more
disadvantaged home and neighborhood environments will be associated with (a) greatest energy intake and
positive energy balance, (b) greatest appetite and food reward, (c) flattest diurnal cortisol profiles and lowest
cortisol awakening response, (d) lowest hydration, and (e) greatest weight gain, waist circumference and fat
mass at 1 year. This proposal, led by an Early-Stage Investigator and submitted in response to PAR-20-164
(Mechanisms and Consequences of Sleep Disparities in the U.S.), could have significant public health
implications by identifying how and why insufficient sleep increases obesity risk in Black emerging adults."

The education of K-12 students and their recruitment and retention into STEM and biomedical careers remain
a national problem. SciTrek, a successful outreach program run from the University of California at Santa
Barbara, takes a unique approach to STEM education. Reaching ~3000 2nd-8th grade students yearly since
2010, SciTrek’s core philosophy is to immerse students in the practice of STEM, meant as a way of doing and
a way of thinking. SciTrek students investigate questions prompted by an observation presented to them by a
lead (teacher, SciTrek personnel) and four-six university volunteers/mentors, trained in the SciTrek method.
This is the start of a journey of discovery where student groups are not passive spectators, but are given full
ownership of the project. They formulate “testable questions,” and decide on an experimental plan,
implemented over several days. K-12 grade groups present evidence-based claims based on data analysis,
fostering student numeracy. Students present posters, discuss their findings, and provide an argument for their
conclusions promoting critical thinking and writing skills. SciTrek’s diverse volunteers contribute to
development of a “self as scientist” belief in diverse students.
 In this proposal, we seek to expand SciTrek, both to new schools, as well as partner institutions (Aims 1
and 3) with the overarching goal of altering the attrition of under-represented minorities (URMs) and girls from
STEM. Recent research suggests that beyond a lack of understanding of science and engineering practices,
attitudes developed in elementary school negatively impact the pipeline of students who choose STEM and
biomedical careers. Understanding how these beliefs (interest, identity, possible/plausible self) arise and may
be shaped is particularly relevant for retaining URMs and girls. SciTrek works within the current organizational
structures to promote NGSS-aligned science pedagogy. Using SciTrek’s multilevel approach of (1) inquiry-
based NGSS-aligned science experimentation focused on Science and Engineering Practices (2) four-six
university volunteers/mentors in each classroom, and (3) teacher professional development we aim to: a)
increase students’ understanding of what scientists do, and how knowledge is created, b) positively affect
students’ attitudes towards and interest in science, as well as science identities, and c) maintain students’
interest in STEM careers."
10906825,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of disability. Identifying modifiable mechanisms of poor knee joint health
development for disease prevention strategies are critical to improving long-term health. Aberrant mechanical
loading has been theorized as a primary risk factor for knee OA. Most studies primarily focus on mechanical
mechanisms of excessive joint loading in OA development. However, recent evidence suggests that joint
underloading may also play a role. The effects of low loading frequency assessed via daily steps in real world
settings on knee joint health is an understudied parameter of aberrant mechanical loading in individuals at risk
for OA. Individuals with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury who undergo ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgery
are a representative population to assess the effects of low loading frequency on knee joint health because they
are at elevated risk for posttraumatic OA development and demonstrate low daily steps compared to uninjured
individuals. Therefore, the overall study objective is to determine the mechanistic links between joint loading
frequency and comprehensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of knee joint cartilage health in
individuals post-ACLR. The central hypothesis is that individuals post-ACLR who take low daily steps will
demonstrate deconditioned, less resilient cartilage characterized by poor tibiofemoral cartilage composition and
greater cartilage strain which represent equally important, but independent measures of cartilage health.
Furthermore, increasing daily steps using a 16-week daily step promotion paradigm in individuals post-ACLR
who underload (<7000 daily steps which is predictive of physical inactivity) will recondition cartilage by improving
tibiofemoral cartilage composition and strain. The proposed study aims to determine: 1) associations between
daily steps with tibiofemoral cartilage composition and strain in ACLR individuals (n=56) using an observational
cross-sectional study design, and 2) the effects of increasing daily steps over 16-weeks on tibiofemoral cartilage
composition and strain in ACLR individuals with low daily steps (n=28) using a single arm, longitudinal pre-test
post-test study design. The proposed study is innovative because it builds on observational studies linking
underloading with poor knee joint health and will be the first study to mechanistically determine how altering
loading frequency (i.e., increasing daily steps) affects comprehensive in vivo measures of cartilage health in
individuals at risk for OA. Successful completion of the proposed study will provide foundational evidence for the
development of a future randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of an adaptive daily step promotion
intervention to reduce the risk of OA development in high-risk individuals. The proposed K01 Career
Development Award will provide the investigator with protected time to advance analysis and interpretation of
MRI measures of cartilage biology and mechanics as well as develop skills in clinical trial implementation. The
comprehensive training plan is vital to the investigator’s long-term career development in establishing an
independent research line to develop novel interventions for OA prevention and promote long-term quality of life."
10771298,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An effective malaria vaccine would be transformative for malaria elimination campaigns. A major challenge to
malaria vaccine development is that most immunogenic parasite antigens also exhibit extremely high
polymorphism. As a consequence, monovalent vaccines have lower efficacy against mismatched variants due
to imperfect cross-protective immunity. Additionally, signatures of naturally-acquired protective immunity, which
inform vaccine design, are not clearly legible in most field studies, where the background of parasite diversity
and accumulated lifetime exposure can bury functional responses among biomarkers of exposure.
Understanding how natural exposure to protein variants confers protection is essential for designing vaccines
that can overcome parasite diversity and provide robust protection. Additionally, linking infections with parasites
harboring variant haplotypes to subsequent immune responses against those specific variant epitopes would
support this conclusion and could identify cross-reactivity or cross-protection patterns and inform multivalent
vaccine target screening and design. Parallel analysis of parasite antigenic variation and variant-specific host
antibody responses in a multi-year longitudinal study of a consistent cohort offers an unprecedented opportunity
to triangulate variant positions and epitopes within polymorphic malaria antigens that contribute to protective
immunity. I will leverage densely-sampled longitudinal parasite genotype data (36 months of observation in over
500 participants) and samples collected as part of an ongoing, NIH-funded cohort study and combine this rich
sampling structure with high-dimensional serological measurements, molecular epidemiology, and data science
to develop in silico approaches for epitope screening. Specifically, I will: (1) correlate protective clinical reinfection
phenotypes with P. falciparum CSP C-terminal amino acid positions and epitopes in silico, (2) compare
cumulative parasite haplotype exposure profiles to position- and epitope-specific seroreactivity against field-
derived CSP sequences, and (3) measure and compare protection conferred by non-CSP antigen candidates
and variants in a naturally-exposed population. Upon completion of these aims, I will have developed new data
science-driven approaches for screening polymorphic antigens for epitopes and vaccine targets, which could
inform rational vaccine design for malaria elimination campaigns. The proposed work builds upon the PI’s
strengths in malaria molecular epidemiology and serology and serves as a bridge to in silico vaccinology. It builds
on existing collaborations, resources, and a supportive institutional environment. The proposed projects and
career development plan offer extensive training opportunities in epidemiology, immunology, informatics, and
translational research, which will position the PI to launch an independent career aimed at reducing the burden
of malaria and training the next generation of scientists at the intersection of sero- and molecular epidemiology,
bioanalytical chemistry, and data science."
10812472,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Coordination of cell behaviors is essential for growth in embryonic and juvenile animals, as well as during
regeneration of tissue lost by damage or disease. This is particularly challenging for stratified tissues, such as
skin, during rapid phases of growth in embryonic development and adult regeneration. Here, multiple cell layers
would have to communicate effectively and grow together to ensure stratification remains unaffected. How skin
cell layers behave and coordinate their growth when challenged with rapid expansion requires research
attention but has been limited by the availability of tools and platforms for quantitative live imaging. In
preliminary studies, we have developed tools to visualize and manipulate cell behaviors and signaling in
embryonic zebrafish epidermis, as well as a platform to perform quantitative live imaging of adult epidermis
during regeneration. To understand the mechanism of coordination between epidermal layers, we will: 1) test
the role of tissue tension and MAPK mediated mechanochemical feedback in regulating growth of embryonic
epidermis during axial elongation and 2) test the role of tissue geometry in coordinating epidermis growth
during adult regeneration following scale plucking and corneal abrasion. This comprehensive analysis of skin
growth during development and regeneration of complex tissues will inform strategies for control of repair in
human conditions of tissue damage or disease.
The project draws on 1) my previous training in cell and developmental biology, 2) live imaging technique I
have established to perform in toto imaging of embryonic and adult zebrafish tissues, 3) the quantitative skill
set I will acquire during my training to analyze this data and 4) training on spatial transcriptomics to define
signaling pathways activated during regeneration. For successful completion of these aims, I have assembled
a mentoring committee – Dr. Stefano Di Talia and Dr. Kenneth Poss, whose combined expertise in quantitative
biology, zebrafish genetics and regeneration biology will train me to become an expert on these topics. In
addition, the advice and input I will receive from my collaborators – Dr. Christoph Schmidt, Dr. Terry Lechler
and Dr. Brigid Hogan - on tissue mechanics, epithelial and skin biology and career development will further my
ability to achieve the goals of this project and help launch my independent research career. I am confident that
the additional training I will receive during this award will help me achieve my long-term goal of establishing a
high-quality research group as an independent investigator"

Human genetic studies have identified hundreds of genes contributing to Neuropsychiatric and Neurodevelop-
mental Disease (NPD) risk. But for most genes, their normal function or the consequences of their absence or
reduction on neurodevelopment and neural function are not known. Here, we propose to address the substantial
challenges of discerning potential functions of hundreds of NPD genes through the development of a High
Throughput Neuropsychiatric Disease Phenotyping Center (UCLA HT-NPC), driven by the activity of 9 highly
collaborative investigators (Aharoni, Bhaduri, Damoiseaux, Geschwind, Golshani, Kitai, Luo, Novich, and Wells)
and two substantial core facilities (UCLA Molecular Screening Shared Resource and the Human Stem Cell and
Genome Engineering Center). Through a tiered approach, we combine high throughput and high value,
quantitative phenotyping with stem cell engineering to characterize the functional consequences of NPD gene
knockouts (null alleles), a key initial step that will inform our understanding of disease pathways. In the first step,
we will rapidly generate null alleles for 250 genes chosen by the Consortium using a rapid, high throughput
lentiviral based system in hESCs. Viability and neural induction potential will be assessed, and quantitative
phenotyping conducted using RNA-seq on all lines. Those genes passing viability and neural induction tests will
be used in the production of clonal null hiPSC lines (male and female) for downstream phenotyping and wider
distribution to the community. Subsequently, we will perform high throughput, quantitative, multi-scale
phenotyping at the molecular, morphological, and physiological levels in both 2D and 3D hiPSC-based models
of human cortical development. We leverage the relative strengths and scalability of each model to enable us to
perform both snRNA and bulk RNA-seq, measure the maturation, morphology, and synaptic density of neural
cells using automated imaging, including the multiplexed, protein-based CODEX (Phenocycler) platform, and
characterize neuronal activity and synchronization through optical recordings using custom-built mini-scope
arrays (STIMscope). By using multiple systems (e.g. hESC/hiPSC; gene editing, 2D and 3D cultures), we test
biological reproducibility across systems and technical reproducibility through replication. The use of
experimentally validated, quantitative phenotypes across multiple scales of analysis facilitates data sharing and
comparisons with other SSPsyGene investigators and provides a template for the field more broadly."
10841637,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Advances in sequencing technologies provide new opportunities to interrogate biological systems from multiple
perspectives. However, the introduction of new technologies highlights a problem many researchers face:
missing data. Missing observations across technologies and biological states is a frequently observed problem
in the field of computational biology. This missingness can be a result of limitations in the technology, the rarity
of a biological state, or because the technology has not been widely adopted. While one technology may have
high sparsity in biological observations, there is an opportunity to leverage existing, complementary data from
an established technology to impute the missing biological observations.
We address these issues by utilizing new methodological advances in machine learning, primarily focusing on
domain adaptation techniques. These techniques learn patterns in one dataset that can be adapted to another
dataset, enabling cross-technology information sharing. Our proposal introduces a general framework in which
domain adaptation techniques can be used to unite an emerging technology with a different, but technology. To
highlight the broad utility of this approach, we apply this model to three biomedical applications: 1) Predict
cell-type-specific perturbation response in rheumatoid arthritis; 2) Predict tissue-of-origin from cell-free DNA
(cfDNA); 3) Predict progenitor-specific gene signatures from cell-free DNA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
The proposed aims not only unite existing and emerging sequencing technologies, but enable the discovery of
new biology that is difficult or infeasible to directly observe.
The research proposed builds on my experience in using statistical approaches for transcriptomic data. During
the K99 phase I will require further training from my mentoring team in deep generative modeling (Dr. Casey
Greene), modeling of single-cell data (Dr. Fan Zhang), and modeling of cfDNA and chromatin accessibility (Dr.
Srinivas Ramachandran). The research will be conducted at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical
Campus, in the Center for Health AI. In this institution, I will have access to the Colorado Clinical and
Translational Sciences Institute and the RNA Bioscience Initiative, which provide resources for building an
interdisciplinary and translational research program. With this training and available institutional resources, I
will have a solid foundation on which to build an independent research program focused on domain adaptation
applications for high-throughput sequencing technologies."
10845709,"Young pregnancy and the behaviors that lead to it—penile-vaginal sexual intercourse and contraceptive
non-use—have important long-term consequences for health and well-being. Religiosity plays an important
role in these behaviors; more than half of U.S. states require that sex education curricula include an emphasis
on abstinence, a faith-based approach to avoiding undesired pregnancy.
 We propose to build on existing research using cross-sectional and large-interval longitudinal datasets,
which have dramatically advanced our understanding of how religious and non-religious youth differ in terms
of overall pregnancy rates and related behaviors, but do not include detailed measures of the dynamic
behaviors that lead to pregnancy. We will use the only available population-based dataset with repeated weekly
measures of penile-vaginal sex and contraceptive behaviors and the intimate relationships in which they occur,
combined with detailed questions about religious affiliation, beliefs, and behaviors. The questions about
religion permit us to construct three distinct measures of religiosity across three domains: religious
conservatism (affiliation with a conservative denomination, belief that the bible is the inerrant word of God),
external religiosity (service attendance), and internal religiosity (praying, religious salience).
 We propose to estimate differences across these domains of religiosity in terms of an integrated set of
sexual and contraceptive behaviors throughout the study period—time spent in an intimate partnership, time
to first penile-vaginal intercourse within each intimate relationship, frequency of penile-vaginal intercourse
after a relationship became sexual, whether any contraceptive method was used during each week that included
penile-vaginal intercourse, whether a hormonal (vs. coital) method was used during each week of contraceptive
use, whether a condom was used consistently (during each act of penile-vaginal intercourse) during weeks of
condom use, and whether the male partner consistently withdrew the penis before ejaculation during each
week withdrawal was used. We will also analyze pregnancy rates and undesired pregnancy rates and estimate
the extent to which differences by religiosity are due to differences in penile-vaginal sexual behavior,
differences in contraceptive use, or both. The combined detail of these analyses is unprecedented and will allow
us to distinguish among multiple mechanisms through which religiosity influences behavior, such as
conservative values about pre-marital sex, fear of pregnancy, lack of planning for penile-vaginal intercourse,
beliefs about the beginning of life, social exposure, social interaction, and social control.
 We propose the ideal collaborative research team for these analyses. Barber was the PI of the original
RDSL project, and Pearce designed the religiosity measures in the RDSL baseline survey. Their complementary
expertise—Barber’s in intimate relationships, sexual behavior, and contraceptive use, and Pearce’s in religion
and religiosity among youth—are ideal for the proposed project."

Mother own milk (MOM) provides personalized risk reduction for neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants,
but little is known about insufficient MOM in 84% of NICU mothers with non-very low birthweight infants,
leaving a major research gap that disproportionately impacts Black NICU mother-infant dyads. Insufficient
MOM volume has its origins in late pregnancy and postpartum days 1-14. The goal of this research is to
determine the effect of GA on lactation outcomes among pump-dependent mothers of critically ill infants
admitted to the NICU. A major lack of knowledge exists about the effect of mammary gland maturation on
MOM volume, secretory activation (SA), and if/how it is mediated by MOM removal (e.g., breast pump use)
during the critical window (postpartum days 1-14) of transition from secretory differentiation (epithelial cell
preparation) to SA (onset of copious MOM volume) and autocrine control of lactation (permanence of SA) to
ensure continued production of adequate MOM volume. To fill this gap, this revised mentored patient-oriented
research career development award (K23) proposed study will follow 188 racially and economically diverse
mothers of infants admitted to the NICU for postpartum days 1-14 and assigned to 1 of 4 groups based on the
infant's GA at delivery. Aim 1 will compare measures of MOM volume between the GA groups over postpartum
days 1-14. Aim 2 will compare measures of onset and permanence of SA using MOM biomarkers between the
GA groups. Aim 3 is exploratory to gain evidence to characterize the relationship between biomarkers and
MOM volume for the 4 GA groups. Understanding of these mechanisms and the impact of GA is critical to
translate findings into early identification and personalized interventions for this vulnerable population. To this
end, I have assembled an interdisciplinary team of senior scientists with complementary expertise in nutritional
support for critically ill infants, clinical and translational research, biostatistics, and lactation biology who will
provide mentorship to achieve the proposed training goals and facilitate my transition to an independent
research career. Essential primary training goals include: 1) Advance understanding of the biology of lactation,
maternal, and infant factors; 2) Develop and apply knowledge of the application of clinical and experimental
designs, data acquisition, data analysis, and interpretation of findings; and 3) Develop leadership, research
management, academic faculty, and grant writing skills essential for a productive research faculty member.
University of Florida (UF), Shands Children's Hospital, and UF Diary Science are ideal environments to provide
unparalleled resources to support and extend the PI's emerging translational clinical research to become a
productive faculty member and independent researcher in patient-oriented research. The revised research plan
is directly responsive to the reviewer comments and to the National Institute of Nursing Research's priorities
focused on research using multilevel approaches bridging biology to society reducing risk, improving health,
and advancing health equity, as well as aligns with NIH initiatives to prioritize human milk research."

a data portal for the scientiﬁc community. We have assembled a team of investigators, bioinformatics scientists,
data curators, and software developers with a strong track record in mosaic variant analysis, long-read data
analysis, data portal development, visualization, large-scale data management and computing, and development
of secure and ﬂexible cloud technologies. In Aim 1, we will work with the Network members to deﬁne data and
metadata standards and ensure that high-quality data are generated, processed, and annotated uniformly and
efﬁciently. In Aim 2, we will perform benchmark studies for the current tools and technologies for identiﬁcation
of mosaic variants and lead an effort to deﬁne and implement analytical pipelines on a cloud platform. We will
also develop new approaches as needed. We will ensure that a comprehensive set of mosaic variants of all types
(single nucleotide variants, indels, copy number variants, translocations, complex rearrangements, transposable
element insertions, microsatellite mutations, repeat expansions, etc.) are identiﬁed, using short- and long-read
platforms, genome-wide and targeted assays, and bulk and single cell technologies. In Aim 3, we will build a
user-friendly and interactive data portal containing a variant catalog and featuring a read-level variant browser to
enable the scientiﬁc community to fully utilize the Network data. We will ensure that all methods and processes
are documented for full reproducibility and that all tools and data are freely available to the community.

The survival of advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) remains dismal due in part to the
complex tumor–immune microenvironment (TIME). The presence of tumor-infiltrating T cells correlates with
improved patient outcome in advanced EOC, yet checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has generally shown
poor efficacy against EOC in clinical trials. A major challenge is the low number of T cells compared to EOC
cells in the tumor that establish an immune-suppressive TIME. Tumor-targeted, cell-activatable
photoimmunotherapy (taPIT, a near infrared phototherapy) may provide an alternative treatment approach that
selectively destroys EOC cells expressing cell-surface epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while
enhancing the preservation of tumor infiltrating immune cells salient to an adaptive immune response (e.g.,
local cytotoxic T cells and dendritic cells). While photoimmunotherapy is not new, this is the first exploration of
taPIT dose fractionation to selective eradicate EOC while stimulating immune cells at lower doses and
preferentially sparing immune cells at higher doses. Based on our rich preliminary data, we propose that
mathematical modeling-informed taPIT serves as a new paradigm for combined cytotoxic therapy and
immunotherapy in metastatic EOC. Our overall goal is a novel experimental, simulation- and image-guided
approach for utilizing the local selectivity of taPIT to prime “cold” TIME’s for immune checkpoint inhibition. This
proposal contributes an innovative physical sciences approach to cancer therapy integrating mathematical
modeling with a 3D culture model of the TIME and in vivo imaging experiments in immunocompetent mouse
models of EOC, including in silico immuno-oncology modeling to optimize TIME composition-specific therapy;
fractionated taPIT dosimetry to reduce the EOC cell burden relative to effector T cells and dendritic cells within
the TIME; and, in vivo multiplexed fluorescence microendoscopy to interrogate the TIME of metastatic EOC
within the peritoneal cavity. The unique ability to image micronodular disease will enable parameterizing a
mathematical model with pre-treatment conditions and dynamic in vivo responses to therapy as a basis for the
quantitative design of custom-tailored therapies. Our aims are (1) to train an in silico model by correlating
clinical pre-treatment EOC TIME compositions with pathological anti-PD1 response; (2) to derive optimal
fractionated taPIT protocols that shift “cold” to anti-PD1-sensitive “hot” TIME in vitro, and (3) to prime the TIME
for anti-PD1 therapy in vivo. The concepts introduced here will ultimately enable taPIT–anti-PD1 therapy
dosimetry that synergistically stimulates both local and distal immune-enhancing effects to impact disease sites
missed by near infrared light, in combination with frontline surgical tumor debulking and systemic
chemotherapy. The approaches developed here are translatable to other tumor sites that can be treated with
taPIT, including head and neck cancers, skin cancers, and lung cancers."

 Dr. Mahsa Abassi is an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the
University of Minnesota. Over the past six years, she has been engaged in clinical research, focusing on HIV-
related neuroinfections in Uganda. Her long-term objective is to become an independent clinical researcher
with an emphasis on improving outcomes in neuroinfections. Her career development plan proposes mentored
training in: 1) neurologic techniques (EEGs, neuroradiology, and neurocognitive assessment), 2) laboratory
techniques related to metabolomics applications, and 4) biostatistics with an emphasis of analyzing
metabolites in biologic samples.
 Research: Cryptococcal meningitis accounts for 15% of HIV/AIDS-related deaths globally and is the most
common cause of adult meningitis in Africa. Altered mental status (ranging from delirium to coma) at the time
of cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis is consistently an independent predictor of increased mortality. Despite
repeated studies confirming this strong association between altered mental status and death, there is a
fundamental lack of understanding into the exact neurological abnormalities leading to acute altered mental
status, its contributions to increased mortality, and the best practices for management.
 The objective of this proposal is to identify the neurological abnormalities that contribute to altered mental
status and to understand how this contributes to increased cryptococcal mortality. The overarching hypothesis
is that cryptococcal meningitis with its increased intracranial pressure leads to cerebral hypoxia, abnormal
electrical activity, and biochemical changes in the central nervous system (CNS) that can be detected through
brain metabolite CSF analysis and enhanced clinical monitoring with cerebral oximetry and EEGs. This
proposal aims to: 1) determine if HIV-infected persons with cryptococcal meningitis presenting with altered
mental status (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) <15) at diagnosis have measurable underlying neurological
abnormalities and impairments in cerebral energy metabolism (i.e. insufficient oxidative metabolism) as
compared to persons with normal mental status (GCS=15); and 2) determine if implementation of standardized
clinical interventions can reverse neurological abnormalities and improve cerebral energy metabolism within 3
days of diagnosis, and reduce 30-day mortality in HIV-infected persons with cryptococcal meningitis presenting
with altered mental status (GCS<15). Results of the above aims will shed light into previously unknown
pathophysiologic mechanisms that lead to altered mental status in cryptococcal meningitis. The training in
neuroinfections, metabolomics applications, and biostatistics that Dr. Abassi will obtain will inform future
proposals dedicated to understanding the neuropathology of various neuroinfections and finding evidence-
based interventions dedicated to improving survival."
10888283,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Iatrogenic withdrawal affects up to 57% of children who receive sedative and analgesic medications in the
pediatric intensive care unit (ICU), contributing to delayed recovery, patient and parental distress and
prolonged hospitalization in (an estimated) 70,000 children per year. Due to limitations in sample size and
variable sets, studies on iatrogenic withdrawal in pediatric ICUs have primarily focused on the association of
single risk factors, screening tools, and treatment regimens, without attention to early identification of at-risk
children. This proposal will leverage a national, electronic health record derived database of over 200,000
pediatric ICU patients to investigate the full spectrum of risk factors, patient profiles, and practice patterns
associated with iatrogenic withdrawal from sedatives and analgesic medications that could identify children at
risk prior to withdrawal symptoms or early in their treatment course. I will achieve this by first identifying risk
factors, patient profiles and practice patterns associated with iatrogenic withdrawal using traditional
biostatistical techniques. Second, I will use the identified risk factors in addition to time dependent variables,
such as vital signs and laboratory values, to develop a dynamic model to predict risk of developing iatrogenic
withdrawal in pediatric ICU patients using novel supervised machine learning methodology. Third, I will
externally validate the dynamic prediction model in a local dataset from my institution’s electronic health record
to determine if the model can accurately predict those patients who develop clinically confirmed iatrogenic
withdrawal. Successful completion of these aims will lead to the development of an analytical tool to identify
iatrogenic withdrawal in children in ICUs using electronic-based resources which can be operationalized into
clinical practice. The proposed studies are feasible because of 1) my strong and productive multi-disciplinary
team of clinician and data science mentors who meet biweekly under the guidance of my mentorship team
including Dr. Murray Pollack, a leader in the field of predictive modelling in pediatric critical care and Dr.
Michael Bell, a national leader in neurocritical care, and 2) the recent availability of reliable, large, multi-
institutional pediatric databases derived directly from the electronic health record (EHR). This K23 award
proposal will also facilitate an integrated didactic and mentor-led experiential training program designed to
develop and refine my knowledge and skills in big database research, predictive modelling, and morbidity
associated with sedative and analgesic medication administration. The career development and research
proposal will enable my long-term career goal, which is to become an independently funded clinical
investigator focused on the prevention of healthcare-acquired morbidity through big data research and
predictive analytics."

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, and a major source of chronic pain. No disease-
modifying OA drugs are available to patients, and current analgesic approaches fall short of patients’ needs.
Nerve growth factor (NGF) has emerged as a promising target for OA pain. Neutralizing antibodies that prevent
NGF from binding to its receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), have shown strong analgesic effects in
clinical trials for OA pain. However, up to 10% of patients treated with anti-NGF developed rapidly progressive
OA, necessitating joint replacement. The mechanism of this deleterious effect of NGF blockade on joint
integrity is unknown, exposing our ongoing lack of understanding the relationship between joint damage and
pain in OA. During the previous funding cycles, we have developed assays, reporter mice, and
neuroanatomical and biophysical techniques for monitoring neuronal activity in vivo to assess pain behaviors
and underlying neurobiological mechanisms in mouse models of OA. We have uncovered that joint damage in
OA is accompanied by extensive anatomical and functional neuronal plasticity of the nociceptive innervation of
the knee. We will build on this discovery to test the central hypothesis that the NGF-TrkA axis is essential for
the preservation of joint homeostasis in response to joint injury, through neuronal and non-neuronal
mechanisms. We will (Aim 1) Determine the spatial and temporal NGF-TrkA “interactome” in the joint. Using
reporter mice, single cell RNAseq of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), RNAscope, and immunohistochemistry, we
will detail which cells in the knee and DRG express Ngf and Ntrk1 during progressive experimental OA, in
spatiotemporal relationship to neuronal plasticity and joint pathology. We will validate findings in human knee
tissues; (Aim 2) Determine the role of the NGF-TrkA axis in promoting neuronal growth in the OA joint, and
how this contributes to pain and joint integrity. We will assess if NGF causes neuroplasticity, by injecting it into
knees of NaV1.8 reporter mice and assess pain behaviors, joint innervation, and joint integrity (histology and
microCT), as well as functional effects on sensory neurons. Advillin-creERT2 mice will be used to delete Nrtrk1
from sensory neurons in adult mice subjected to DMM or PMX surgery; pain, neuroplasticity, and joint damage
will be assessed up to 16 weeks; (Aim 3) Explore the role of the NGF-TrkA axis in OA through non-neuronal
mechanisms. We will use Ngf-loxp and Ntrk1-loxp mice to conditionally delete Ngf or Ntrka from select non-
neuronal cells (myeloid cells, osteoblasts, or chondrocytes). Mice will be subjected to surgery, and OA
monitored up to week 8; (Aim 4) Assess the effect of anti-NGF Abs on the OA joint. The role of the NGF-TrkA
axis in the whole joint as an organ will be determined by using neutralizing anti-NGF antibodies, either
prophylactically (0-8 and 0-16 weeks) or therapeutically (8-16 weeks) after surgery. This approach will clarify
how the NGF-TrkA axis operates at the interface between pain and joint damage in OA. Our experiments will
also start to address if and how the pain-producing and homeostatic actions of this axis can be dissociated, in
order to identify new targets for OA pain."

Hypertension affects more than 80% of adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and its treatment is a
cornerstone of CKD management. Clinical guidelines vary in their recommendations for blood pressure targets
in CKD, reflecting uncertainties in the interpretation of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)
and its extrapolation to adults with CKD, particularly those with advanced CKD. Although evidence from
randomized trials has strong internal validity, it may not reflect the risk benefit profile of patient populations that
will receive treatment in practice. Our overarching goal is to evaluate the comparative risks and benefits of
intensive versus standard blood pressure targets in real world adults with CKD. Our secondary goal is to
demonstrate the feasibility and utility of novel analytical approaches that extend causal effects from
randomized trial effects to broader populations. We will accomplish these goals by leveraging electronic health
record data from two large health care systems encompassing 13 million enrollees - the Veterans Health
Administration and Kaiser Permanente of Southern California. To inform our real-world estimates, we will
integrate individual-level data from four diverse hypertension trials on 20,000 participants. In Aim 1, we will
estimate average treatment effects of intensive versus standard blood pressure targets among SPRINT-eligible
real world adults with CKD. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate models for individualized prediction of
intensive blood pressure treatment effects, and illustrate the application in real world CKD populations. In Aim
3, we will emulate a sequential clinical trial of blood pressure medication intensification using electronic health
records in persons with CKD. Our study is important because hypertension treatment affects nearly all adults
with CKD and key evidence gaps may lead to suboptimal management in this high-risk population. It is
innovative because it will provide new evidence about the implications of intensive blood pressure targets and
new analytic approaches to support clinical decisions with real world data."
10877854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a global crisis facing the aging population and society as a whole. Despite studies
suggesting that blacks may be at greater risk of developing AD, with 2-3 times higher prevalence rate of cognitive
impairment than whites, there have been few studies investigating health disparities, and blacks have been
underrepresented in many prominent U.S. AD biomarker studies and clinical trials. The current biomarker
classification system (i.e., the ATN model) does not fully account for health disparities and can’t explain the
increased prevalence among blacks of both AD and vascular risk factors for AD such as diabetes and
hypertension when compared to whites. Research on cognitive aging has traditionally focused on how decline
in various cortical and hippocampal regions influences cognition. However, tau pathology emerges decades
before amyloid pathology, appearing first in the brainstem; particularly in the locus coeruleus (LC), the source of
brain’s norepinephrine (NE). Our decade-long studies in humans using a norepinephrine transporter (NET)-
selective radiotracer ([11C]MRB) have demonstrated a special vulnerability of LC to aging and stress. Our
preliminary data reveals that the decline rate of NET, normally associated with aging due to loss in NET
availability and cell death, is much faster among blacks starting in the mid-30s, particularly in black males (e.g.,
2-3%/yr vs. 0.14-0.23%/yr in thalamus and brainstem for black males vs. white males (p<0.00001)). As the LC
plays a central role in the integration and orchestration of the adaptive CNS response to various stressors or
challenges, we hypothesize that
cumulative exposure to socioeconomic disadvantage and racial discrimination
may cause long-lasting changes in LC function followed by LC neuronal loss, which would explain the different
AD phenotypical clinical presentation among blacks (i.e., less tau burden but more LC loss and vascular
damage). Our hypothesis is also supported by the broad evidence that the LC is an early site of AD
neurodegeneration and LC cell density is more strongly associated with cognitive decline than other nuclei. We
propose to test this hypothesis by demonstrating that there will be age and race/ethnic differences on NET
availability (measured with [11C]MRB) across midlife and late-life in the LC and its target brain regions (Aim 1),
and that decreased NET availability is associated with stress levels and impaired cognition (Aim 2), as well as
the predictive value of NET availability on longitudinal change in cognition (Aim 3). There is the potential to
determine if dysfunction of the LC is: i) a potential marker for the increased AD pathology that is observed in
normal aging; ii) a key contributor to the development of metabolic syndrome, vascular dysfunction, and cognitive
decline, as result of chronic stress; iii) associated with increased prevalence of both AD and vascular risk factors
for AD in blacks when compared to whites; iv) associated with everyday stress levels and cumulative stress
burden; v) a key mechanism that contributes to the health disparities in AD expression."
10866428,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The long-term objectives of our research program are to (i) discover novel bacterial natural products
(NPs), (ii) elucidate the biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms of these NPs, and (iii) characterize
and utilize the discovered NPs and their biosynthetic enzymes for biomedical and biotechnological applications.
NPs are highly functionalized and evolutionarily optimized small molecules that possess unrivaled chemical
and structural diversities, resulting in a wide range of biological activities. Terpenoids, the largest and most
structurally diverse family of NPs, are considered rare in bacteria; only ~1.2% of known terpenoids are of
bacterial origin. However, genomics studies revealed that the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for terpenoid
biosynthesis are widely distributed in bacteria, particularly actinobacteria. We hypothesize that (i) bacterial
terpenoids are considerably underestimated among current NP libraries and the discovery and characterization
of novel terpenoids will lead to new drug leads and (ii) understanding the sequence-structure-function
relationships of terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes will lead to new opportunities in genome mining, combinatorial
biosynthesis, and oxidative biocatalysis. Our initial efforts follow two research directions that address
immediate needs and will set the stage for continued success in the field of terpenoid discovery and
biosynthesis. In the first direction, we will use an integrated genomics–metabolomics approach to discovery
novel bacterial terpenoids from bacteria. This will include the development of new and innovative
methodologies for targeted identification of complex bacterial terpenoids and the activation or upregulation of
terpenoid biosynthetic gene clusters. In the second direction, we will elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of
both new and known bacterial terpenoids and functionally, mechanistically, and structurally characterize
terpene synthases and their associated oxidative enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450s. We will use a
rigorous multidisciplinary approach involving genome mining, bioinformatics analysis, in vivo pathway
engineering, (un)natural product isolation and structural determination, in vitro enzymology, and protein X-ray
crystallography. Our experience in terpenoid biosynthesis and enzymology and our significant progress in
both research directions supports the feasibility of the proposed research and that we are well-suited to
establish and sustain a successful independent program in this field. In addition, we have established several
key collaborations with leaders in the fields of synthetic biology, NP drug discovery, and X-ray
crystallography that further strengthen this research program. Expected outcomes of this research program
include the revelation of the bacterial terpenome, understanding the underlying principles of how terpene
synthases dictate terpene cyclization, and the exploitation of naturally evolved oxidative enzymes to create a
toolbox of biocatalysts."
10886792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although there is evidence that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be accurately identified during the second
year of life, and that early intervention can improve developmental outcomes, many children in the United States
are not diagnosed with ASD until much later. Families seeking ASD evaluation often face barriers such as low
availability of specialists, lengthy waitlists, and long distances to tertiary care diagnostic centers. This is
especially true for children from traditionally underserved groups and communities. Without an innovative
approach for prompt identification of ASD in young children, families and clinicians will continue to struggle with
accessing and providing care. Telemedicine offers tremendous potential for addressing this need. However,
there are few psychometrically sound, validated tools that can be administered remotely, via telehealth platforms,
in order to guide service and action. We recently developed and evaluated a novel parent-administered/clinician-
guided tele-assessment tool, the TAP (previously the TELE-ASD-PEDS; R21 MH118539). Initial successful
studies within a controlled laboratory context yielded very high levels of family satisfaction with the experience,
perceived utility by clinicians, and agreement regarding ASD risk classification with blinded comprehensive
evaluation. Although promising, this work was limited by its reliance on controlled laboratory settings, a relatively
small homogeneous sample, and use within a single research group. We have not yet validated the TAP for in-
home use in a broader community sample, with novel groups of diagnostic clinicians, nor have we adequately
demonstrated its value and impact for families representing traditionally underserved populations and areas. The
current proposal represents the first rigorous evaluation of a tele-assessment tool for ASD with a large, diverse
sample of children within their homes. In the current study, across two sites, we will recruit 360 toddlers (18-42
months) to participate in a home-based telemedicine evaluation using an ASD assessment tool explicitly
developed for this purpose (i.e., the TAP). The sample will include children from the community who have
screened positive on an ASD screener, as well as those referred from primary care and state early intervention
systems. We will randomize families to receive assessment based on telemedicine alone or telemedicine plus
an in-person evaluation, and then follow families over a 6-month time interval. This methodology will allow us to
conduct rigorous psychometric evaluation of the TAP and comparison to widely used diagnostic tests,
longitudinally evaluate service access and family engagement, and examine factors that affect diagnostic
decision-making and family outcomes. This work has potential to transform the ASD evaluation process and
dramatically improve access for traditionally underserved groups."
10666306,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol misuse negatively affects relationships and is significantly correlated with higher rates of relationship
conflict, distress, and dissolution as well as other serious negative interpersonal consequences (e.g., domestic
violence, sexual assaults). Encouragement from concerned partners (CPs) is a common motivator for those
who misuse alcohol to pursue care and often the most helpful mechanism in supporting change. The goals of
this proposal are to: Identify how specific CP behaviors influence their partner’s alcohol craving, motives,
drinking, and problems on a daily basis using dyadic ecological momentary assessment techniques (Aim 1);
use the knowledge from EMA analysis to iteratively develop a CP-focused web-based intervention (WBI) that
provides psychoeducation about communication patterns that influence DP drinking and by integrating
personalized feedback about CPs’ own communication behaviors that may be working against their goals (Aim
2); and pilot the WBI’s efficacy on CP outcomes (depression, anxiety, social support), their partner’s drinking
behavior (alcohol consumption, motives, related consequences), and both partners’ relationship distress and
conflict (Aim 3). We expect the WBI will yield significant improvements in all outcomes. This project is
significant because intervening with CPs has strong potential to change relationship dynamics that may reduce
problems and prevent future problems associated with alcohol misuse. It also develops a new prevention
model that does not rely on the drinking partner attending a clinical facility to access care. The proposed study
is innovative because it uses dyadic and ecological momentary assessment designs to test dynamic questions
about interdependence in relationship interactions and alcohol use between partners and employs the
generated knowledge to inform intervention adaptation. Teaching CPs to effectively communicate their
concerns may be a necessary catalyst for decreasing their partner’s alcohol use and preventing alcohol use
disorders. The potential reach of this intervention is large such that it can be easily implemented over the web
to those who may need help but would not otherwise seek care."
10895550,"Project Summary. Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with an estimated economic burden of more than
$160 billion per year in the US alone. To mitigate this burden, a promising approach involves the discovery of
novel treatment interventions targeting specific neuronal circuit dysfunction, especially early in the illness, thus
ameliorating the course of the disorder. In recent work, we found that the oscillatory activity of the dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), assessed with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and EEG, was markedly
reduced in chronic schizophrenia (Ch-SCZ) patients. DLPFC oscillatory deficits are also present in early course
(EC-SCZ) patients and are associated to their reduced working memory (WM) performance. But findings to date
are limited by a correlational/cross-sectional design, leaving the potential causal role of DLPFC oscillatory deficits
in SCZ cognitive dysfunction unclear. The overarching goal of this proposal is to establish whether, by acutely
enhancing DLPFC oscillatory activity, we see a corresponding improvement in WM function in EC-SCZ patients.
In addition to being used to assess cortical function, as in combination with EEG, TMS can be delivered in
repetitive, high-frequency patterns (rTMS), to modulate brain activity, including prefrontal cortical oscillations.
Theta Burst Stimulation (TBS) is a type of rTMS that induces more rapid effects on neural activity than
conventional rTMS; continuous TBS (cTBS) and intermittent TBS (iTBS) can decrease and enhance cortical
excitability, respectively. Recent studies have shown that iTBS of DLPFC can acutely enhance prefrontal
excitability in healthy individuals. Yet, the immediate impact of TBS on DLPFC oscillatory activity in patients with
SCZ remains unknown. The first broad Aim of this proposal is to use iTBS to acutely ameliorate deficits in DLPFC
oscillatory activity in EC-SCZ patients.
WM relies on a neural network in which DLPFC serves as a central hub. EEG studies have reported that SCZ
patients have DLPFC oscillatory abnormalities during WM tasks, and we recently found that reduced DLPFC
oscillatory activity predicts poorer WM performance in EC-SCZ patients. It therefore stands to reason that
enhancing DLPFC oscillatory activity with TBS may benefit cognitive functioning. The second broad Aim of this
proposal is to use iTBS to acutely ameliorate WM impairments in EC-SCZ patients.
To achieve these goals, we will perform TMS/EEG assessments of DLPFC oscillatory parameters and evaluate
WM ability before and after two TBS sessions (iTBS and sham TBS of DLPFC) in seventy-five EC-SCZ patients.
The proposed study aims to provide initial evidence that TBS can acutely enhance DLPFC oscillatory activity,
which in turn predicts better WM performance, in EC-SCZ patients. Building on these findings, future
neuromodulation-based treatment interventions applying chronic doses of TBS may more persistently
ameliorate/restore DLPFC oscillatory parameters and related WM impairments in SCZ patients early during the
illness, thus significantly improving their cognitive functioning and overall quality of life."
10840859,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background: Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal, dominant neurogenetic disorder caused by
polyglutamine repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HD gene encoding huntingtin (HTT). It is
estimated that 1−3 in every 10,000 persons (nearly 30,000 in the USA) have HD. Patients suffer
from progressive neurodegeneration in the basal ganglia and the cortex, leading to progressive
movement disorders and severe psychiatric disturbances. Although the disorder was described
over 100 years ago, effective treatments do not exist. Genome editing using the precise and
potent CRISPR-Cas9 system represents an exciting therapeutic approach to treat HD. The
proposed study will employ the CRISPR-Cas9 system delivered via novel engineered capsid of
adeno-associated-virus (AAV), AAV-LC.V1.
Objective: We propose to determine efficacy and safety of the dual AAV-LC.V1 genetic therapy
in the brain using animal models. The results of these studies are essential components for our
Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical
testing of our HD program.
Specific Aims: Aim 1 will focus on in vitro screening a pair of gRNAs for the most frequent mutant
human HTT gene haplotypes. These studies will test the efficacy of knocking down the mutant
HTT allele as well as off-target editing. Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of knocking down the
mutant HTT allele in two murine models of HD via AAV-CRISPR. The vectors will be injected by
convection-enhanced delivery directly into the mouse brain (striatum and thalamus). To assess
overall therapeutic benefit, efficiency of editing at the molecular level will be tested in collected
tissues, while assessment of rescue from an HD phenotype will be evaluated by a battery of
behavioral tests. Aim 3 will examine toxicity and biodistribution of different doses of our AAV-
CRISPR system in rats in a GLP-compliant setting as required for IND-enabling studies. Tissues
will be collected at 3- and 9-months for histopathological evaluation to prepare the required GLP
toxicology report. As required by the FDA, acute and long-term efficacy, safety, and biodistribution
of the two-AAV-CRISPR vector system will be also assessed in the brains of non-human primates
(Aim 4). Many proposed experiments will be performed by specialized preclinical CROs in a GLP-
compliant setting.
Impact: By demonstrating the safety and efficacy of AAV-LC.V1-CRISPR gene therapy, the
proposed suite of studies may lead to clinical testing of this system to treat the progressive
neurodegeneration associated with HD."
10842400,"PROJECT SUMMARY OVERALL
While the development of high-throughput sequencing technology and its application to clinical diagnostics has
yielded the genetic basis for many rare genetic diseases, the development of effective treatments has not kept
pace. Although gene replacement and modulation therapies can be powerful, sometimes even lifesaving
treatment options, they come with many risks, such as immunogenicity and oncogenicity. Programmable
nucleases such as CRISPR/Cas9 have revolutionized our ability to manipulate the genome, and provide the
potential to achieve lasting, precise genome modification for therapeutic benefit. The proposed U19 program
seeks to address these challenges through the development, validation and translation of gene editing–
based therapeutic solutions for rare neurological genetic diseases. We propose to focus on four
neurological conditions that each represent a significant unmet clinical need: Spinal Muscular Atrophy,
Friedrich's Ataxia, Huntington's Disease, and Rett Syndrome. Members of our team have developed a suite of
base and prime genome editing tools that can install precise alterations without creating a DSB or requiring a
donor template. We also have developed validated in vivo mouse models for each of these diseases and bring
deep expertise in the IND-enabling preclinical evaluation of gene-editing therapeutics. We propose to merge
these considerable assets with disease-specific expertise in each of the four neurological conditions, supported
by expertise and resources for scaled production of AAV-based delivery vectors for delivery of precision gene-
editing therapies to tissues, and for navigating the regulatory path to IND submission. The proposed U19 team
has a track record of individual and collaborative success at every step of the preclinical pipeline pathway and
is thus well positioned to achieve our milestones, which include an IND package submitted to FDA for at least
one therapy and neurological condition. Our Overall Aims are to: 1) Assemble a multi-disciplinary team with
unique strengths and expertise to develop and implement innovative genome editing strategies to address
important disease of the CNS, including Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Friedreich's Ataxia, Huntington's Disease, and
Rett Syndrome; 2) Optimize lead base editor and prime editor candidates for each disease area, utilizing in vitro
platforms and validated animal models; 3) Execute definitive preclinical in vivo pharmacology studies on
optimized leads to develop reproducible efficacy data, while monitoring biodistribution, PK/PD, tolerability, and
toxicology; and 4) Advance one lead candidate to an allowable investigational new drug (IND) application through
coordinated communication with the FDA INTERACT program, the research project team, and the project Cores."
10842401,"SUMMARY ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
Collaborative science faces unique challenges that parallel the size and scope of the project or Program. Beyond
increased scientific challenges (such as data integration and harmonization), so too do the challenges to
coordinate, communicate, and collaborate effectively within the Program increase. The proposed project includes
four major research projects, supported by three resource cores, executed by a diverse multi-disciplinary team
distributed across five research institutions. The goal of this Administrative (Admin) Core is to facilitate their
coordination, communication, and collaboration. Our leadership team has extensive experience coordinating and
managing large, multi-investigator programs; most notably as a small animal testing center in Somatic Cell
Genome Editing (SCGE) Phase I funding, and as a precision genetics center (JAX Center for Precision Genetics,
JCPG) improving animal models of human disease and move them towards translation to the clinic. In each of
these programs, we have established frameworks for organizing our teams, sharing information across projects
and institutions, tracking progress and milestones, and communicating progress to key stakeholders as well as
the NIH program officers. Our previous experience leading Administration/Coordination Cores for multi-
institutional, NIH-funded Programs makes us uniquely qualified to develop and execute on the administrative
goals of this U19. The Admin Core will provide managerial and administrative structure for this U19 Program
through the following Aims. In Aim 1 we establish an effective administrative governance structure to assure
success of this U19 Program. We use prior experience and Program-specific characteristics to build a clear
hierarchy of governance and include guidance from clinical experts in neurodegenerative diseases to hasten
IND application. In Aim 2 we develop a formal meeting schedule to foster the communication needed to execute
on the goals of this proposal. The Admin Core will be responsible for managing this schedule, recording, and
reporting out on the progress and action items identified in these meetings. The Admin Core will use these
reports to monitor progress toward milestones of the Program and each Project for Aim 3, assisting NIH Program
officials in their alignment of our Program with SCGE Phase II. Finally, the Admin Core will communicate the
findings from this U19 Program with the Translational Coordination and Dissemination Center for external
distribution and assist in the creation of a shared learning and training education hub."

large number of gene editing designs, mice provide a tractable, mammalian system to clearly demonstrate
functional efficacy in vivo using a validated model of disease. These data are critical to support an IND for new
treatments. The Preclinical Mouse Model Core is structured to provide centralized and scaled access to models,
in vivo delivery expertise, and phenotyping capabilities to support the individual disease research projects for
this program, towards our goal of IND-enabling validation of genomic editing therapeutics. The Jackson
Laboratory (JAX) houses the world's largest collection of mouse models of human disease, including all key
models for this program. In addition, JAX has leveraged its expertise and scale to develop a broad set of services
that will serve to further support the needs of the individual projects in a cost-effective and high-throughput
manner. This includes our Genetic Engineering Technology team who has, over the past 3 years, executed more
than 2,200 CRISPR/Cas9-based projects of all levels of complexity for 400+ investigators around the world,
including the large-scale, high-throughput KOMP2 Center that has produced more than 1,000 gene knockouts.
JAX has also built, outfitted, and opened a world-class mouse phenotyping clinic, the JAX Center for Biometric
Analysis, which serves both individual faculty projects as well as larger-scale phenotyping needs. Critically, our
proposed Core will build on our current experience as a Small Animal Testing Center for the current Phase of
the Somatic Cell Genome Editing consortium. This program leverages the capabilities of the JAX In Vivo
Pharmacology Service, which provides comprehensive pre-clinical efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
testing using mouse models. Over the past four years, our testing center has worked with 10 funded teams to
provide second-site validation of novel genome editor delivery systems, independently evaluating their efficiency
and specificity in reporter models. The Preclinical Mouse Models Core will take full advantage of this exceptional
infrastructure and expertise to achieve the goals of this U19 program. We propose these Specific Aims: 1) To
provide key animal model resources to support the individual disease projects, including optimization of models
and cohort generation; and 2) To execute delivery validation studies that build on proof-of-principle experiments
for each disease project."
10842412,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 2 (FRDA)
Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive ataxia and damage
to the nervous system, that is often associated with muscle weakness, spasticity, cardiomyopathy and diabetes
mellitus. FRDA is caused by a deficiency in frataxin (FXN) protein levels that usually arises from a GAA-triplet
repeat expansion in intron 1 of the FXN gene which results in transcriptional repression. The length of FXN GAA-
repeats in the general population ranges from ~5-60, while FRDA patients may present with 66 to well over 1200
repeats, typically 600 to 900 repeats long. Long GAA-repeats undergo progressive instability in some somatic
cell types that predominantly results in repeat expansion and consequently loss of FXN protein. The tissues that
are affected in FRDA include the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), the heart, and the pancreas. The onset of disease
in patients is anticorrelated with the length of the shortest FXN allele, which typically presents at 10-15 years of
age, though approximately 25% of patients have an atypical presentation with later disease onset.
Although some symptoms can be ameliorated by physical therapy and surgery, no effective cure or treatment
for the broader FRDA phenotype has yet been approved. The life expectancy for patients with FRDA is typically
40-50 years of age.
In this follower project, we aim to improve FXN protein expression to enable rescue of disease progression in
FRDA patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Optimize genome editing strategies to correct FRDA repeat
expansion; (2) optimize genome editing strategies to correct FRDA repeat expansion in mice; and (3) perform
pre-clincial IND enabling studies to assess safet and efficacy. We will work closely with the Gene Editing Core
to develop the latest base editing and/or prime editing technologies in FRDA model systems. We will iterate with
the Gene Editing Core to ensure that our genome editing tools maximize on-target editing efficiencies, minimize
undesirable gene editing byproducts and off-target editing events, and maximize compatibility with in vivo
delivery methods of potential therapeutic relevance."
10842418,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 4 (Rett)
Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the gene MECP2.
The majority of RTT is caused by the same d eight reoccurring mutations in mutational hotspots of the 3rd and
4th exons. These four missense mutations and four nonsense mutations (R106W, R133C, T158M, R168X,
R255X, R270X, R294X, and R306C) make up 70% of all Rett cases. RTT predominantly affects females,
occurring at an incidence of 1-10,000 live female births and presents as a regression in milestones between the
ages of 6-18 months. Hallmark characteristics of Rett include progressive loss of purposeful hand skills, speech
and language regression, gait abnormalities, and stereotypic hand movements. Other features of the disorder
include decelerated head growth, sleep disturbances, breathing abnormalities, and a high incidence of seizures.
The life expectancy for patients with Rett is typically around 40-50 years of age. Landmark studies using
conditional mouse models of Mecp2 to turn on the endogenous Mecp2 mouse gene post-symptomatically have
convincingly demonstrated that neurological deficits associated with loss of Mecp2 is reversible to a significant
degree. To date, clinical trials have focused on small molecules that modulate mechanisms downstream of
MECP2. With more the 25+ such trials, limited success has been demonstrated with only modest behavior
modifications and no approved FDA drugs for RTT. Gene and protein replacement strategies have been stymied
with regards to controlled dosage affects that require precise titration of MECP2, as overexpression of Mecp2 in
cells is toxic and are further confounded by the X-linked nature of the disease with cell to cell variation of MECP2
expression resulting from chromosome X-linked inactivation. For these reasons, base editing strategies that
directly correct the endogenous genetic mutation and restore MECP2 to endogenous cellular levels are an
extremely attractive therapeutic strategy for RTT.
In this follower project, we aim to correct missense and nonsense mutations to enable rescue of disease
progression in Rett patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Design, test and optimize Base Editing, Prime editing
and Twin Editing strategies for 5 different mutations; (2) Test these strategies in mouse models containing
humanized exons with engineered missense and nonsense mutations. (3) Perform pre-clinical IND enabling
studies to assess safety and efficacy. We will work closely with the Gene Editing Core to develop the latest base
editing and/or prime editing technologies in RTT model systems. We will iterate with the Gene Editing Core to
ensure that our genome editing tools maximize on-target editing efficiencies, minimize undesirable gene editing
byproducts and off-target editing events, and maximize compatibility with in vivo delivery methods of potential
therapeutic relevance."
10659169,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In human bodies, bleeding is stopped when a clot is formed at the site of vascular damage. Under rapid flow
conditions, the plasma protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) plays an indispensable role in capturing both
platelets and collagen on damaged vessel walls, allowing the formation of platelet plugs. The adhesion between
VWF and platelets is mediated by the interaction between the A1 domain of VWF and the Ib chain of the
platelet receptor GPIb-IX complex. Gain-of-function mutations in A1 that enhance this interaction lead to type
2B von Willebrand disease (VWD). Targeting the A1GPIb-IX interaction has been an emerging strategy to treat
or preempt bleeding and thrombotic disorders, though success in this area has been very limited. The lack of
progress is due largely to the enigmatic nature of how exactly A1 remains inactive in blood circulation and how it
is instantly activated to bind to GPIb-IX upon bleeding. Our recent identification of an autoinhibitory module
(AIM), consisting of N- and C-terminal flanking regions on A1 and their O-linked glycans, is crucial for
understanding A1 mechanoactivation during bleeding. In addition, AIM can be unfolded by a tensile pulling force
of 8 to 20 pN. Based on these preliminary discoveries, we hypothesize that O-linked glycan structures,
particularly sialic acids, further stabilize AIM and contribute to the mechanical regulation of A1GPIb-IX binding
and that modulating AIM’s mechanical properties can be utilized to treat or preempt blood diseases. We propose
to test this potentially paradigm-shifting hypothesis using state-of-the-art analytical biophysical tools, including
single-molecule force spectroscopy, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and all-atom molecular
dynamics simulation. Three specific aims will be pursued to test the hypotheses. Aim 1 is to characterize the
structure and biomechanical properties of AIM. Aim 2 is to determine how autoinhibition is regulated by O-linked
glycosylation in AIM. And Aim 3 is to investigate the role of AIM in type 2B VWD and therapeutic applications.
Completion of the proposed studies will identify the key molecular and biophysical mechanisms underlying how
AIM mechanically regulates VWF function and platelet binding and will aid in devising novel therapeutic
strategies for the prevention and treatment of human blood disease."
10884507,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
BCL-2 proteins participate in a dynamic interaction network that determines whether a cell will live or die.
Deregulation of this essential signaling pathway underlies the pathogenesis of human cancer and resistance to
treatment. The goal of this R35 research program is to elucidate the fundamental protein interaction mechanisms
that drive the apoptotic program and harness these insights to develop next-generation cancer treatments. Over
the last five years of R35 support, we applied novel chemical tools and a host of analytical technologies to
achieve mechanistic discoveries that revealed new druggable binding sites and compounds to target them. We
found that covalent modification of distinct cysteines in pro-apoptotic BAX and anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BFL-1
differentially regulate their apoptotic functions. Our pursuit of covalent ligands that mimic these post-translational
modifications are yielding prototype BAX activators and MCL-1 and BFL-1 inhibitors for cancer therapy.
Deciphering how BAX and BAK are directly activated, and the conformational mechanisms that underlie their
conversion from latent monomers into toxic mitochondrial oligomers, has also been a major focus of our work.
Indeed, the elusive structures of the BAX and BAK death channels represent the “holy grail” of apoptosis
research. We recently generated the first full-length homogeneous BAX oligomer (BAXO) amenable to structure-
function characterizations, providing a glimpse into the macromolecular organization of a functional BAXO
species. BAXO and its mutants are enabling us to pinpoint the structural determinants for each step of the BAX-
activation pathway and thus inform new control points for pharmacologic activation of apoptosis. In addition to
dissecting these high-priority, canonical BCL-2 protein interactions, we have developed proteomic tools to
identify non-canonical targets and recently found that MCL-1 directly interacts with the fatty acid oxidation
enzyme VLCAD, revealing a dual role for MCL-1 at the intersection of apoptosis and metabolic regulation. We
hypothesize that MCL-1-driven cancers rely on both apoptotic suppression and fatty acid metabolism to
maximize pathologic survival, potentially explaining why MCL-1 is the most widely expressed anti-apoptotic
protein across human cancers. Here, we build on our newest mechanistic insights to interrogate a spectrum of
BCL-2 family interactions that drive human cancer and mine each opportunity to pharmacologically subvert them.
Specifically, our next set of R35 goals are: (1) identify the structural and functional determinants that mediate
the “execution phase” of mitochondrial apoptosis; (2) solve the structure of a BAX oligomer; (3) characterize the
non-canonical role of MCL-1 at the intersection of apoptosis and cancer metabolism; and (4) advance the
development and in vivo testing of BCL-2 family molecular modulators as next-generation therapies for human
cancer. We tackle these goals using multidisciplinary approaches that span chemistry, structural biology,
proteomics, biochemistry, cell biology, and in vivo testing. As a chemical biologist and pediatric oncologist, I am
committed to transforming our fresh mechanistic insights into new therapies for relapsed and refractory cancers."
10901944,"Voltage-gated calcium ion channels are critically important proteins that regulate release of glutamate and
substance P from nociceptors in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. As such, they serve as the
gatekeepers, at the junction of the periphery and central nervous system, conveying information about touch,
heat, mechanical stimulation and more to the brain. High heat or strong mechanical stimuli are noxious and
perceived in the brain as painful. Neurons that detect potentially harmful signals, such as high heat, are
essential for protecting the body against damage. In response to continued stimulation, such as occurs in
tissue injury, these neurons can sensitize as part of a protective response, but their sensitivity usually returns
to normal after healing. In certain chronic pain conditions, such as after peripheral nerve injury, the sensitivity
of nociceptors fails to return to pre injury levels and normal heat and touch continue to be perceived as painful.
This persistence of sensitization combined with ongoing spontaneous activity of pain circuits can result in
unrelenting, chronic pain. Understanding the molecular and cellular changes that occur during the transition
from normal to chronic pain states are the key to improving current – inadequate – therapies. This proposal
builds on our recent discoveries and our unique expertise to determine the role of voltage-gated calcium ion
channels in sensory neurons that contribute to chronic pain. We study Cacna1a and Cacna1b genes that
encode the core subunits of two calcium ion channels, CaV2.1 and CaV2.2, that control transmitter release at
the majority of synapses in the mammalian nervous system. We tackle two critically important questions in our
overall objective to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate Cacna1a and Cacna1b processing
and their actions in different subtypes of sensory neurons that transmit information about thermal and
mechanical stimuli: Aim 1. What cellular factors control the expression of the major forms of CaV2 channels in
thermal and mechanical signaling? What molecular changes disrupt the normal pattern of expression of these
calcium ion channels in chronic pain? Aim 2. How do different calcium ion channels function in thermal and
mechanical signaling at peripheral nerve endings in skin? And do the abnormal expression patterns of different
forms of ion channels contribute to the induction and maintenance of abnormal signaling? Our research
addresses major gaps in our understanding, and the results will contribute to new strategies and reveal new
targets for pharmacological or genetic approaches, to mitigate certain forms of chronic pain experienced by
millions of people in the United States."
11179712,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this proposal is to find novel mechanisms whereby surfactant protein A (SPA)
regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype modulation. SMC transition from a
differentiated to dedifferentiated phenotype in addition to neointima formation/vascular remodeling has
a critical role in human diseases such as the development of atherosclerosis, restenosis after
angioplasty or bypass, diabetic vascular complications, arteriopathy transplants, asthma and cancer.
Mechanisms that regulate SMC phenotype modulation and neointima formation are not well
understood. The physiological function of SPA is its secretion by type II alveolar cells to maintain
minimal surface tension in the lungs. However, preliminary data indicate a role for SPA as a SMC
phenotype modulator. In vivo, SPA was expressed in the medial and neointimal SMCs following
mechanical injury in rat and mouse carotid arteries. The wire-injury induced intimal hyperplasia was
dramatically attenuated in SPA knockout mice. Furthermore, increased mRNA expression of SMC
contractile genes and key regulators for contractile SMC phenotype, Myocardin and TGF-β1 was
observed in SMCs isolated from SPA knockout mice. Additionally, SMCs from SPA knockout mice had
increased Smad3 phosphorylation and the increase was blocked by the TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody.
SPA is localized in the nucleus of SMCs suggesting it may have a role in SMC gene transcription.
Indeed, SPA deficiency increased smooth muscle α-actin and smooth muscle 22-α promoter activity
whereas recombinant SPA protein attenuated their activities. Hence, the central hypothesis is that
SPA regulates SMC phenotype modulation and vascular remodeling through both extracellular (via
modulating TGF-β1 signaling) and intracellular (Myocardin-related gene transcription) mechanisms.
Using primary culture of SMC, in vivo mouse wire injury models combined with molecular, cellular and
histological approaches, this proposal will 1) determine the molecular extracellular and intracellular
mechanisms by which SPA regulates SMC phenotypic modulation; and 2) determine if SPA is essential
for SMC phenotype modulation/vascular remodeling in vivo. Project completion will uncover novel
mechanisms regulating SMC phenotypic modulation and provide understanding into whether SPA is a
potential target for therapy against vascular damage associated with common vascular diseases such
as diabetes, restenosis, atherosclerosis and cancer. The training plan laid out by the sponsor and the
outstanding environment in the mentor’s laboratory and at the University of Missouri will safeguard the
successful completion of the proposed studies."
10895465,"Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most common arboviral disease globally, with up to 400 million infections and 25,000 deaths annually. The related flavivirus Zika virus (ZIKV) has also spread rapidly across the tropics and subtropics, and outbreaks of both DENV and ZIKV infection have now reached the continental United States. There are currently no effective antiviral agents against either virus, no DENV vaccine approved for use in the United States, and no ZIKV vaccine. Our long-term goal is to comprehensively identify and characterize the cellular pathways required for flavivirus infection, as these may represent novel targets for antiviral treatment. We and others have identified the host Endoplasmic Reticulum Membrane Protein Complex (EMC) as required for infection by multiple flaviviruses, including DENV and ZIKV. The EMC appears to function as a molecular chaperone, promoting the biogenesis of multipass membrane proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, how the EMC supports flavivirus infection is unknown. Strikingly, our published findings reveal that during infection, the EMC is required by flavivirus replication by promoting the biogenesis of flavivirus NS4A and NS4B at an early post-translational step. Both proteins are non-structural multipass transmembrane proteins essential for viral replication. The objective of this proposal is to define how the EMC supports DENV and ZIKV replication. Our central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data, is that the EMC functions as a molecular chaperone for the proper biogenesis of select flavivirus-encoded multipass transmembrane proteins. This proposal leverages the complementary strengths of an investigator with extensive experience in flavivirus-host biology (Tai), and another in ER-quality control mechanisms hijacked during viral infection (Tsai). The specific aims of the project are to (1) Define and validate the viral determinants of EMC dependence; (2) Determine the specific role of the EMC in flaviviral replication; and (3) Characterize DENV and ZIKV mutants that bypass EMC dependency. Successful completion of this project will illuminate the mechanism by which the EMC supports flavivirus infection, thereby providing insights into a novel vulnerability shared by these medically important viruses. It will also increase our understanding of other viruses that require the EMC."

Overture is a collection of modular, open-source software components designed to make the management of
big-data genomic projects both easy and more cost effective. The Overture system promotes FAIR data
sharing of cancer genomic datasets by overcoming the major obstacles in storing, managing, exploring, and
distributing massive genome-scale datasets.
In this proposed project, we will implement a turnkey Overture Data Management System (DMS) to provide a
complete solution to manage cancer genomic data throughout the data life cycle, and to continue lowering the
technical barriers faced by researchers in the cancer informatics community. To extend the capabilities and
potential of the Overture DMS, we will establish a new software framework for integration with third-party
visualization applications, and for data exchange with analysis platforms. This framework will empower the
community to continue developing extremely valuable visualization applications for specific research interests
and datatypes, and to contribute them as “apps” to be integrated with the Overture DMS.
Over the next five years, we will: (1) combine the core set of Overture components into a scalable DMS
installation bundle to promote both local and cloud deployment for a range of small to consortia-scale datasets;
(2) extend the DMS with third-party visualization and analysis tools through a novel software data integration
framework; (3) enhance data access controls by implementing Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH) Passport and Data Use Ontology standards; (3) enable federated searching within cancer datasets
across different Overture platforms; and (4) improve outreach and community resources to meet the needs of
bioinformaticians, data producers and managers, data scientists, and clinical researchers. The Overture DMS
will be a valuable resource for removing complications of large-scale data management from researchers,
allowing the advancement of scientific research by increasing data sharing and discovery."

Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) released from the hypothalamus is known for its role as the
neuroendocrine stress mediator by regulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. However,
CRF signaling in extrahypothalamic brain regions also plays a key role in regulation of positive and
negative reinforcement of motivated behaviors in response to stressors through distinct CRF neural
circuits. Moreover, sex biases in CRF signaling may underlie female vulnerability to anxiety and
depression. Recently, we showed that the lateral ahebnula (LHb), an anti-reward brain region also
implicated in anxiety and depression, is a highly CRF-responsive brain region although the source of this
extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission to the LHb and its behavioral relevance in both sexes are still
unknown. Therefore, in this R21 grant proposal, we aim to explore the contribution of a newly identified
LHb neuronal subpopulation that expresses CRF (LHbCRF neurons) and provides a local inhibitory circuit
within the LHb in regulation of LHb activity and related anxiety-related behaviors in a sex- and circuit-
specific manner. Our specific aims are to identify the role of LHbCRF→LHb circuit in anxiety-related
behaviors and in CRF-dependent regulation of LHb. Our innovative experimental approach utilizing
mouse genetics, viral-based strategies, ex vivo optogenetics with electrophysiology, chemogenetics,
GCaMP calcium imaging, and behavior in female and male mice will enable us to uncover novel roles for
CRF in circuit-specific regulation of LHb function and LHb-related anxiety behaviors with implications
in stress-related disorders and female susceptibility to stress."
10911144,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Herpesviruses cause a substantial worldwide burden on human health. In response to infections by these and
other pathogens, host cells express thousands of interferon-stimulated genes. One such gene encodes the
myxovirus resistance protein B (MxB) that potently restricts several herpesviruses, including herpes simplex
virus 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), and cytomegalovirus (CMV). MxB has been undergoing rapid
evolution in primates, as reflected in genetic signatures of positive selection, suggesting that MxB has been
engaged in arms races with viruses over millions of years. Intriguingly, unlike human MxB, the MxB alleles from
several non-human primates do not inhibit HSV-1 replication. In contrast, all tested orthologs retain antiviral
activity against CMV. These results suggest that human MxB, but not non-human primate orthologs, including
the closely related chimpanzee gene, has evolved to restrict HSV-1. This scenario appears to be a rare example
of the host side “winning” during an evolutionary arms race with a virus. To dissect the mechanism MxB utilizes
to restrict HSV-1, studies in Aim 1 will define the role of specific residues that are necessary and sufficient to
explain differing restrictive phenotypes of human and chimpanzee MxB orthologs. Experiments aiming to identify
viral factors that are the targets of MxB, as well as which host co-factors are potentially required, will employ
proximity ligation assays coupled with mass spectrometry. Building on the observation that HSV-2 strains vary
in their sensitivity to human and chimpanzee MxB, Aim 2 will identify which other primate MxB orthologs restrict
which strains of HSV-2, which will help elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of the development of the phenotype.
Additionally, because human MxB restricts only a subset of HSV-2 strains, analyses of sequence differences
among the strains will aid in the identification of viral determinants of MxB sensitivity. Together, this proposal will
reveal the critical factors mediating the arms races between MxB and herpes simplex viruses and will aid in
elucidating the anti-herpesvirus mechanism of MxB."

Hospital acquired infections are a major problem in the United States, affecting approximately 2 million patients
and causing at least 90,000 deaths ever year. New strategies are needed to combat these infections,
especially in light of rising antimicrobial resistance rates among pathogens. Vaccines, one of the most
impactful medical technologies in history, are based on adaptive immunological memory responses, which are
long lasting and antigen specific. It is now known that cells of the innate immune system also can mount
memory responses, but unlike adaptive memory responses, they provide protection against a broad variety of
pathogens. This phenomenon is termed innate immune memory or trained immunity and is a potential solution
for preventing infections in vulnerable populations. The mechanisms behind innate immune memory are not
well understood. Toll-like receptor 4 ligands, including the vaccine adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA),
induce innate immune memory in macrophages. MPLA treatment of macrophages causes metabolic
reprogramming as well as increases antimicrobial functions in vitro. In vivo, it protects against Gram-positive
bacterial, Gram-negative bacterial, and fungal infections. Our preliminary data shows that MPLA treatment
induces high expression of Immunoresponsive gene 1 (Irg1), the enzyme which catalyzes production of
itaconate, leading to improved bacterial clearance, an effect that is reduced in Irg1 knockout mice. Itaconate is
known to alter metabolism through inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase. It is also an antimicrobial metabolite
recently discovered to be delivered to bacteria-containing vacuoles. Based on these findings, we hypothesize
that Irg1 and itaconate enable the generation of innate immune memory by facilitating macrophage
metabolic reprogramming and augmenting lysosome-mediated antimicrobial functions. Aim 1 will
determine the role of Irg1 in generation of the memory phenotype in vitro. Irg1 knockout bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDM) will be studied to determine the contribution of Irg1 to the metabolic and functional
changes associated with memory. Treatment with exogenous itaconate will be explored to determine its ability
to induce innate immune memory separately from Irg1 activation. Aim 2 will explore the contributions of Irg1 to
MPLA-induced protection against infection and disease tolerance in vivo. Knowledge of the mechanism of
innate immune memory is critical to its translation to the clinical setting. This project will be undertaken as part
of physician-scientist training through the Vanderbilt MSTP."

As the population ages, late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is becoming an increasingly important public
health issue. AD disproportionately affects women. Of the more than 5 million people in the United States
afflicted with this disease, two-thirds are women. Women with AD have more neuropathology than men with
AD, have more severe cognitive symptoms, and more severe neurodegeneration, suggesting that the disease
affects male and female brains in different ways. Thus, a focus on sex differences in AD is essential to move
the field towards effective interventions. The identification of sex-specific genetic drivers of AD and AD-related
endophenotypes could transform the way treatments are administered and be a critical step towards
personalized interventions for AD. Research from both our group and others has begun to uncover genetic
factors that explain some of the observed differences between males and females, specifically in terms of AD
neuropathology and cognitive decline. To advance the field, additional genetic effects must be discovered and
the underlying mechanisms of sex-specific pathways of injury must be examined. The objective of this project
is to identify and replicate genetic effects that act in a sex-specific manner to drive the neuropathological
presentation and clinical progression of AD. The present proposal will advance our understanding of sex-
specific genetic contributors to AD endophenotypes by leveraging data from 30 studies of aging and AD
(n=33,740) to assess genetic associations with AD neuropathology and cognitive decline. The outcome of this
project will highlight new candidate pathways and begin the process of characterizing the mechanisms by
which genetic variation among males and females affects the risk and clinical symptoms of AD. The sex-
specific pathways identified will offer therapeutic targets and help move the field towards personalized
interventions that consider an individual’s sex and neuropathological presentation."

funding mechanism from an R25 to a T34, this new program proposal is seeking NIH support for a new five-
year grant cycle in order to recruit talented individuals with unique perspectives and experiences to the
biomedical workforce. To date, 143 students from first generation, and often immigrant families, have
benefitted from the Kansas State University Bridges to the Baccalaureate training program. The families of
the majority of the Bridges to the Future students have migrated from Spanish-speaking countries to work in
the meat packing plants and agricultural industries where they work long hours and encounter numerous
financial, health, language, and cultural challenges. Thirty-five Bridges students are currently enrolled at K-
State; and at least 39 have pursued advanced research degrees or entered professional health programs.
Community college students are ready to enroll in Bridges pending funding. This proposal shows solid
support from all four colleges to maintain a critical and successful pathway for Bridges students to enter the
university: 1) by building relationships with the students and their families while at the community colleges; 2)
by bringing students and their families to K-State to help them become familiar with the larger campus, the
support staff, and previously matriculated Bridges students; 3) by providing an established, highly successful
undergraduate research program, the Developing Scholars Program, to support them academically and
personally; and 4) by providing seminars, workshops, lab experiences, and research internships to help
students explore their options in STEM disciplines for biomedical careers. Through the Bridges program,
students are prepared to succeed in graduate and professional programs, and to establish thriving
professional careers. Kansas State University will continue to provide 40% tuition for 1.5 years followed by
100% tuition for 0.5 years of study at the university, thus removing cost-related barriers that are often
insurmountable for underrepresented students. Each of the community colleges will also continue to provide
tuition scholarships to Bridges students to complete their associate degrees. The overall goal of this project is
to provide biomedical research training and mentoring in order to increase the number of underrepresented
students with baccalaureate degrees in STEM disciplines for future careers in the biomedical, clinical,
behavioral and social sciences. Further, this project will support the goals of the National Institutes of Health
for enhancing public trust, solving complex problems, increasing the likelihood that health disparities and the
needs of underrepresented populations are addressed in biomedical research, and ensure a diverse pool of
highly trained biomedical scientists."

The overall goal of this Application is to improve our understanding of the genetic and molecular control of

growth and steroidogenesis of the offspring during development and after birth. Specifically we intend to 1]
Establish that maternal Ocn is necessary for proper adrenal gland development and function. We will also 2]
Establish genetically and in vivo that osteocalcin favors adrenal gland growth and steroidogenesis by signalling
directly in the adrenal cortices through its receptor Gpr158. A third purpose of this application is to determine
with precision the temporal course of osteocalcin’s effect on the adrenal gland development/function and
investigate how maternal osteocalcin affects this process in the offspring. We will use mouse genetic,
molecular and biochemical assays to investigate the molecular bases of the cross-talk between bone and the
adrenal gland through osteocalcin in the regulation of adrenal steroid production. Together, this application will
significantly advance our understanding of adrenal development and physiology in bony vertebrates by
describing a novel regulation of adrenal gland development and steroidogenesis, which originates from the
mother and is biologically relevant since its absence can be lethal."
10890145,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most prevalent breast cancer, which is the most
common malignancy affecting women in the United States. Although ILC has unique molecular and clinical
features, it is not well-studied, and no specific therapeutic strategies exist for it. One of the major challenges in
the treatment of women with ILC is determining whether cytotoxic chemotherapy should be utilized or not.
Currently available gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype and Mammaprint tests) classify the majority of ILC
tumors as molecularly “low risk,” which suggests that cytotoxic chemotherapy will be ineffective. However, ILC
is more likely than other types of breast cancer to present at advanced stages with lymph node involvement,
making these patients clinically “high risk.” This “clinical high risk” status drives chemotherapy use in patients
with ILC, despite discordant results from molecular assays. Indeed, the majority of node-positive ILC patients
receive chemotherapy, despite the absence of data suggesting benefit for any individual patient. There is a
huge need to improve patient selection, so that chemotherapy can be utilized only in patients who will benefit
from it, while others can be spared its toxic side effects. In parallel, for patients with predicted poor response to
standard chemotherapy, we need personalized approaches that target the unique molecular pathways involved
in ILC. There have been recent advances in our understanding of ILC, and several groups have now identified
ILC specific gene signatures that show significant heterogeneity within this group of tumors. Given this newly
available data, we can now start incorporating ILC specific tools into clinical practice and develop tailored
treatment strategies for women with ILC. In this proposal, I will address this via the following three
approaches. First, I will evaluate a novel early indicator of chemotherapy responsiveness in ILC, improving our
ability to determine whether a tumor has responded or not. Given the relatively small numbers of ILC patients
in clinical trials, I will conduct a pooled analysis using 12 combined datasets from breast cancer patients
treated with pre-operative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. Second, I will leverage the recent discovery of ILC-
specific gene expression signatures and the data available in the I-SPY2 Trial to develop a predictive tool to
identify chemotherapy responders (Chemotherapy in Lobular breast cancer Effectiveness and Response
[CLEAR] score). Finally, I will conduct a pilot study testing a novel, targeted agent in combination with
endocrine therapy in the I-SPY2 Trial, through a new arm termed the Endocrine Optimization Pathway. This
project addresses an important, relevant clinical issue, utilizes new datasets and molecular signatures not
previously available, and importantly, will allow me to develop skills and knowledge in a mentored setting that
will facilitate my ability to design and conduct prospective clinical trials for women with ILC."

Infection with HIV significantly increases the risk of a host of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including
cancer, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary disease. In the era of widespread availability of antiretroviral
therapy and the corresponding increased life expectancy of persons with HIV (PWH), the incidence of NCDs has
increased and now is the leading cause of death. Unfortunately, substantial gaps remain in understanding
how HIV-infection potentiates the development of cancers and other NCDs, how to best prevent the
development of the chronic complications of HIV infection, and how cancers and NCDs are optimally
treated in PLHW. The Biomarkers, Prevention and Interventions for HIV-Associated Malignancies and
NCDs (BPIN) Core is a new Core that provides faculty expertise, diagnostic assays, imaging resources, access
to biorepositories, and mentoring related to both cancers and NCDs, building on the highly successful HIV-
Associated Malignancy (HIVAM) Core. In the past decade, the HIVAM Core collected data and biospecimens
from PWH who either were at risk for or who had already developed cancer, enabling impactful translational,
epidemiologic and clinical research. Access to tumor tissue and other biologic materials that are collected
through rigorous internationally-validated protocols and annotated with data that are critical to the understanding
of cancer biology has allowed CFAR-affiliated investigators to make important insights into the pathogenesis,
prevention and treatment of HIVAM including Kaposi Sarcoma, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Cervical Cancer and
Breast Cancer. Developmental efforts by the HIVAM Core fostered both the careers of new investigators as well
as established cancer researchers who bring their skills to HIVAM. Based on these successes, as well as input
from our local and international CFAR community, we have expanded our focus to cardiovascular and pulmonary
disease in HIV infection, providing CFAR members access to expert, imaging libraries and samples from
longitudinal cohorts in East Africa.
The BPIN Core has three Specific Aims: 1) Support new and established researchers in the fields of
NCD with the tools to design and implement impactful studies among PWH; 2) Collect and disseminate
high-dimension data and appropriately-preserved biospecimens from PWH with or at risk for NCDs to
CFAR investigators who seek to conduct basic and translational studies; and 3) Develop and distribute
state-of-the-art tools for novel studies of NCDs among PWH, including image analysis, histopathology,
and molecular diagnostic assays. Through these aims, CFAR members working with the BPIN core will
discover and evaluate biomarkers for the prevention and management of NCDs, describe the role of
inflammation, environmental factors and genetics in the development of NCDs, and develop new interventions
for the prevention and treatment of NCDs among PWH in the US and sub-Saharan Africa."
10808134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer-related cognitive impairments (CRCI) are some of the most distressing and burdensome effects of
breast cancer and its treatment. When patient reported outcomes (PROs) are used, up to 75% of survivors
report CRCI. Cognitive PROs are accessible, brief, and represent everyday cognitive functioning and quality of
life (QOL). Yet, cognitive PROs have been overlooked as primary outcomes in CRCI research, and there are
no best practices for measurement. To move the science forward, we have to determine which cognitive PRO
best reflects and predicts everyday functioning and QOL. We also need to assess CRCI within the context of
survivors’ real life where competing demands are high and functioning poor. This will facilitate a better
understanding of the individual variations and phenotypes of CRCI that traditional retrospective assessments
may not capture. Doing so will enhance our ability to detect and quantify clinical CRCI, and better measure
intervention effects aimed at improving CRCI. The proposed prospective study will collect data from 124 breast
cancer survivors (BCS, ages 21+) within 1 year of completing chemotherapy (baseline) and again 2 months
later (follow up). Between baseline and follow up data collection, ecological momentary assessments (EMAs)
will be administered daily for 56 days (5 total: current daily activity, self-ratings of anxiety, feelings of
depression, fatigue, cognitive functioning), and mobile cognitive tests (MCTs) for working memory, executive
functioning, processing speed, and memory (4 total) administered every other day. We aim to 1) compare
cognitive PRO predictors of everyday functioning (social function, QOL) across time and 2) determine
longitudinal relationships among real life contextual factors measured by EMAs, MCTs, and cognitive PROs (at
follow up). Considering the importance of PROs in healthcare research and the shift towards precision health
approaches to care, the gaps in knowledge and weaknesses of research using cognitive PROs in CRCI
research to date are critical. The proposed study is innovative in several ways: we will directly compare and
evaluate cognitive PROs based on their ability to predict everyday functioning and QOL which has not been
done before; and we will use a new methodology, intensive longitudinal assessments, to define CRCI and
capture day-to-day within person variability inherent to cognitive processes. Findings from Aim 1 will provide
data to inform instrument choices in CRCI practice and research. Findings from Aim 2 will establish the validity
and reliability of EMAs and MCTs in BCS with CRCI and facilitate accurate and precise measurement of the
lived experience. Both will facilitate rigorous observational and interventional research on CRCI in the future.
Our preliminary studies and previous work strongly support our ability to carry out the proposed study. This
study addresses the health promotion and prevention priority of the National Institute of Nursing Research—
specifically, tertiary prevention to reduce symptoms, severity, and progression of chronic diseases like cancer."
10846645,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Metabolic enzymes in cells rarely function in isolation. Often their activities are coordinated by physical or
covalent association with each other and cellular structures. A consequence of these associations is that
metabolic intermediates do not equilibrate with the cellular milieu and are instead channeled between
enzyme active sites. Despite the widespread recognition that protein-protein interactions are ubiquitous,
the molecular mechanisms of substrate channeling remain obscure, and the impact of channeling at the
cellular and organismal levels is largely unknown. We seek to narrow these knowledge gaps by exploring
substrate channeling within and between the enzymes of proline catabolism. The proposed experiments
will explore long-distance, allosteric communication between the active sites of the bifunctional enzyme
PutA using kinetic crystallography, assess the contributions of substrate channeling to bacterial fitness
and pathogenesis, and determine the first structure of a novel bifunctional enzyme that moonlights as a
transcriptional repressor using cryo-EM."
10927260,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
We aim to increase student’s understanding and interest in science through active participation in the first large-
scale surveillance initiative targeting avian viruses like influenza viruses (AIV) and avian paramyxoviruses
(APMV, also known as Newcastle disease virus) ever conducted in an urban area - New York City (NYC) - via
analysis of bird droppings. The New York City Virus Hunters (NYCVH) initiative will enable teachers, students
and interested community members to gain an understanding of the interaction of natural environments and
human health, while increasing their knowledge, confidence, and interest in science.
The NYCVH initiative will build on strong collaborations between the Krammer Laboratory at the Icahn School of
Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), a globally leading laboratory in virology, and BioBus, a leading NYC science
outreach and education institution. NYCVH will develop and provide all the training, equipment, materials, and
infrastructure needed to support this large-scale, community-science-driven research effort. NYCVH will be
designed to offer multiple entry points and levels of engagement for interested community scientists - such as
students, teachers or community members - to participate. Trainings will ensure that interested teachers gain an
understanding of modern viral surveillance techniques and have ways to easily incorporate NYCVH program
aspects of their choice into their work. Over the course of the program, 6000 middle and high school students
will be led by 100 teachers trained at workshops held at BioBus’s BioBase Harlem inside Columbia University’s
Zuckerman Institute. Workshops will introduce teachers to modern viral surveillance using molecular techniques,
experimental design, laboratory and bioinformatics methods, sampling kit components, and detail how teachers
and students can participate in research to prevent the next pandemic. Through BioBus’ network we will enlist
partner schools to broaden participation in the program including through large-scale sampling events. In
addition, and importantly, 25 high school students from historically underrepresented communities in science will
be trained to spearhead the initiative as Junior Research Scientists who will join the NYCVH as interns over the
academic year and get an intensive training in sampling, nucleic acid detection, sequencing, phylogenetic
analysis and virology in general to become the next generation of leading virologists. With ISMMS, BioBus and
plus a network of scientists from academic institutions and wildlife rehabilitators, those students will be supported
throughout their research process – study design, sample collection, sample processing, analyzing results, and
presenting their research at symposia.
This project will be evaluated using a mixed-methods approach tailored to understanding the impact of program
participation on all individuals. The structure of this program is designed to determine the feasibility and impact
of large-scale studies at the urban human – avian interface through participatory research, and influence on
student’s long-term STEM career goals."
10835062,"Neurodegenerative diseases are common and devastating disorders, which will become increasingly
prevalent as our population ages. Unfortunately, despite years of effort and some promising leads, we still
do not have disease-modifying therapies. To provide an alternative approach to studying these disorders
and identifying potential therapeutics we have pioneered the use of Drosophila as a model system for
studying neurodegeneration, with a particular emphasis on Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.
Our studies have allowed us to identify genes controlling neurodegeneration in our fly models. We have
subsequently verified these findings in vertebrate models of the diseases, in postmortem brain tissue from
patients and in patient-derived cells. In the current proposal we will capitalize on our prior progress by
exploring in mechanistic detail the role alterations of the spectrin cytoskeleton play in promoting
neurodegeneration in α-synucleinopathies. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that α-synuclein binds to
the ankyrin-binding domain of ß-spectrin and thereby perturbs autophagosome transport and maturation.
We have recently developed a powerful new model of α-synuclein toxicity in Drosophila. Our previous
model showed striking specificity for dopaminergic neurons. While valuable for exploring toxicity to
dopamine neurons, a very important cell type for Parkinson’s disease, the restricted pathology present
limited implementation of large-scale genetic screens. We have therefore created a model of α-synuclein
neurotoxicity in which age-dependent neurodegeneration is significantly more widespread. Our new model
has facilitated completion of a genome-scale genetic screen, an important strength of Drosophila models.
Importantly, our new α-synucleinopathy model employs a dual transcriptional system we have developed,
which allows simultaneous and independent manipulation of gene expression, at scale, in neurons and glia.
We can now define the broad complement of mechanisms by which glia control toxicity of α-synuclein in
neurons non-cell autonomously. Given the growing evidence for an important role for glia in
neurodegenerative disease, these studies have the potential for significant impact."
10802445,"The development of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays for the early detection of Head and Neck Cancer is
still an unmet medical need. Most assays being developed rely on a neoplastic cell biomarker often present in
only a proportion of neoplastic cells and/or a subset of patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell carcinoma
(HNSCC). As such, the intrinsic heterogeneity of the neoplastic cell within a single patient and across patients
de facto limits the sensitivity of these assays. To overcome this problem, we propose to monitor HNSCC
presence in the oral rinse using RNA aptamers that recognize tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells. These cells
infiltrate the lesion in high numbers and early during tumorigenesis, participate in tumor initiation and
progression, and predict recurrence in HNSCC. Additionally, these cells are quickly renewed in the tumor
microenvironment and release their content in the tumor microenvironment and nearby fluid.
We identified four RNA aptamers that recognize myeloid derived suppressor cells and macrophages in the
HNSCC tumor but not the myeloid counterparts in the blood or healthy tissues in all patients evaluated.
Additionally, our feasibility and proof of principle experiments indicate that these aptamers might discriminate
oral rinses of patients with head and neck cancers from those of healthy donors. We propose to test the
hypothesis that MDSC-specific aptamers used in linear surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) experiments can
detect HNSCC from the oral rinse with high sensitivity and specificity. We will first optimize the assay using
samples already banked in our institution. Then, we will perform a prospective clinical study in which we will test
oral rinses from 150 patients with biopsy-proven HNSCC (all stage, all sites) and 150 age-matched healthy
donors. In particular, we will compare side-by-side the sensitivity and specificity of LSPR assays using as ligand
either our MDSC specific aptamers or an antibody against CD44, a marker strongly associated with HNSCC that
is being developed for HNSCC diagnosis from the oral rinse with promising results.
In summary, we propose a novel approach for the early diagnosis of HNSCC, a disease often diagnosed only
in advanced stages when the prognosis is poor, and the treatment morbidity is high. Should our hypothesis be
true, we anticipate that assays based on the presence of MDSC may aid in detecting this malignancy at earlier
stages when treatments are most effective and less invasive."
10923921,"Project Summary/Abstract
The proposed project will demonstrate the feasibility of generating a complete synapse-level brain map
(connectome) by developing a serial-section electron microscopy pipeline that could scale to a whole mouse
brain. This work will image 10 cubic millimeters, itself an unprecedentedly large dataset that may exceed tens
of petabytes. Yet the mouse brain is 50 times larger. Reaching this ambitious goal will require advances in
whole-brain staining, imaging, image-processing, analysis, and dissemination tools. We will scale and test
these tools by producing a connectome of the hippocampal formation, a critical brain region for memory and
spatial navigation. Specifically, we will define our volume of interest via microCT scanning of a whole brain.
Then we will cut it into semithin serial sections and image them with multibeam scanning electron microscopy
and ion beam milling. This technique images a thin layer of tissue and then removes it to reveal the next layer
until each section is fully imaged, minimizing distortions caused by previous ultra-thin sectioning approaches.
 The imaging data will be processed by an improved version of our state-of-the-art pipeline. After quality
monitoring and image compression, our automated system will assemble the full volume from imaged slices
and then label tissue elements: neurons, glia, blood vessels, myelin, cell bodies, and synapses. This
reconstruction will then be proofread and registered to the Allen Institute brain atlas, allowing us to relate our
data to other types of data. Our analysis will identify cell types by region and layer, and reveal the detailed
connectivity of hippocampal formation circuits. Using custom software, we will integrate these structural results
on cell types with other approaches based on light microscopy and single-cell gene expression, allowing us to
relate our results to the extensive literature on hippocampal formation structure and function. To promote
diverse perspectives, we will involve undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds in the proofreading
and scientific discovery phases of our work, offering them mentoring as well as research experience.
 We will turn these data into a lasting resource for the scientific community and the public by scaling up
free access via online sharing tools to allow any interested party to render, proofread, or otherwise analyze the
cells and circuits in this volume. To illustrate how this resource can be combined with other discoveries, we will
define cell types based on their morphology and connectivity, characterize the relationship between these
assignments and transcriptomic-based classifications, and integrate this information with previous work.
Finally, we will define local and long-range microcircuit motifs in our data and use it to identify circuit principles
and mechanisms of memory and spatial cognition, by testing and improving models of the hippocampal
formation. Throughout the project, we will monitor key performance parameters, such as imaging throughput of
a single microscope, to evaluate the feasibility and cost of scaling up to a whole mouse brain connectome."
10764948,"Most soil transmitted helminth (STH) species have skin-penetrating larval stages that facilitate chronic human
infections causing significant morbidity worldwide. Although these infectious larvae (iL3) are known to release
a wide array of excretory-secretory products (ES) that damage skin and mucous membranes human hosts have
very little awareness of this process. Rare case reports indicate itch, but otherwise most people do not know
they are infected until there are gastrointestinal symptoms or anemia. This suggests that the pain-sensing
neurons in the skin may be actively silenced by worm ES. While the activity of transient receptor potential
channel vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-expressing sensory neurons is known to contribute to host protective immunity
against microbial and fungal pathogens, it is entirely unknown whether these skin neurons influence immunity
against STH infection. This major gap in knowledge is likely because current experimental methods use needle
injection to deliver iL3, which bypasses neurons that innervate the epidermal and dermal layers of skin. To
address this issue, we have developed a natural model of STH infection where the foot of a mouse is transiently
exposed to a saline bath of iL3, allowing natural penetration. Our preliminary studies show that significantly fewer
iL3 penetrate the skin of wild-type mice in a second exposure to iL3, indicating that resistance develops.
Optogenetics uses blue light to activate the cation channel rhodopsin (CHR2) that is expressed by specific cell
populations expressing the cre protein in transgenic mice. When we used this technique to activate TRPV1+
cells, we found a significant reduction in iL3 skin penetration suggesting that sensory neuron activity may
contribute to host protective mechanisms. Further, iL3 ES seem to reduce the ability of neurons to respond to
the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin. Thus, our overarching goal is to combine this parasite infection model system
with sensory neuroscience methods that non-invasively activate specific populations of pain or itch-sensing
neurons to investigate how neurons control the ability of iL3 to penetrate the skin. Aim 1 tests whether
optogenetic activation of nociceptors or other TRPV1+ cells augments host resistance against STH
through induction of skin neuropeptides, inflammatory cells and/or Type 2 and Type 17 cytokines. Also,
based on our data showing that treatment with ES products impairs sensory neuron activation, experiments in
Aim 2 seek to identify the molecules in ES products that suppress sensory neuron activation and
determine whether this equates with blunted behavioral responses to itchy or painful stimuli. Taken
together, this R21 stands to break new ground in understanding the neuroimmunology of host protection against
parasitic helminths and may reveal novel bioactive molecules with multidisciplinary therapeutic potential."

they are under-represented and underserved. HSTA submits this proposal with the novel approach of
using a team-based mentoring structure to facilitate the development and execution of Community Based
Participatory Research (CBPR) and Citizen Science (CI) projects, to be carried out by HSTA students.
HSTA marshals and links the efforts of an impressive network of mentors across educational levels to
support 160 junior students annually (800 over a five-year period) through HSTA TEAMS.
The innovation of HSTA TEAMS is in the combined use of the flexible structure of HSTA and the long
arc of mentorship linkages, connecting college to community through high school, and now middle
school students, in over half of WV counties across the state. It is the flexible structure of HSTA that
allows the HSTA BioMed Summer Institute and HSTA community-based after-school club curriculum to
respond to what is happening on the ground for HSTA families and communities, as well as with what the
research community is observing and investigating. The Biomedical Summer Institute at WVU for
teachers, mentors, and students directed by HSTA leadership and staff in collaboration with university
faculty sets the foundation for the HSTA academic year community-based after school clubs during
which specially trained HSTA teachers mentor students into research. Through the after-school club
curriculum HSTA students will use validated resources, supported by HSTA TEAMS of mentors, to
design STEM+M educational interventions or experiments with middle school students. The results of the
STEM+M community-based research projects will be disseminated through regional and state HSTA
research symposiums, as well as through national conferences and publications."
10890113,"The Community of Bilingual English-Spanish Speakers Exploring Issues in Science and Health (CBESS) seeks
to prepare bi-and multilingual students who are interested in health service professions. CBESS also supports a
learning community with teachers and administrators, by providing resources and an educational social
capital. CBESS will recruit Spanish- English bilingual high school students to take part in 17-month curricula
to include family-engaged career exploration, Next Generation Science Standard, youth-led summer residential
research program, community outreach, and mentoring. The U.S population faces challenges in receiving
quality care, increase in health disparities, and the lack of a diverse workforce. With a constant growth of racial
and ethnic diversity in communities, the need for diverse representation in health professions and the Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce is imperative. Hence, strengthening the health
professions workforce to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse and bilingual population is essential.
Aim 1. Increase interest of STEM plus health among Spanish-English bilingual rural high
school students through the CBESS curriculum. Using a well-match intervention-comparison design,
11th grade bi-lingual rural students will experience a 17-month CBESS curriculum is based on the Social
Cognitive Theory (SCT). The hypothesis driving this aim is that providing a rigorous program based on SCT
will significantly increase STEM + health self-efficacy and researcher identity for college readiness when
compared to those who are not exposed to the program.
Aim 2: Increase support of a professional learning community of high school counselors and
administrators from a rural School District in Northern Nevada. High school counselors work
alongside students, and school administrators to discover ways to help address social challenges that may
impact STEM interest, especially among underrepresented, first-generation, bilingual students. The
hypothesis is that training an excellent cadre of counselors will lead to an increase in awareness and education
in STEM and health-related opportunities for high school students, new opportunities for research, learning
new topics, and being exposed to excellent career models.
Aim 3. Increase parent/guardian college and career knowledge, and engagement with the
college planning process. Introducing students and their parents to the college planning process is
imperative to promote student success in higher education. The CBESS program supports students and their
families in learning about different STEM and health careers, the college application process, funding options,
and having a positive education outcome for their students. The hypothesis driving this aim is that parents
who are more knowledgeable and “equipped” with the necessary resources regarding the college planning
process will provide more moral and family support to their child in a culturally relevant manner."
10772174,"An optically accessible adult vertebrate model is needed to study dynamic cellular processes in vivo. We aim to develop
and characterize Danionella cerebrum, a teleost related to zebrafish that remains transparent into adulthood, for studying
immune-related biological processes and their impact on disease progression in multiple organs. A transparent adult model
is particularly important for live imaging studies of immune related processes due to the dynamic and complex nature of
immune cell heterogeneity and plasticity, the involvement of infiltrating immune cells during disease progression, as well
as confounding factors related to aging. D. cerebrum, previously named as D. translucida, was first described by the
Judkewitz group in 2018 for brain-related studies. This genetically tractable model is small, adults reach a length of
approximately 12 mm in length, and is optical transparency even into adulthood. Established transgenesis and genome
editing methods used in zebrafish have showed to be effective in D. cerebrum. These characteristics make D. cerebrum an
attractive model for noninvasive in vivo visualization of dynamic and complex cellular events in a physiologically relevant
setting. This study aims to build the infrastructure required to use D. cerebrum as a systems biology model organism for
studying immune-related biological processes and their impact on disease progression. Our proof of principle experiments
have successfully generated transgenic lines with fluorescently labelled innate immune cells such as neutrophils and
macrophages, and the endothelial cells of the vasculature. We propose to expand our collection of transgenic D. cerebrum
lines by fluorescently labeling multiple organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and kidney. In combination, these transgenic
lines will allow us to visualize the complex interplay between immune cells and various organs throughout development,
injury and disease. We will also develop a macrophage/microglia fluorescent activity reporter line which will allow us to
observe and measure dynamic state changes displayed by immune cells in a physiologically relevant environment using
non-invasive in vivo imaging. To facilitate our studies, we will develop methods and equipment for longitudinal live
imaging of awake adult D. cerebrum. Immune cell functions play important roles in wound healing and regeneration.
Zebrafish are known to have great regeneration capacity in different organs, however, it is not known if D. cerebrum can
regenerate. Our preliminary work suggests that adult D. cerebrum can regenerate its tail fin but this regenerative capacity
decreased in aged animal. Our proposed study will investigate if D. cerebrum regenerates its central nervous system during
different developmental stages, its corresponding immune cell response and the transcriptomic changes that accompany
these events. We will also perform interspecies comparative analysis using available data from zebrafish regeneration
studies to explore key players in modulating regeneration capacity. This proposal describes strategies that will build the
infrastructure required to use D. cerebrum for immunology related studies in vivo. The tools, techniques and knowledge
built for the D. cerebrum immune model will provide an important springboard for carrying out future focused analyses on
immune-related processes that include, but by no means are limited to, inflammaging, wound healing/regeneration, cancer,

10834244,"Cerebral ischemia significantly alters the expression and/or function of transcriptional and translational
mechanisms including various classes of noncoding RNAs, epigenetics and epitranscriptomics. My
research in the past 20 years evaluated these mechanisms that are central in promoting either
secondary brain damage or recovery after stroke with a goal to design novel therapies. In the 7 years,
I will focus on studying the role of various RNAs in promoting post-stroke brain damage. The goal is to
understand the mechanisms as well as identifying new therapeutic targets to minimize the secondary
brain damage and to promote functional recovery after stroke. In this R35, I propose 4 projects. Project
1: In a currently funded RO1 grant we are evaluating the functional significance of an epigenetic
modification called DNA hydroxymethylation (5hmC). Our studies so far showed that stroke leads to
induction of 5hmC in many prosurvival genes that induces their expression. We intriguingly observed
that many lncRNA induced after stroke also show increased 5hmC levels. In this project, we will
continue the studies to understand the significance of 5hmC induction in lncRNAs to post-stroke
functional outcomes. Project 2: RNAs can be tagged by >150 distinct chemical modifications, which
are collectively defined as epitranscriptomic modifications that form an additional layer of post-
transcriptional gene regulation. Among them, methylation of the adenosine at N6-position (N6-
methyladenosine; m6A) is the most abundant modification in the brain. Our studies show that focal
ischemia downregulates m6A demethylase FTO leading to increased abundance of m6A-tagged
mRNAs. Many of these are inflammatory and apoptotic. Furthermore, activation of FTO promotes RNA
demethylation and neuroprotection. We will use molecular tools to evaluate the functional significance
and mechanisms of increased m6A methylation of RNAs in brain damage after stroke. Project 3: RNAs
can also undergo the epitranscriptomics modification of glycation and the neural glycoRNAs interact
with microglial Siglec receptors to dampen inflammation following CNS insults. We will study the
significance of glycoRNAs and the mechanism of action in brain after stroke. Project 4: Various classes
of RNAs collaborate in their actions. We particularly observed that circular RNAs interact with lncRNAs
to modulate mRNAs and microRNAs. We will analyze the role of RNA networks in relation to ischemic
brain damage using 2 examples. Project 4A: The first one is the interaction of a circRNA (circPUM1)
with a lncRNA (NORAD) to control a mRNA that codes an RNA binding protein (Pum1) and a mRNA
that codes BNIP2. Project 4B: An ongoing RO1 is studying the role of miR-7 in controlling -Synuclein
in post-stroke brain. Although mature miR-7 levels decrease after stroke, levels of premiR-7a and 7b
are not altered. As circRNA CDR1as binds and stabilizes miR-7, we are planning to study the interactive
role of this CDR1as-miR-7--Synuclein in mediating post-ischemic brain damage. Overall, the above
projects are all focused to evaluate the significance of various RNAs with a goal to find new
mechanisms and new targets to design future molecular therapies to curtail post-stroke brain damage."
10871881,"Project Summary
Heart failure is most commonly associated with poor contractile function due to multi-level pathologic
remodeling, including excitation-contraction coupling (ECC). This depends upon the proximity between
membrane-bound L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC) within the transverse (t)-tubule network and intracellular
ryanodine receptors (RyR), which are normally very tightly colocalized. The PI and others have shown that
abnormal mechanical load in vivo damages the t-tubule network, which results in uncoupling of LTCC and
RyR. Junctophilin (JPH2), BIN 1 and Telethonin (TCAP), in interaction with the microtubule network, regulate t-
tubule structure, but how they do so in response to load variation is not known. Prior experimental strategies
have been unable to assess the effect of direct mechanical loading upon isolated cardiomyocytes, nor have
they had the experimental flexibility to allow facile genetic manipulation of the pathways involved. Using new
methods to directly modulate mechanical load on isolated cardiomyocytes and intact human myocardium in
vitro, this K99/R00 seeks to test the hypothesis that t-tubule structure is normally regulated by a microtubule
dependent JPH2, BIN1 and TCAP pathway, which in conditions of direct mechanical overload is deranged by
microtubule mediated redistribution of JPH2, and reduced expression of JPH2, BIN 1 and TCAP. In Aim 1,
using a novel magnetorheological elastomer (MRE) culture system, isolated cardiomyocytes will be subjected
to pathological overload and undergo comprehensive characterization of ECC and t-tubule structure to test the
hypothesis that cardiomyocyte-autonomous mechanisms are sufficient to mediate the load-dependent
remodeling of the t-tubule system observed in heart failure. Because the phenotype arises in 48 hours,
comprehensive dissection of the underlying molecular mechanisms will be performed by combined live cell
imaging and adenoviral mediated genetic manipulations. Second, the novel but well-validated cardiac slice
method will be used to specifically control pre-load and after-load in order to vertically integrate insights
from cardiomyocyte-autonomous experiments in understanding the role of mechanical load regulation of the t-
tubule system at the level of the isolated myocardium, including in human control and diseased myocardium.
Mechanical unloading of failing hearts in vivo rescues t-tubule structure and ECC, which has been associated
with significant contractile improvements. Using the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2, failing cells and slices will
undergo mechanical unloading to determine the biomechanical and molecular mediators of this reverse
remodeling. The completion of this work will significantly add to the PI's post-doctoral training in cellular
electrophysiology, advanced super-resolution imaging and translational cardiovascular research and will be
essential for his transition to independence."
10665226,"Sensory receptor ion channels in somatosensory neurons are responsible for the sensory detection of
stimuli such as temperature changes and irritants. This information is then transmitted to the spinal cord and
brain, eliciting somatosensory perception, including nociception. Integration of sensory information occurs at
higher levels (e.g., spinal cord and/or brain), as well as at the sensory receptor level where certain polymodal
sensory receptors can sense diverse sensory signals and integrate them into common signaling pathways. Our
current research seeks a molecular-level understanding of the design principles governing somatosensation and
nociception by membrane sensory receptor channels, as well as their broader contextualization. We also aim to
study disease mutations and develop small molecules targeting these sensory receptors/channels through a
combination of structural, functional, pharmacological, computational biology, chemical biology, and cellular
studies. These studies strive to answer important questions in neurobiology: What is the molecular basis of
somatosensation by sensory receptor channels and can we develop a general model of their activity? How do
mutations in these sensory receptors give rise to neuronal disorders? And, can we develop non-opioid drugs
that target these receptors to treat conditions ranging from chronic itch to migraine?"
10840966,"ABSTRACT
Accounting for more than 60% of cancer survivors, older (≥65 years) cancer survivors, have a 2- to 5-fold risk of
physical function impairment, compared to cancer-free controls. Physical function impairment has multiple
deleterious health effects including poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), multi-morbidity, increased falls,
and all-cause mortality. One strategy to improve physical function is dietary and resistance training interventions,
which improve muscle strength and mass by stimulating muscle protein synthesis. However, there are no
synchronous, online diet and exercise interventions for older cancer survivors, a group at high risk for functional
limitations. Thus, the E-PROOF (E-intervention for Protein Intake and Resistance Training to Optimize Function)
study will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week randomized controlled trial
of an online, tailored nutritional and resistance training education and counseling intervention to improve physical
function and associated health outcomes (muscle strength, HRQoL, self-efficacy, and weight management). We
postulate that, compared to the control group, intervention participants would experience statistically significant,
clinically meaningful improvements in physical function and associated health outcomes following the 12-week
diet and resistance training intervention. To achieve our objective, we will: 1) Determine the feasibility and
acceptability of implementing an online dietary and resistance training intervention among 70 older cancer
survivors; and; 2) Examine the preliminary efficacy of an online dietary and resistance training intervention to
improve physical function and associated outcomes among 70 older cancer survivors who participated in a 12-
week intervention. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, participants will be randomized to one of two groups:
one experimental (online counseling by a registered dietitian and exercise scientist, menus, educational
materials on protein, healthy diet, resistance training) and one control (general survivorship education). We will
examine the intervention effects on physical function, muscle strength, HRQoL, self-efficacy, weight, and waist
circumference during a 12-week period between the experimental and control groups. We will conduct a 3-month
follow-up to assess physical function, muscle strength, and HRQoL. The feasibility of conducting an online diet
and resistance training intervention in older cancer survivors will be determined by the study accrual, retention,
and adherence rates. This study will inform the development of a R01 scale randomized controlled trial to
evaluate the effectiveness of a protein-focused meal delivery program and resistance exercise regimen on risk
for functional impairment and sarcopenia among older cancer survivors. The study goals respond to the NIA and
NCI missions to address the research gaps in older cancer survivors and help them lead longer, healthier lives.
This novel study advances science by promoting independent health behaviors among older cancer survivors,
which can improve health outcomes and provide foundational knowledge to further address this growing problem
on a wider scale through online platforms."
10820424,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In order to ensure more expertise in research ethics to support the rapid increase in research activities
taking place in Malaysia, the Master of Health Research Ethics (MOHRE) program at Universiti Malaya
(UM) was developed in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics (JHU). This
regionally first of its kind health research ethics degree program has now been fully implemented and
accredited and has produced 17 trainees with an additional 8 trainees who will be graduating this year. The
overall goal of our application, Strengthening the Master of Health Research Ethics Training Program, is to
strengthen the MOHRE program and ensure its sustainability by: (1) developing and implementing a more
flexible training program that includes full-time and part-time enrolment options; (2) strengthening the
program guided by a novel, empirically derived research ethics competency framework developed by our
program (FRESCO: Framework for Research Ethics Studies Competencies and Outcomes) and
systematically embedding context-appropriate cases in the curriculum; and (3) enhancing UM faculty’s
capacity in research ethics education and scholarship. Since its inception, the program has sparked interest
among working professionals in bioethics-related fields in Malaysia and the region. However, its current
format is not ideal for professional students who prefer part-time study, course schedules that occur outside
of usual working hours, and more online learning opportunities, which are now in very high-demand due in-
part to the COVID-19 pandemic. With a new format, the program will further produce 26 trainees (21
Malaysians; 5 from regional low- and middle-income countries). We aim to utilise FRESCO and an
eCasebook collated based on regionally relevant cases to further strengthen the program. Finally, we will
conduct a robust faculty development program which will include an annual faculty development workshop
and a structured mentoring program to equip UM faculty members with necessary knowledge and skills to
lead the MOHRE program in the future. In sum, the proposed measures will facilitate our team to expand
health research ethics expertise in Malaysia and other low- and middle-income countries in Southeast Asia.
Eventually, we aspire to establish a regional research ethics network that will include MOHRE alumni as
leaders making meaningful contributions towards the design and conduct of ethically sound health
research."
10810706,"After a stroke, deficits in the control of standing balance contribute to a decreased quality of life, decreased
functional mobility, and an increased risk of falls. Unfortunately, rehabilitation methods that have successfully
reduced fall incidence in older adults (e.g., targeted strengthening exercises, perturbation training) have not yet
shown the same benefits among people with chronic stroke (PwCS). This lack of success is likely due in part to
these interventions not including a component that targets the somatosensory deficits that contribute to losses
of balance and are quite common among PwCS.
The objective of this proposal is to design a novel multisensory augmentation approach to improve the control
of standing balance in PwCS. With sensory augmentation, artificial feedback provides the nervous system with
information about the dynamic state of the body, which can be used to prevent losses of balance. Such
methods have been used to improve balance among individuals with vestibular deficits, primarily by applying
vibratory stimuli to the trunk that provide information about body sway. However, three primary barriers have
prevented the effective use of this approach among PwCS. First, these methods rely on cognitive processing
to interpret and respond to the novel source of feedback, while many PwCS have cognitive deficits. Second,
the focus on a single source of augmented feedback does not account for the extensive variability in how
PwCS respond to sensory stimulation. Finally, it is presently unclear whether sensory augmentation would be
more effectively applied among PwCS as a training tool (i.e., used temporarily during rehabilitation) or as an
assistive tool (i.e., a device worn during daily activities in the community). The proposed study will address
each of these barriers, centered around the hypothesis that targeting somatosensory augmentation toward the
feedback sources that are most useful for an individual patient will improve post-stroke balance performance.
This hypothesis will be addressed through three Specific Aims.
The first Specific Aim is to characterize changes in balance performance with augmented sensory feedback
among PwCS. Four distinct sources of somatosensory feedback will be augmented (trunk tactile sense, hip
proprioception, ankle proprioception, foot sole cutaneous sense), each of which can contribute to the control of
mediolateral balance. The relative effectiveness of each type of augmentation will be quantified for individual
participants, as will the ability to predict this effectiveness from brief sensory perturbations – which would be of
great value in quickly identifying an appropriate augmentation approach. The second Specific Aim is to assess
the feasibility and effectiveness of human-in-the-loop optimization of multisensory augmentation. Given the
many sources of sensory feedback that can contribute to balance control, this use of novel optimization
methods to identify the best stimulation paradigm to improve an individual’s balance would increase the
likelihood of sensory augmentation having an important clinical impact. The third Specific Aim is to determine
whether multisensory augmentation produces sustained balance improvements when applied as either a
training device or as an assistive device. Here, both training effects (e.g., improved balance when
augmentation is not applied) and assistive effects (e.g., continuously improved balance over long periods of
augmentation) will be assessed over the course of a 10-week intervention.
The proposed project has a foundation in the neurophysiology of sensorimotor balance control, applying
sensory augmentation methods that are based on prior rigorous basic science research. This approach will
thus further the field’s understanding of the relationship between sensory feedback and balance, while
simultaneously increasing the probability of providing clinically relevant insight into the important problem of
post-stroke balance deficits."

The overall reduction in the rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) over the past decades in the US has not
extended to young adults aged 18-39 years. An increasing prevalence of CVD risk factors in young adults,
including high blood pressure (BP), likely contributed to the increase in CVD rates. About 20% of US young
adults have stage 1 or 2 hypertension (BP 130-139/80-89 mm Hg and ≥140/90 mm Hg, respectively). Despite
the high prevalence of hypertension in young adults and its association with CVD, there is little evidence to
guide BP screening and treatment recommendations in young adults. For BP screening, >25% of young adults
in the US with hypertension are unaware that they have it. Moreover, social determinants of health (SDOH), an
important influence on the health of young adults, is not considered in BP screening recommendations. For BP
management, the benefits of initiating antihypertensive medications during young adulthood are unknown and
are extrapolated from data among older adults. Due to the lack of evidence, most of the 13 million young adults
with stage 1 hypertension are currently not recommended to initiate antihypertensive medication, and 50% (2.5
million) of young adults with stage 2 hypertension are currently left untreated. Although randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) with hard CVD outcomes will provide definitive evidence, it may not be feasible to perform such a
trial in young adults due to high costs and long follow-up time needed to determine CVD risk reduction
benefits. In the absence of RCTs, high quality observational and simulation studies can provide clinically
relevant and actionable evidence for policy makers, patients, and clinicians in a cost-efficient manner. The
overall study objectives are to determine the optimal BP screening intervals for young adults and to identify
those with a high risk of premature and/or lifetime CVD who may benefit from antihypertensive medication
during young adulthood. The aims of this study are to (1) determine BP screening intervals by examining the
timing of transitioning from normal BP into stage 1 or 2 hypertension and long-term BP trajectories, (2) identify
characteristics of young adults with stage 1 or 2 hypertension who are at high risk for adverse CVD or renal
outcomes, (3) quantify the benefits and harms of antihypertensive medication among young adults with stage 1
or 2 hypertension by emulating a hypothetical RCT using a large observational database and state-of-the-art
statistical models to minimize confounding and selection bias, and (4) compare the short- and long-term health
and economic impact of BP screening and management strategies for US young adults identified in Aims 1 to
3 vs. current BP guidelines. To address these aims, we will study ~500,000 young adults aged 18-39 years
from both Kaiser Permanente Southern California and four epidemiologic cohorts. Findings from this study will
inform future BP guidelines, reduce health inequity by directing screening and treatment to high risk
subgroups, and improve cardiovascular health of US young adults."
10876476,"CELL CYCLE CONTROLS THAT ENSURE GENOME MAINTENANCE (COOK)
SUMMARY
 Our research program seeks insight into the fundamental architecture and regulation of the
human cell division cycle, with specific focus on DNA replication competence. Complete and
efficient duplication of an entire mammalian genome requires that many thousands of DNA
replication origins become licensed in G1 phase through the DNA loading of MCM helicase
complexes. Loaded MCM complexes render genomic loci competent for replication initiation
during S phase. Loss of normal origin licensing control causes genome instability, which can
cause oncogenesis, developmental defects, and degeneration. Origin licensing control is as
important for ensuring normal genome maintenance as companion mechanisms such as
replication fork control and stability or DNA repair, but the regulation of origin licensing is only
partly understood. For example, how is complete origin licensing achieved in cells with
dramatically different G1 lengths, such as during development or after oncogene activation?
How is origin licensing activity distributed in a heterogenous chromatin environment? How is
origin licensing controlled during transitions into and out of the cell cycle? These unanswered
questions preclude the comprehensive understanding of proliferation control needed to
diagnose and treat pathologies in which cell proliferation is a hallmark.
 Our long-term goal is to understand how DNA replication origin licensing is governed by
intracellular and extracellular pathways that control proliferation and development and to
understand the outcomes of perturbations to those controls. Our current and future projects are
organized into scientific questions clustered into two central goals: Goal 1) Define how MCM
loading dynamics regulate G1 progression, Goal 2) Determine the molecular events that
establish and maintain cell cycle exit to quiescence. In recent years, we developed innovative
experimental tools and approaches using quantitative live cell and fixed single cell analyses in
cultured human cells. We combine these tools with molecular genetics and biochemistry. We
focus on uncovering molecular mechanisms and their inter-relationships, and then test the
consequences of perturbing those mechanisms. Our prior efforts produced a consistent stream
of basic scientific discoveries and advances for both the field and the scientific workforce. The
impacts of success towards our central goals are to define previously unexplored mechanisms
in the mammalian cell cycle and to probe the dynamics of molecular events required for genome
maintenance."

Melanoma is the leading cause of skin cancer deaths because it metastasizes efficiently to distant organs.
Metastasis requires significant plasticity for cancer cells to survive the metabolic barriers distinct from the
original primary tumor site including higher oxidative stress, limited nutrient availability, and changing
microenvironments. The specific metabolic changes required for melanoma to undergo this process are poorly
understood. We recently identified a novel suppressor of melanoma metastasis, the enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase, spermatogenic (GAPDHS). We characterized the functional role of GAPDHS in a
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model and demonstrated its impact on glycolysis and pyruvate carboxylase
activity. In this proposal, we will investigate the metabolic changes associated with GAPDHS that drive
metastasis and determine whether its expression can be used to predict tumor progression in melanoma
patients. Specifically, we will determine whether the enzymatic activity of GAPDHS in central glycolysis is
required for suppressing metastasis (Aim 1), if its downstream suppression of pyruvate carboxylase activity
influences metastasis (Aim 2), and whether GAPDHS expression serves as a biomarker of melanoma
metabolism and metastasis in patients (Aim 3). As an Assistant Professor of Dermatology at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, I devote 80% of my time to my research interests under the mentorship
of Dr. Ralph DeBerardinis, with the remaining time dedicated to clinical practice. My goal is to transition to a
career as a successful independent investigator overseeing my own laboratory and research program. To
achieve this, I am seeking a K08 award to provide support for an additional period of mentored research to
gain experience with cancer metabolism, biomarker development, and advanced biostatistics, which are all
necessary to achieve my research goals. With the guidance of a distinguished mentorship committee, I will
have access to the training, resources, and support necessary to establish a successful independent research
program focused on identifying metabolic vulnerabilities in melanoma metastasis."
10647438,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lung adenocarcinoma is a complex disease with high prevalence and mortality. The low survival rate is worsened
by the long-term ineffectiveness of many cancer therapeutics, which eliminate most but not all of the cancer cells
in a tumor. Cellular phenotypic diversity is an important feature of cancer for the fields of basic biology and
medicine, but the mechanisms by which tumors establish and maintain this diversity is poorly understood. One
key aspect of tumor phenotypic diversity is proliferative heterogeneity: the presence of cancer cells that exist in
proliferative states ranging from quiescence to persistent cell division. The Wnt pathway is a potentially important
driver of proliferative heterogeneity, as it is central to the maintenance of a highly proliferative, cancer stem cell-
like state in lung adenocarcinoma. To interrogate proliferative heterogeneity in an unbiased manner, we have
established a novel genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma that enable us to identify
different tumor subpopulations based on proliferative state. We will use this mouse model to isolate highly
proliferative and persistently quiescent cancer cells, which we will then interrogate functionally and
transcriptionally. In these experiments we seek to identify the impact of a cell’s proliferative state on its
tumorigenic capacity (Aim 1). We will also characterize the mechanisms by which distinct proliferative states are
established and maintained. In particular, we will focus on the Wnt pathway to identify the role of individual Wnt
ligands in driving distinct proliferative states. The goal of these experiments is to determine the impact of targeting
Wnt signaling on specific proliferative states and to identify additional cell states with robust growth potential
(Aim 2). Lung cancer has a poor prognosis, but basic science research that improves the understanding of lung
tumor heterogeneity can lead to significant advancements in how patients are treated. Further elucidating the
phenotypic diversity that causes disease relapses may advance our ability to control tumor behavior and increase
the ability of existing cancer treatments to fully eradicate the disease through elimination of resistant cell states."
10824362,"ABSTRACT
An estimated 70% of all eukaryotic cellular proteins are regulated by phosphorylation. Strict temporal and
spatial control are essential for the fidelity of this process, as derailed signaling cascades lead to disease. While
the importance of phosphorylation is clear, knowledge gaps remain in the mechanisms that regulate key
proteins involved in this process, especially phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPP). Our long-term goal is to
understand the structural and functional mechanisms that control PPP activity in health and disease. Here, we
focus on the function of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and PP2A, both of which have major roles in cell division
and cancer. Our aims are designed to define the mechanisms of PP1- and PP2A:B55-based substrate
recruitment to obtain a systems biology understanding of the proteomes and phosphatomes directed by these
enzymes. For the PP2A family of enzymes, it is established that substrates are recruited by their variable B-
subunits. We recently showed that the PP2A B56 subunit binds specifically to its substrates via a newly
identified short linear motif (SLiM), LpSPIxE. This has led to the discovery of scores of novel B56-specific
substrates and the development of the first PP2A:B56-specific regulator. Here, we investigate PP2A:B55, the
most abundant PP2A holoenzyme in cells and the primary enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating CDK1
targets to initiate mitotic exit. Consistent with this, at mitotic entry, PP2A:B55 activity is inhibited. This is
achieved by two B55-specific inhibitors: FAM122A and ARPP19. To molecularly define how these inhibitors
block PP2A:B55 activity and to elucidate the molecular basis of B55 substrate recruitment via a B55-specific
SLiM, we will determine both holoenzyme (quadruple complexes) structures. This is technically challenging, as
these PPPs cannot be functionally expressed in E. coli or insect cells, a problem we have successfully
overcome. Furthermore, we have developed a unique PP1 regulator (PhosTAP), which we show can be
successfully leveraged to fully define the PP1 interactome and phosphatome. Due to its 100% specificity and
exceptional affinity for only PP1, this novel PP1 PhosTAP can also be leveraged to specifically recruit PP1 to
its point of action within the cell, in a manner similar to that used by PROTACs for targeted degradation.
Together, the proposed aims will provide the much-needed molecular data that demonstrate how key PPP
holoenzymes, especially PP1 and PP2A holoenzymes, bind their substrates and how these interactions are
regulated during the cell cycle. Because these holoenzymes have critical roles in multiple human diseases,
especially cancer, the proposed work will establish these holoenzymes specifically, and PPPs generally, as
potent and specific drug targets."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects the majority of people in the world and can cause serious disease in
immunocompromised patients and neonates. The virus establishes life-long latency in bone marrow cells and
disseminates to peripheral organs in quiescently infected monocytes. Antiviral therapy delays virus replication,
but does not eliminate infected cells. Virus rebound, resistance, and drug toxicity complicate treatment and
create a strong demand for improved therapeutics. We advocate that the suppression of HCMV replication must
be in combination with the killing of infected monocytes. We found that HCMV infection of fibroblasts and
monocytes rapidly stimulated the activity of heat shock factor (HSF) 1, a stress-responsive transcription factor,
in a distinct fashion from canonical activation induced by heat shock (HS). Using a novel tool compound called
DTHIB, which has been validated to selectively inhibit HSF1 activity, we found inhibition of HSF1 with DTHIB
attenuated HCMV lytic replication and stimulated death of latently infected monocytes. These studies provide
the beginnings of a proof-of-concept study that HSF1 antagonists may have the capacity to provide the double
“hit” necessary to suppress HCMV replication and eliminate latently infected myeloid cells in a single drug. Thus,
our central hypothesis is that inhibition of HSF1 with the tool compound DTHIB will limit both infection
and spread within an infected host by concomitantly attenuating HCMV lytic replication in permissive
cell types and eliminating latently infected monocytes. The first aim will continue to evaluate the antiviral
potential of DTHIB as an inhibitor of HCMV lytic replication by examining the drug efficacy on different HCMV
permissive cell types, viral strains, and multiplicities of infection (MOIs). We will also conduct transcriptome (RNA
sequencing) analyses and functional studies using DTHIB to identify genes dependent on HCMV-induced HSF1
activity responsible for promoting lytic replication and the impact of DTHIB on the expression of this HCMV-
induced, HSF1-dependent gene profile. The second aim will continue to assess the ability of DTHIB to stimulate
the death of latently infected monocytes by testing the selective drug toxicity on monocytes infected with different
viral strains and at different MOIs. In conjunction, we will perform translatome (polysomal profiling) analyses and
functional studies using DTHIB to identify HSF1-dependent genes responsible for promoting the survival of
latently infected monocytes. The third aim will assess the in vivo antiviral activity of DTHIB on lytic replication,
viral spread, and pathogenesis using a novel murine transplant model with human skin organ, which can
simultaneously monitor HCMV replication in human tissue as well as monitor monocyte-mediated HCMV spread
to distal sites."
10795083,"Project Summary/Abstract
 RNA viruses frequently undergo recombination, and the resulting deletions and duplications in both
genomic and subgenomic RNA can contribute to the viral lifecycle, pathogenesis, and immune evasion. While
recombination has been studied for some viruses, including mosquito-borne flaviviruses, its role in tick-borne
flaviviruses is unknown. This project will investigate RNA recombination, deletions, and duplications in Powassan
virus, which is an emerging flavivirus that is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis ticks, causes severe encephalitis,
and has been detected in the United States with increasing frequency. The long-term objective of this work is to
understand the biological role of recombination in tick-borne virus infection.
 The goals of the current project are to comprehensively characterize the types, genomic locations, and
host-specific patterns of RNA recombination in Powassan virus. The first Aim is to map recombination junctions,
deletions, and duplications in Powassan virus RNA collected from wild-caught Ixodes scapularis ticks. The
investigators will use laboratory and analysis methods specifically designed for detecting recombination:
ClickSeq for library preparation and ViReMa for analysis. They will sequence samples from an existing biobank
of RNA from over 100 Powassan-positive ticks, representing a range of geography and genetic diversity.
Recombination junctions common to multiple samples are hypothesized to represent biologically meaningful
RNA species, such as structural variants (functional RNA molecules important in the viral lifecycle) or defective
RNAs, dysfunctional RNA molecules that may inhibit wild-type virus replication or modify immune signaling.
Evaluating the role of these RNA species in pathogenesis or transmission will be the focus of future projects.
 The second Aim of the current project is to assess whether there are host-specific patterns in RNA
recombination, as vectorborne viruses must replicate in both arthropod and mammalian hosts throughout their
lifecycle. First, the investigators will use a Powassan virus infectious clone to infect tick and mammalian cell
lines, and carefully measure recombination both intracellularly and extracellularly. They will compare the amount
of recombination, including deletions and duplications, and the specific recombination junctions, between host
cell types. Finally, the investigators will use the infectious clone of Powassan virus to infect mice and nymphal
ticks in order to assess whether observed patterns of recombination are reproducible in vivo.
 Overall, this work will provide critical insight into the currently-understudied role of recombination in
Powassan virus, a representative emerging tick-borne flavivirus. Some recombinant species, such as defective
RNAs, are currently being investigated for therapeutic benefit in other viruses, and thus this project may
ultimately contribute to antiviral treatment of tick-borne flaviviruses. Importantly, these foundational studies will
lay the groundwork for future investigation of the biological role of recombination in the lifecycle, pathogenesis,
and immune evasion of tickborne flaviviruses, an important global source of human disease."
10796998,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus infection in otherwise healthy adults and children is a significant cause of morbidity,
mortality, and economic loss. Recurrence of infection is common, highlighting the fact that S. aureus subverts
the development of protective immunity. The development of a vaccine to prevent S. aureus infection has been
a premier goal in the field for over two decades, yet multiple human vaccine candidates have failed in clinical
trials. Understanding the pathogen and host-specific factors that modulate susceptibility to S. aureus infection is
expected to provide insight to advance vaccine design and implementation, but also affords an opportunity to
develop specific bedside-accessible tools for objectively assessing individual patient risk. Such tools are required
to advance the field toward the goals of personalized and precision medicine. Extensive research, including our
own studies, supports the targeting of S. aureus α-toxin (Hla) as a virulence factor to protect against infection.
The interaction of Hla with its eukaryotic receptor ADAM10 provides an additional window of opportunity to
evaluate whether host-specific factors that modify ADAM10 expression or cellular activity impact susceptibility
to S. aureus disease. We have successfully leveraged human clinical studies of S. aureus-infected children and
experimental perturbation of ADAM10 in a mouse model system to examine whether a single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the ADAM10 promoter (rs653765) alters susceptibility to S. aureus infection. Two
complementary lines of data provide initial insight that this SNP is of functional relevance: 1) children with the
rs653765 GG genotype display a significant reduction in odds ratio of invasive S. aureus infection; 2) engineered
SNP variants of ADAM10 in novel mouse lines reflect the initial clinical findings observed in humans harboring
the rs653765 GG genotype, and suggest that the SNP type influences susceptibility to skin and soft tissue
infection. In this project, we propose to leverage existing human genomic DNA biospecimens from an ongoing
study of pediatric immunity to S. aureus infection to fully characterize the impact of ADAM10 rs653765 SNP
variation in susceptibility to S. aureus infection. We will pair this analysis with hypothesis-driven studies to define
the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the rs653765 SNP alters host susceptibility to disease. These
studies which sit at the intersection of human genetic epidemiology and mechanistic research afford a rare
opportunity to define a focused biomarker that can inform an understanding of risk for S. aureus disease. The
successful completion of these studies would provide an unparalleled opportunity to utilize SNP typing to
advance personalized care in the context of infectious disease."

Our goal is to improve control of cardiovascular (CV) disease risk factors using a multilevel intervention
leveraging cellphone-based text messages integrated within health systems to improve control of American
Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) lifestyle factors (blood glucose, cholesterol, blood pressure, physical
activity, weight, diet, and smoking). When uncontrolled, these lifestyle factors lead to common co-existing
chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), morbidity, health care costs and death. Patients who
experience health disparities (i.e., ethnic minorities, those with limited English proficiency and those with low-
income) are disproportionately affected by CV diseases, have worse disease control and suffer greater
sequelae.
Self-management is an individual’s role in managing chronic disease and has strong evidence of benefit. It
includes self-care, lifestyle changes (e.g., increase physical activity), taking medications as prescribed and
managing exacerbations of chronic condition(s). Text messaging interventions have improved health behaviors
including physical activity and medication adherence. Incorporating behavioral “nudges,” defined as a small
change in choice architecture that “alters people’s behavior in a predictable way” into text messages may
further augment its impact. Behavioral nudges are more personalized, resonate better with patients, and have
changed health behaviors. However, text message interventions have typically not been delivered to large
samples, focused on patients experiencing health disparities, nor leveraged health system electronic health
record (EHR) data to personalize content and maximize scale, reach and impact of messages.
Using a patient-level randomized pragmatic trial, we will test the comparative effectiveness of 3 text messaging
delivery strategies: 1) generic text messages; 2) interactive AI chatbot text messaging leveraging evidenced-
based communication strategies with attention to patient context and sociocultural factors influencing self-
management; or 3) interactive AI chatbot text messaging plus proactive pharmacist management. We plan to
enroll 6,000 patients from clinics within 3 health systems that care for large populations experiencing health
disparities: 1) Denver Health and Hospital Authority, 2), Salud Family Health Centers and 3) STRIDE
Community Health Center. We will use health system EHR data to identify eligible patients, deliver the
intervention, and assess patient-centered outcomes. The study findings will provide evidence regarding the
best population-based strategy for universal delivery to engage all patients with health disparities in self-
management to improve the AHA’s LS7. The intervention will be delivered in real world settings to augment
routine clinical care and improve access to care. We will incorporate lessons learned from one health system
into adaptations for the other health systems in the study."
10893444,"PROJECT SUMMARY
MYC is an oncoprotein transcription factor that features prominently in cancer. As a transcription factor, the
ability of MYC to recognize its target genes is paramount to its activity. The long-standing paradigm for how
MYC selects its targets is that it dimerizes with MAX, forming a module that binds specific DNA sequences
in the regulatory elements of target genes. In recent years, however, it has become clear that target gene
recognition by MYC can also depend on additional chromatin-resident proteins that act through avidity to
direct MYC:MAX dimers to specific sites in the genome. This 'facilitated recruitment' process is poorly
understood, although it likely influences a majority of MYC binding to chromatin in cancer cells. Detailed
mechanistic studies of facilitated recruitment are needed to understand this most basic aspect of MYC
activity, and are timely because, unlike MYC, these recruiters may be amenable to drug discovery,
unlocking new ways to target MYC in the clinic. This project explores the mechanisms and significance of
facilitated recruitment of MYC to chromatin by WDR5, a conserved nuclear protein that is an active target
for drug discovery by numerous groups. WDR5 recruits MYC to chromatin at genes vital for protein
synthesis, including a collection of ribosomal protein genes and genes encoding translation factors and
nucleolar RNAs. Disrupting interaction of MYC with WDR5 in a preexisting malignancy promotes rapid and
irreversible tumor collapse, indicating that the MYC–WDR5 nexus can be pharmacologically inhibited as a
treatment for MYC-driven cancers. Aim 1 of this project uses a combination of high resolution genetic,
genomic, and proteomic approaches to characterize the fundamental mechanisms that bring MYC and
WDR5 together on chromatin, and to reveal the extent to which facilitated recruitment by WDR5—and other
recruiters—determines the genes that are controlled by MYC in cancer cells. Aim 2 blends genetic,
genomic, and in vivo studies to probe the importance of the MYC–WDR5 connection in a diverse set of
cancer contexts, and to reveal precisely how targeting this connection promotes tumor regression. These
studies will lead to a new and robust paradigm for the mechanisms of target gene selection by MYC, identify
novel and targetable vulnerabilities in the MYC network, and show how gene-selective recruiters such as
WDR5 can be exploited to therapeutically inhibit MYC. Importantly, these studies will also lay the biological
groundwork for the implementation of WDR5 inhibitors in the clinic as anti-MYC agents."

As access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has expanded and people live longer with HIV, HCV mortality has
increased. The burden is particularly high in people who inject drugs (PWID). However, HCV can be cured with
highly efficacious medications resulting in calls for microelimination. In settings with key population-focused
HIV epidemics, microelimination may be achieved by integrating HCV services with existing HIV and harm
reduction services to simultaneously improve HIV and HCV outcomes. Our team has successfully scaled
integrated care centers (ICCs) for PWID across India. ICCs provide vertically integrated, HIV prevention and
treatment services in stand-alone stigma-free venues. We integrated HCV point-of-care testing in 2015 and
demonstrated significant improvements in HCV testing and awareness. However, HCV treatment remains a
missing component. Accordingly, we investigate the impact of the integration of HCV treatment with individually
tailored treatment support into 7 PWID focused ICCs. Our Aims are to: Aim 1: Evaluate whether individual
treatment outcomes in HCV mono- and HIV/HCV co-infected PWID can be optimized by tailoring treatment
support in 7 PWID-focused integrated HIV/HCV prevention/treatment centers. Subaim 1A: Compare sustained
virologic response (SVR) in PWID undergoing DAA-based HCV therapy randomized by a “precision clinical
trial” approach to varying levels (low, medium, high) of treatment support tailored to need using an algorithm
based on factors associated with early HIV viral suppression. Subaim 1B: Estimate the incidence of HCV-
reinfection by HIV status among PWID achieving SVR. Subaim 1C: Evaluate the impact of HCV cure on HIV
viral suppression among HIV/HCV co-infected PWID. Aim 2: Characterize barriers and facilitators to
integration of HCV treatment with tailored treatment support and HIV services through a mixed-methods
evaluation to facilitate implementation in other settings. Aim 3: Estimate population-level effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of integrating HCV testing and treatment with essential HIV prevention and treatment
services. Subaim 3A: Assess the observed and future impact of integrated HCV/HIV testing and treatment on
chronic HCV and HIV prevalence and incidence among PWID using epidemic modeling and serosurvey data.
Subaim 3B: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of integrated HCV/HIV testing and treatment and identify the most
cost-effective HCV treatment support strategies. To achieve these aims, we will scale on-site HCV testing and
treatment in 7 ICCs across India that already deliver essential HIV services to ~10,000 PWID. Treatment
support will be personalized using an algorithm based on early HIV viral suppression to triage clients into two
strata: minimal and elevated risk for failure. Using a novel unbalanced randomization approach, we will assess
efficacy of low (self-administered), medium (peer navigator) and high intensity (DOT) treatment support
strategies within strata of treatment failure risk and overall. Population outcomes including reduced
transmission will be evaluated through cross-sectional surveys, epidemic and cost-effectiveness modeling."
10914124,"Bacterial virulence is closely associated with nutrient acquisition, which is essential for growth and proliferation
of pathogens. Metal ions constitute essential nutrients, and the regulation of bacterial metal ion homeostasis
within the host environment plays a pivotal role; however, unbound essential metal ions exhibit low bioavailability.
For instance, the low solubility of Fe(OH)3 (Ksp = 6.3 x 10-38) at pH 7.4 would result in an insufficient quantity of
iron for bacteria to grow, thus bacteria rely on targeting the hosts’ labile iron reserves through synthesis of
endogenous, hydrophilic metallophores that are internalized using ATP-dependent bacterial transmembrane
shuttles. These metallophores also retain affinity for non-essential xenometal ions with identical charge,
comparable ionic radius and chemical hardness to the essential metal ion. For instance, trivalent metal ions with
similar ionic radius to high spin Fe3+ (0.78 Å), such as Ga3+ (0.76 Å), Sc3+ (0.87 Å) and In3+ (0.93 Å) are
transported to the bacterial peri- and cytoplasm when coordinated by bacterial iron-metallophores such as
enterobactin or desferioxamine. These xenometals cannot be utilized for desired biological functions; recent
strategies to utilize bacterial metal homeostasis pathways to deliver therapeutics has resulted in renewed interest
in xenometals as alternative antibiotics.
In bacteria, iron’s cytoplasmic fate and influence on gene and protein regulation is well-understood; however,
xenometal homeostasis and utilization, especially in light of differential pH-dependent speciation behavior,
remains rudimentary. To this end, we seek to investigate the following questions: (1) Are M3+-metallophore
complexes efficiently recognized and transported across bacterial membranes? Size, hardness and Lewis acidity
of metal ions influence their coordination complex structure. Substantial divergence from the parent Fe3+ complex
results in diminished transport efficiency. We will study xenometal complex speciation under physiological
conditions and employ a photoreactive tagging strategy to identify transmembrane shuttle protein interaction. (2)
(How) Does M3+ release from metallophores proceed in absence of accessible redox events? Fe3+ is released
by reduction to Fe2+ and enzymatic degradation of the metallophore induced by Fe2+-dependent proteins. The
xenometals of interest, Ga3+, Sc3+ and In3+, do not have accessible redox events under physiological conditions.
We will employ a radiochemical labeling strategy to track their metallophore-mediated uptake and identify
metabolites. (3) What is the fate of M3+ xenometals in the cytoplasm and their influence on protein expression?
The fate of non-redox active xenometals, once they reach the bacterial cytoplasm, including their effect on the
bacterial protein expression is not well understood but hold the key to their growth inhibitory activity. We will
combine radiochemical tagging strategies with mass spectrometry isolate and identify xenometal-target proteins.
We will assess and quantitate the change in bacterial metabolites following exposure to different xenometal-
metallophore complexes, which will inform on altered bacterial metabolism."

The goal of the NYU Melanoma SPORE Core B (Biospecimen Procurement & Utilization Core) is to stimulate
patient-centered melanoma translational research by providing all NYU Melanoma SPORE investigators—
including research project co-leaders, Career Enhancement Program (CEP) awardees, and Developmental
Research Program (DRP) awardees—with both: 1) access to high-quality melanoma biospecimens linked to
prospectively collected clinical and pathological data, and 2) innovative services that promote the aims of those
projects. Core B will maintain and expand the clinicopathological data and corresponding biospecimen (tissue,
blood, and stool) resources of the NYU Melanoma Clinicopathological-Biospecimen Database and Repository
for the SPORE’s study of resected and unresectable metastatic melanoma patients. To execute the central
scientific strategy of the NYU Melanoma SPORE, Core B will coordinate with industry partners to ensure the
acquisition, processing, and distribution of nearly 10,000 human biospecimens from melanoma patients enrolled
in multi-site phase III clinical trials. Core B will process biospecimens, including performing nucleic acid extraction
and T-cell isolation, and provide specialized, innovative pathology services to support the aims of full SPORE
research projects, CEP projects, and DRP projects. Through a governance committee, Core B will also provide
oversight of SPORE biospecimen use. Building on the NYU Melanoma Clinicopathological-Biospecimen
Database and Repository’s infrastructure, biospecimen resources, and extensive support of NYU Melanoma
Program studies internally and with other institutions, Core B will stimulate collaborations within the NYU
Melanoma SPORE community as well as with outside collaborators, including other currently active Melanoma
and Skin Cancer SPOREs.
Given the considerable translational research infrastructure and resources at NYU, Core B personnel will also
work closely with the Administrative Core to ensure the most efficient use of institutional resources without
replication of efforts.
Overall, Core B will provide high quality, annotated melanoma patient biospecimens to all SPORE studies to
support the NYU Melanoma SPORE’s mission to develop clinically impactful prognostic and predictive
biomarkers for the personalized management of resectable melanoma patients."

Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) adjuvant therapies—including ipilimumab (IPI; targets cytotoxic T lymphocyte-
antigen 4) and nivolumab (NIVO; targets programmed death protein 1)—increase relapse-free survival (RFS) in
melanoma patients. Nonetheless, 35–40% of these patients relapse within 24 months after completing ICI
therapy, and no biomarkers—either alone or together—can predict RFS after ICI therapy and potentially identify
novel targets for more effective adjuvant treatments. Efforts to identify biomarkers of ICI efficacy have centered
mainly on the tumor microenvironment in the metastatic setting, leaving putative biomarkers of adjuvant ICI
treatments largely unexplored. Because anti-tumor T-cell immunity is the primary target of ICI, the focus has
been predominantly on tumor T-cell infiltration. Here we propose the novel hypothesis that underlying
inherited factors that influence host immunity impact RFS after adjuvant ICI. It has been demonstrated that
phenotypic variation in T-cell subsets, including CD8+ T cells, can be attributed to germline genetic variation. In
a recent study, we showed that this inherited component maps to the non-coding regulatory genome, impacting
transcriptional regulation of T-cell differentiation and function. Based on these data, we hypothesize that germline
genetic variation in the T-cell-specific non-coding regulatory genome (regulome) controls circulating CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells (the primary targets of NIVO and NIVO+IPI ICI), and that this genetic variability is associated with
RFS after ICI treatment. We propose to discover inherited signatures of the CD4+- and CD8+- T-cell regulome
that predict ICI relapse and RFS. Using samples from 600 melanoma patients treated in an adjuvant clinical trial
of NIVO compared to NIVO+IPI, we will perform whole-genome (WGS) and whole-transcriptome sequence
analyses of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood collected before ICI treatment to identify non-coding
transcriptome signatures that predict RFS after adjuvant ICI (Aim 1). We will also comprehensively assess open
chromatin states in pre-treatment CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from the same 600 patients to identify epigenetic
signatures controlled by inherited genetic variation, and predict RFS after adjuvant ICI (Aim 2), and integrate
these data with microbiome, immuno-phenotyping, and seromics profiles from Project 1 (Aim 3). Our preliminary
data have revealed novel genomic imprints in the non-coding regulome that predict ICI response with high clinical
accuracy, thus substantially supporting our hypotheses and study design. For the first time, we will elucidate the
effect of inherited anti-tumor host immunity on ICI outcomes in the adjuvant setting. Besides having applicability
to personalized prediction of ICI benefit, the integration of genomic information from all three aims of this project
promises to reveal novel T-cell-specific transcriptional networks that potentially affect ICI resistance and might
serve as targets for improved adjuvant ICI therapies in melanoma and other cancers."
11196469,"PROJECT 3 SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed melanoma treatment, producing durable responses, prolonged
survival, and clinical benefit in a significant proportion of patients. Moreover, they delay recurrence and extend
survival in the adjuvant melanoma setting, and have also shown efficacy in a range of different cancer types.
However, immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) therapy can also be accompanied by immune-related adverse
events (irAEs) that impact multiple organs, cause significant morbidity, and require immunosuppression or
discontinuation of ICI treatment. There is an urgent need to identify patients who will develop severe irAEs from
ICI. This would enable us to optimize treatment selection and sequencing, justify preventive strategies to mitigate
toxicity, and better manage toxicities. While there is intense interest in identifying markers to predict response to
ICI, no pre-treatment biomarker tool can predict irAEs associated with ICI for any cancer type. The goal of our
project is to develop a predictive tool that enables clinicians to minimize exposure of patients to severe
toxicity, while maximizing clinical benefit from ICI.
We hypothesize that a subset of melanoma patients has a baseline, sub-clinical autoimmune
susceptibility, characterized by specific pre-existing autoantibodies (autoAbs) that can predict and
exacerbate the development of toxicity from ICI therapy. We have identified autoAb signatures in baseline
(pre-treatment) sera that predict severe immune toxicity in melanoma patients treated with ICI (AUC >0.95).
Using a humanized mouse model, we found that autoAbs from baseline sera of melanoma patients can
exacerbate irAEs from ICI. In this project, we propose to refine and validate baseline autoAb biomarker
signatures of ICI toxicity using sera (n=600) from two large adjuvant ICI clinical trials for resected stage-III/IV
melanoma (Aim 1). To understand the relevance of specific autoAbs to common irAEs (e.g., colitis) and to
investigate an autoimmune predisposition in some patients, we will compare irAE-associated autoAbs with those
from inflammatory bowel disease patients and from normal donors. We will use our humanized FcR mouse
model to determine the cause-effect relationship between autoAbs and irAEs, with a focus on colitis, and for
preclinical testing of prophylactic anti-TNF- as a strategy to mitigate gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity from ICI (Aim
2). These findings will inform a biomarker-driven phase-II trial of prophylactic anti-TNF- (infliximab) in patients
receiving ICI therapy who are at high risk for developing severe diarrhea and colitis (Aim 3).
Our work will inform personalized melanoma treatment strategies by validating a robust pre-treatment biomarker
to enable clinicians to optimize ICI regimens and minimize patient exposure to severe irAEs. We will both identify
an autoimmune susceptibility to irAE development and establish whether prophylactic TNF- blockade mitigates
development of GI toxicity from ICI in patients identified as being at high risk of these irAEs."
10818536,"Project summary
 Somatic mutations accumulate in normal tissues and are increasingly recognized as a crucial
determinant of disease risk, especially in age-related conditions and cancer. Somatic mutations show
enrichment in portions of the noncoding genome that show “open” chromatin structure, such as active
promoter and enhancer elements, because open chromatin is more vulnerable to mutagens. Furthermore,
transcription factors binding appears to obstruct DNA repair, increasing the likelihood of forming fixed, double-
stranded mutations. The channeling effects of these mechanisms result in a concentration of somatic
mutations in restricted, yet critical, regions of the genome. Somatic mutations with an increased likelihood of
causing diseases frequently arise at recurrent genomic sites, and often even recurrent mutations at specific
bases, allowing for the development of targeted methods with greater sensitivity, lower cost, and higher
throughput to identify somatic mutations than traditional sequencing techniques.
 Present methods for identifying somatic mutations generally utilize deep (≥250X) whole genome
sequencing (WGS) and tend to be expensive, create large datasets that are computationally challenging to
analyze, and have limited ability to detect somatic variants with very low allele fractions. We propose a two
phase approach to developing a new tool to address these shortcomings. In the first phase we will develop a
method of detecting somatic mutations using ATAC-seq. ATAC-seq targets the open chromatin regions of the
genome so is focused on regions with increased somatic mutations that have an increased likelihood of being
biologically meaningful, only incorporates a fraction of the genome creating a more manageable dataset, and
allows for deeper sequencing to increase the sensitivity of somatic mutation detection. This phase of the
proposal includes three aims: modification of the ATAC-seq protocol to allow for detection of somatic
mutations; development of analysis software to analyze the data; and testing of the protocol.
 In the second phase of the protocol, data obtained from phase one will be used to develop a panel
sequencing protocol to further narrow the genomic regions looked at, reduce the cost of the analysis, and allow
for extracted DNA to be directly analyzed (rather than the intact chromatin needed for ATAC-seq). This phase
will also involve three aims: expansion of ATAC-seq analysis to determine the best regions to include on the
sequencing panel; development of the sequencing panel; and testing of the panel on a range of individuals and
tissue types.
 This project will provide rapid and inexpensive methods for the detection of potentially critical somatic
mutations in any tissue type. At a research level, it will allow for the analysis of a large number of samples to
provide critical information on biologically important somatic mutations and thus be an important tool that will
help illuminate the spectrum of somatic mutation in the noncoding genome."

 The overarching goals of this project are to illuminate the nature and functions of episodic memory by
examining how retrieval of episodic memories supports cognitive functions that extend beyond simple recall of
past events, such as imagining future experiences, solving everyday problems, and making inferences about the
links among related events. Recent evidence indicates that the same core brain network is involved in both
remembering past experiences and imagining or simulating hypothetical future experiences. The proposed
experiments will use novel cognitive tasks and neuroscience-based measures, including both functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), to elucidate how specific
regions within this core network support constructive uses of episodic retrieval that underly future thinking,
problem solving, and associative inferences. The studies will also examine how some of these adaptive
functions can also lead to errors in episodic remembering.
 One set of studies will use a novel fMRI pattern similarity approach to clarify how two key regions in the
core brain network – the hippocampus and angular gyrus – reinstate episodic information from past
experiences when people imagine various kinds of future experiences. TMS will provide converging evidence
by targeting hippocampal activity, which should specifically impact episodic reinstatement. A second set of
studies will use a similar combination of fMRI pattern similarity and TMS approaches to revealing, for the first
time, how episodic information is reinstated when people try to address everyday personal problems, including
problems that are personally worrisome. These studies will draw on novel behavioral paradigms that recruit
episodic retrieval processes during personal problem solving. A third set of experiments will attempt to identify
the neural mechanisms underlying memory errors that result from adaptive use of episodic retrieval processes
that support the ability to make associative inferences about the relations among events by combining novel
behavioral paradigms with fMRI pattern similarity analysis.
 Overall, these experiments should enhance understanding of mechanisms involved in episodic retrieval,
simulation, and problem solving by helping to refine recently novel measures developed in recent research, and
could also provide insights that are relevant to clinical conditions in which episodic retrieval and simulation
deficits contribute to impairments in everyday cognitive function."

Candidate’s Long-Term Career Goal: To become an independent investigator who uses advanced
observational research methods to improve the organization and delivery of critical care.
Clinical Problem to be Addressed: Acute respiratory failure leads to 2,000,000 hospitalizations and 400,000
deaths in the US each year. Outcomes vary widely across hospitals, suggesting that improvements to how
care is organized and delivered may improve survival. Yet, global changes affecting inpatient care teams have
encouraged fragmentation—discontinuous care spread across multiple physicians. Little is known about how
fragmented care affects adults with respiratory failure and what hospitals can do to protect patients from harm.
Specific Aims: Using advanced methods for causal inference applied to novel data sources, Dr. Admon will 1)
compare the causal effects of fragmented care on in-hospital and post-hospital respiratory failure outcomes; 2)
determine whether specific complications occur more often in fragmented care and predict poorer outcomes;
and 3) test whether specific features of inpatient care are protective against harm when care is fragmented.
Candidate’s Background: Dr. Andrew Admon is a Lecturer and Research Fellow in Pulmonary and Critical
Care Medicine at the University of Michigan. He has advanced training in public health and health care
research. He has 25 total publications, including 17 original research manuscripts, with 7 original research
manuscripts as first author. Dr. Admon’s work is supported by an NHLBI NRSA F32 award.
Career Development Plan: To meet his long-term career goal, Dr. Admon seeks deep, focused training in
causal inference and survey methodology. Accordingly, his 5-year plan includes curated courses that build on
his strong foundation in quantitative research, project-based mentoring by experts in critical care epidemiology,
causal inference, and survey research, selected career development activities, and specific milestones to
ensure a successful transition to independence. Dr. Admon’s primary mentor is Colin Cooke, MD, MS, MSc.
His co-mentors are Andrew Ryan, PhD, Sarah Krein, PhD, RN, and Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD.
Deliverables: Completing the research and training in this proposal will generate data informing strategies to
mitigate fragmentation while equipping Dr. Admon with advanced skills in observational causal inference and
survey methods. In subsequent work, this expertise will prepare him to maximally leverage observational data
to generate timely and accurate evidence addressing other research challenges in critical care delivery."

Synaptic connections determine how neural circuits process information. Understanding how the strength and
specificity of these connections is established is a central challenge in neurobiology. In many parts of the
developing mammalian brain, stereotyped patterns of stimulus-independent neuronal activity precede sensory-
driven responses. Whether and how this developmental activity guides synapse assembly at the level of
defined cell types and circuits is not well-understood. Here, much of the challenge is due to the size and
complexity of the mammalian brain itself: Even in the retina, where developmental activity is best
characterized, the technical barriers to pursuing synapse level questions are significant. We recently
discovered analogous patterned, stimulus-independent neural activity (PSINA, pronounced `see-nah') in the
developing Drosophila brain. With the ever-growing knowledge of its neurobiology, spanning the connectome
to behavior, the fly is unmatched in its promise for cell type- and circuit- level studies. PSINA is globally
coordinated with brain-wide, periodic active and silent phases. In the visual system, each cell type participates
in PSINA with distinct and stereotyped spatio-temporal patterns of activity. These developmental activity
patterns are correlated between pairs of neurons known to be synaptic partners in the adult. Our long term
goal is to test the hypothesis that the cell-type-specific activity patterns of PSINA refine the emerging
connectome to generate wild-type synaptic strength and specificity. Here, we will work toward this goal by
leveraging a new genetic handle on PSINA: Trpγ, a cation channel with a weak preference for Ca2+, is required
for wild-type PSINA. In trpγ mutants, the amplitude of activity is reduced by >50% across the whole brain, and
cell-type-specific activity patterns and synapse numbers are altered. Trpγ is expressed in <1.5% of the
neurons in the brain. Notably, silencing only these neurons by overexpressing a hyperpolarizing channel
attenuates PSINA by >90%. This indicates that some or all of this diverse group of ~1,700 Trpγ-expressing (i.e.
Trpγ+) neurons are critical to coordinating PSINA in the developing brain. We hypothesize that Trpγ+ neurons
are the source of the cell-type-specific activity patterns. In Aim 1, we will identify individual Trpγ+ neurons that
innervate the visual system and test if these neurons specify the activity patterns of their post-synaptic
partners. Determining the origin of these patterns will allow us to ask whether they are the cause or
consequence of synapse and circuit maturation. In Aim 2, we will focus on a specific neuron that is part of the
well-studied motion detection circuit and ask if the strength of its post-synaptic contacts are altered in trpγ
mutants. Identifying the cellular origin of the activity patterns and understanding the effect of PSINA on
synaptic development will allow us to reversibly silence, alter, or possibly re-program PSINA. With this
knowledge, we will be able to define the contribution of developmental activity to the structural and functional
maturation of synapses and circuits, to sensory processing, to learning, memory, and behavior."

The heightened vulnerability to COVID-19 of African American older adults in Detroit, Michigan and other
marginalized communities is linked to systemic racism experienced over the life course. Structural inequities
also magnify the pandemic's impact on older adults' physical and psychosocial functioning. For example, social
isolation is exacerbated by widespread digital exclusion, and closures of community centers leave few safe
options for physical activity. Hence, many older adults in Detroit, burdened by poor health even before the
pandemic, face a downward spiral of increased distress, reduced physical and social activity, and physical
deconditioning. Timely intervention is critical to prevent or slow this decline. “Positive STEPS” is a self-
management and resilience-building intervention led by community health workers (CHWs) at the Detroit
Health Department (DHD). CHWs have a unique ability to reach underserved groups, provide culturally
congruent care, and form a bridge to formal services; yet they have been vastly underutilized during the
pandemic. This intervention targets individual (self-management, resilience), interpersonal (social support) and
community (enhanced DHD capacity) levels. The long-term goal of this research is to build an evidence base
for engaging the CHW workforce to mitigate the pandemic's impact on vulnerable groups. The project's
objective is to assess the impact of Positive STEPS on functional outcomes. The central hypothesis is that
Positive STEPS, delivered via a synchronous group telephone platform, asynchronous podcast series, and
activity trackers, will improve psychosocial and physical functioning at 2 and 8 months. In an ongoing
randomized pilot trial, a version of Positive STEPS has been well-received and delivered by CHWs with high
fidelity. In analysis to date of post-program outcomes, the intervention group (n=16) has shown clinically
significant improvements of 2 to 5 points across PROMIS domains of physical functioning, anxiety, depression,
fatigue and pain interference, while controls (n=18) are unchanged or worse. The DHD will work with other City
of Detroit units to recruit participants with elevated physical or psychological symptoms. Specific aims are: 1)
With input from a Community Advisory Board, modify Positive STEPS for group delivery and add pandemic
content; conduct a mini-pilot (n=10). 2) Conduct an RCT to assess its impact (vs. COVID education/telephone
wellness check) on PROMIS-29 Psychosocial Score (a weighted combination of distress, fatigue, pain, social
participation and sleep) among 456 primarily African American older adults. 3) Using qualitative data from
participants and other stakeholders, conduct mixed-methods analyses to provide context for Aim 2 findings,
assess community impact, and inform a dissemination toolkit. This project is significant in that it will rigorously
test a scalable model for addressing sequelae of the pandemic among older adults in a deeply disadvantaged
setting. It is innovative in that it tests a unique blend of CHW support with broadly-accessible mobile health
tools. Last, it has potential for broad impact, given the model's transferability to other vulnerable populations."

Huntington Disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the loss of striatal neurons in the
central nervous system and is associated with progressive unwanted choreatic movements, behavioral and
psychiatric disturbances, and dementia1,2. HD is caused by CAG triplet repeat expansions in the first exon of
the HTT gene which codes for huntingtin protein, resulting in an expanded stretch of glutamines (polyQ). HD
affects all ethnic groups with an average incidence of ~5 per 100,000 people, though the prevalence can vary
by ~10 fold among populations. There is currently no cure or effective treatment for HD and while some
therapeutic interventions may lessen the severity of patient symptoms, HD typically results in fatality within 10-
30 years of disease onset.
In this follower project, we aim to improve HD protein expression to enable rescue of disease progression in HD
patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Optimize base editing and prime editing strategies to correct HD repeat
expansion; (2) Optimize AAV delivery for base and prime editor-mediated correction of the HD expansion in
mice; (3) Conduct pre-clinical studies at scale (JAX). We will work closely with the Gene Editing Core to develop
the latest base editing and/or prime editing technologies in HD model systems. We will iterate with the Gene
Editing Core to ensure that our genome editing tools maximize on-target editing efficiencies, minimize
undesirable gene editing byproducts and off-target editing events, and maximize compatibility with in vivo
delivery methods of potential therapeutic relevance."

considerable expertise in matching the underlying toxicology of targeted exposure biomarkers to the study
design, to the biological specimen types collected, and to the health phenotypes measured. We also factor in
subject age, occupation and the exposure scenarios. Our lab feasibility assessments help shape the science of
a client's submission towards higher impact studies. We also counsel clients on preventing the use of precious
samples on assays that are deemed likely to be below detection limits (e.g. measuring organophosphate
pesticide metabolites in suburban populations) based on our many years of research experience and
understanding of exposure scenarios. We work with the Administrative Core to coordinate services, including
sample management, receiving, labeling and tracking. We serve as expert consultants with the Coordinating
Center, PI/Clients and other HHEAR Resources. We collaborate with the Data Center in the management of
results reporting, ensuring that data are properly formatted and have sufficient metadata, as well as participate
in the analysis of exposure/phenotype relationships. We use automated robotic sample handling and
preparation methods, high throughput analytical procedures and state of the art inter-laboratory QA/QC
procedures which include real time chromatography monitoring and database management through state-of-
the-art laboratory information management system (LIMS) software. We also automated data processing to
reduce human error. Our methods ensure proper sample tracking and data reporting and avoid mismatches of
samples to results. With substantial institutional resources at its disposal, the Targeted Resource has doubled
the number of mass spectrometry instruments to 14 in the last 3 years, ensuring the capacity to best serve the
needs of the HHEAR Network. Our team also conducts extensive outreach and was the only CHEAR lab hub
to organize a National Exposure Biomarker Symposium (held Nov 2-3, 2018 at Mount Sinai and themed on
Exposomics) as described in the Administrative Core. QA/QC protocols and standard operating procedures for
all target compounds have been established to maintain the rigor of our chemical analyses. We developed
panels for elements and organic chemicals that in sum assess more than 200 chemicals. We participated in all
CHEAR mandated QA/QC and PT programs for metals and organic chemicals to verify our precision and
accuracy and will do so for HHEAR. In sum, we process and analyze samples with a high degree of efficiency
and accuracy, provide expert scientific consultation and integrate our work on targeted exposure assays with
the other Hub components all the while maintaining a high degree of productivity and cost effectiveness."

Tau aggregation is a shared pathology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias known as tauopathies.
Because each disorder develops a unique combination of aggregate polymorphisms and co-morbidities that may
influence the course and severity of disease, elucidating the relationship between tau aggregate structure and
biological activity has become a high priority in the field. Advances to date have been limited, however, by the
lack of rigorously standardized aggregate preparations from each form of tauopathy and by the absence of tools
needed to selectively detect their presence in biological models and clinical specimens. The proposed
Interdisciplinary Research Network on Biologically Active Tau Aggregate Polymorphs seeks to address this need
by (1) isolating a full range of biologically active tau aggregates from authentic Alzheimer's disease, Corticobasal
Degeneration, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and Pick's disease brain tissue, (2) establishing their structures
through biophysical analysis, (3) developing probe sets for their selective detection, and (4) disseminating
reliably vetted samples and lab-ready protocols for their handling and storage to the broader research
community. In accomplishing these goals, the network will support research into the molecular basis of tauopathy
pathogenesis and catalyze efforts toward creating novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies specifically tailored
against toxic tau aggregate polymorphs."

frequent cause of SCN. CLPB is a nuclear-encoded protein that resides within the inner mitochondrial
membrane space where it functions as a molecular chaperone to disaggregate and facilitate re-folding of
misfolded proteins. However, the mechanisms linking impaired CLPB function to a defect in granulocyte
formation are unclear. In this proposal, the principle investigator will test the hypothesis that mutant CLPB acts
in a dominant fashion to disrupt the chaperone function of CLPB, resulting in impaired mitochondrial stress
responses and induction of apoptosis in promyelocytes. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are
proposed: Aim 1) to determine whether CLPB mutations impair the mitochondrial response to endoplasmic
reticulum stress in granulocytic precursors; Aim 2) to examine the impact of CLPB mutations on the switch
from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in early granulocytic precursors.
 The proposed studies should provide an understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of CLPB-
mutant SCN. Ultimately, a better understanding of normal and SCN-related granulopoiesis may suggest new
therapeutic approaches to treat or prevent neutropenia in patients with SCN, and in patients receiving
myeloablative chemotherapy.
 The long-term goal of this physician-scientist candidate is to establish a productive and independent
laboratory at a major academic institution studying normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The primary mentor
is Dr. Daniel Link, a distinguished scientist who is also an experienced and committed mentor. A panel of
senior investigators with complementary scientific and translational expertise will serve on a formal K99
mentorship committee to provide both scientific and career guidance. Washington University is an exceptional
environment to train junior investigators, especially those interested in hematopoiesis. There is ready access
to numerous core facilities and a strong intellectual environment with experts in stem cell biology, neutrophil
biology, mitochondrial biology, and cellular models of hematopoiesis. In addition to taking courses in
biostatistics and bioinformatics, the candidate will take advantage of the broad portfolio of workshops offered at
Washington University to help junior investigators establish and run an independent laboratory. Washington
University has committed to providing laboratory space and resources to facilitate the candidate’s transition to
independence."
10866516,"Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) has revolutionized the treatment of certain malignancies and responses
in refractory B cell tumors treated with chimeric antibody receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells have
been remarkable. However, ACT is not consistently curative even in these particularly responsive cancers,
highlighting the critical need for innovative approaches to improve this powerful therapeutic approach. Type I
interferon (IFN) signaling through the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) plays a key role in the activation,
differentiation and function of T cells. Importantly, degradation of the type I interferon receptor chain subunit
1 (IFNAR1) in anti-tumor T cells favors tumor progression whereas its genetic or pharmacologic (by p38
inhibition) stabilization improves anti-tumor T cell activity in mouse models. While rodent studies have yielded
much preclinical insight into CAR T cells, they fail to accurately predict clinical safety and efficacy. However,
genetically outbred and immunologically intact canine cancer patients that develop tumors spontaneously are
rapidly gaining traction as an invaluable preclinical model. In exciting new preliminary data, we infused CAR T
cells treated with the IFNAR1 stabilizing p38 inhibitor ralimetinib into a canine B cell lymphoma patient.
Following treatment, we observed signs associated with CAR T cell mediated anti-tumor activity that have not
been previously observed in canine patients treated with CAR T cells. Furthermore, in human chronic
lymphocytic leukemia patients, an active type I IFN gene signature was associated with improved outcomes
following CAR T cell therapy. Together, these data support the hypothesis that stabilization of IFNAR1 on the
surface of CAR T cells will improve their therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of B cell malignancies. We will
perform the following studies to test this:
1. Canine cancer patients with spontaneous diffuse large B cell lymphoma currently being enrolled in a pilot
trial will be used to determine the safety and efficacy of IFNAR1-stabilized CART cells.
2. CART cells derived from multiple species will be evaluated in vitro and in vivo to ascertain the mechanism
by which genetic and pharmacologic IFNAR1 stabilization enhances the anti-tumor activity of CART cells.
3. The prognostic significance of IFNAR1 and downstream signaling in T cell apheresis products used to
manufacture CAR T cells and CAR T cells themselves will be evaluated in patients with B cell malignancies.
We anticipate that IFNAR1 stabilization will safely enhance the activity of CAR T cells. As a veterinary
oncologist with doctoral training in immunology I have a solid foundation of the knowledge and skillsets required
to undertake these studies. The proposed research on the application of CART cell therapy for the treatment of
B cell neoplasia will be performed under the expert guidance of Ors. Fuchs and Mason and represents a field for
which the University of Pennsylvania is globally renowned."
10825613,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Incarcerated individuals have higher rates of chronic disease than the general population, and disease
burden will likely increase as the prison population continues to age. Despite this, health care services in prison
primarily focus on infectious diseases, mental illness, and substance abuse, largely neglecting chronic physical
health conditions. The Chronic Disease Self-Management Program (CDSMP) is an evidence-based program
developed to support self-management for people with chronic illnesses. At least 10 randomized trials conducted
in non-correctional settings have linked CDSMP to disease-related improvements and reduced healthcare
expenditures. CDSMP has been used in state corrections systems via 3 approaches: 1) bringing community
agency CDSMP leaders into the correctional setting to lead the program, 2) training correctional staff as program
leaders, and 3) training incarcerated individuals to serve as peer leaders. To date, however, there has been little
research into efficient and effective strategies for scaling up the intervention within state corrections systems
using any of these approaches. Scale-up (i.e. deliberate efforts to increase the impact of successfully tested
health innovations to benefit more people and promote sustainability) is an understudied concept in
implementation science, with few existing empirical studies that explicitly focus on the process of scale-up.
Assessing scalability, however, is crucial for ensuring sustainability of complex interventions within resource-
poor settings. The research objective of this K01 is to evaluate and maximize the scalability of CDSMP among
older adults in state correctional systems. Guided by the Scaling up Management Framework, we will use a
mixed methods research approach to query community agency leaders, staff, and incarcerated individuals about
ways to maximize the scalability of CDSMP within state correctional settings and develop and refine CDSMP
scale-up strategies for these settings. Our goal is to develop scale-up strategies to be evaluated in a subsequent
randomized implementation trial. The training objectives of this K01 will add expertise in implementation science
and justice-involved research to my existing knowledge base in biopsychosocial models of disease, social
gerontology, health disparities, quantitative analysis, and chronic disease management, to reach my goal of
becoming an independent researcher who uses implementation science approaches to improve health outcomes
among justice-involved populations. As the prison population continues to age, the burden of chronic disease
within correctional systems will continue to increase, which contributes to skyrocketing correctional costs.
Understanding how to expand evidence-based chronic disease programs within correctional systems is crucial
for reducing disease-related morbidity and mortality among incarcerated individuals and for reducing costs. This
line of research will identify and test scale-up strategies for chronic disease management in prisons."
10834751,"Project Summary
Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) remains a major and growing medical burden with unsatisfactory therapeutic options
that fail to reverse established disease. Our prior work has identified that YAP/TAZ activation in fibroblasts is a
central feature of the pathological feedback loop that propagates progression of PF. In the prior funding cycle,
we identified Dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) agonism as a strategy to inactivate YAP/TAZ selectively in lung
fibroblasts, leading to accelerated resolution of experimental pulmonary fibrosis in mice in part by switching
lung fibroblasts from matrix depositing to matrix degrading state. Moreover, we demonstrated that the lungs of
individuals with PF exhibit a deficit in expression of DOPA decarboxylase (DDC), the enzyme that catalyzes
conversion of L-DOPA into bioactive dopamine. These studies lead us to propose that restoration of
endogenous local dopamine levels in the lung is an essential trigger for the matrix degradation and fibrosis
clearance that is essential to successful repair of the lung, but is impaired in PF. Our preliminary data show
that Ddc transcripts are transiently depressed in lung tissue of young mice following bleomycin injury and rise
during fibrosis resolution, whereas aged mice exhibited sustained reductions in Ddc that parallel persistent
fibrosis. Moreover, small molecule inhibition of Ddc enzymatic activity or the D1R from day 21 to 42 post-
bleomycin in young mice ablates the spontaneous resolution of lung fibrosis, demonstrating the essential role
for dopamine signaling in fibrosis resolution. In addition, we find that dopamine is detectable in supernatants of
precision cut lung slices and is diminished in slices cultured from fibrotic lungs, confirming the local synthesis
of dopamine within the lung. Based on these findings, we propose to test the central hypothesis that epithelial
dopamine synthesis is essential to fibrosis resolution and that restoration of normal dopamine levels in PF lung
tissue can promote collagen resorption and repair of the lung. We will test this hypothesis in three aims
spanning non-resolving mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis as well as ex vivo models of mouse and human
lung tissues. To define the functional roles of dopamine signaling we will leverage both cell-specific conditional
genetic models as well as well-characterized small molecule inhibitors and dopamine agonists in these
systems. Together our studies will define the cellular sources and regulatory systems that control dopamine
bioavailability during normal lung repair, and will delineate how this repair system fails in human PF. These
studies may reveal new therapeutic approaches to promote fibrosis resolution and lung repair."
10883572,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cellular metabolism is highly dynamic and strongly influenced by its local vascular microenvironment, gaining a
systems-level view of tumor metabolism and vasculature in vivo is essential in understanding many critical
cancer biology questions. However, there are surprisingly few techniques available that can quantify the key
metabolic and vascular endpoints together in vivo with easy access. The goal here is to fill this gap by
developing a point-of-care optical spectroscopy platform with a tumor-sensitive fiber probe and novel ratio-
metric data processing techniques to quantify the major axes of tumor metabolism (glucose uptake,
mitochondrial membrane potential, Bodipy) and the associated vasculature (oxygenation, hemoglobin) on
biological models in vivo. For scientific validation and translational purposes, we will compare our techniques
with existing metabolic tools, we will also integrate our optical strategies with the state-of-art metabolomics
technique, i.e. Stable Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics (SIRM), to provide a rapid and comprehensive
understanding in tumor metabolism. We will then demonstrate our synergistic approach through addressing a
contemporary problem in cancer therapy for head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Specifically, we
will address the critical challenge of radio-resistance (RR) in HNSCC and test the hypothesis that radiotherapy
(RT) induced HIF-1α and HIF-2α activation and the following metabolic changes are responsible for HNSCC
RR and recurrence, the tumor-specific in vivo genetic editing platform targeting on HIF-1α and HIF-2α can
improve RT efficacy. Our point-of-care optical spectroscopy along with novel ratio-metric algorithms make our
technologies easy to access, easy to use, and systematic, which are all critical to maximizing its accessibility
for cancer research. Our spectroscopy techniques and their integration with the SIRM will provide new ways of
studying cancer biology and diseases, and they will also impact the study of a wide array of other biomedical
problems through the lens of tumor bioenergetics and vasculature. Our study on HNSCC RR mechanisms and
the demonstration of tumor-specific genetic editing platform in orthotropic HNSCC models will offer new ways
for targeted RT to improve HNSCC patient survival rates. The platforms and methodologies developed in this
project will be applicable to the study of RR and recurrence in other types of human cancers."
10836539,"Our objective is to develop better assays for measuring antibodies produced in people after influenza infection
or vaccination. We’ll develop assays that measure total antibody responses, and assays that specifically
measure the antibodies responsible for protection from infection. By using high-throughput multiplexed formats
employing reagents that can be prepared and stored in large lots, the assays will address many of the practical
limitations of current gold standard methods like the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) and the viral micro-
neutralization (MN) assay. The assays will use the Meso Scale Diagnostics® (MSD) electrochemiluminescence
(ECL) assay platform, which has been widely adopted for qualification of COVID-19, pneumococcal and other
vaccines. The assays will use multi-well plates with arrays of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in each well to
support the simultaneous measurement of antibodies against the strains represented in a vaccine, and to
analyze cross-protection against other strains of interest. A set of detection reagents and assay formats will be
developed that, when used with the antigen array component, will support a range of measurement modalities.
These include the measurement of (i) antibodies that block the ability of each antigen to recognize sialic acid
(SA) modified host proteins; (ii) total IgG and/or IgA against each antigen (in blood or respiratory samples); and
(iii) antibodies recognizing pre-selected universal epitopes. Through this work, we will provide important tools for
accelerating the development of new influenza vaccines.
The phased UH2/UH3 program will include the following main components. In the UH2 feasibility/early
development phase we will develop and optimize the required assay reagents needed to measure antibody
responses to 10 recent vaccine strains, as well as several historical human strains and potentially pandemic
avian strains. In this phase, we will also optimize the assay formats and assemble sample sets for later validation
work. In the UH3 validation phase, we will establish manufacturing procedures for producing assay kits to
conduct the proposed assay methods, and validate performance by testing well-characterized sample sets and
comparing our results to established gold standard methods.

10899653,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Rationale: The spread of artemisinin (ART)-resistant Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf) strains across Asia and their recent emergence in Africa and South America imperils efforts to
treat and control malaria. ART resistance is mediated primarily by mutations in Pf K13, which reduce drug
activation by decreasing hemoglobin endocytosis and which initiate quiescence during peak drug levels. Our
preliminary data have uncovered a role for tRNA modification reprogramming and proteomic changes in mutant
K13 parasites exposed to ART pressure. In this mentored career project, we hypothesize that quiescence is
epigenetically regulated by reprogramming tRNA modifications, which leverage codon-biased translation to alter
the parasite proteome and enable the survival of ART-treated mutant K13 parasites. Candidate: As an Infectious
Diseases physician with a PhD in Microbiology and Immunology, I am uniquely positioned to bridge biomedical
research and patient care to understand the molecular mechanisms that Pf employs to survive ART treatment.
Further training in molecular parasitology, mass spectrometry, proteomics, RNA biology, and epigenetics will be
crucial for my development into an independent academic physician-scientist specializing in Pf stress responses
and drug resistance. I have a renowned mentor in Dr. David Fidock and benefit from an outstanding multi-
disciplinary team of experts to guide my training and research progress. Environment: The Fidock laboratory at
the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) has been a pioneer in applying genetic and multi-omic
tools to explore Pf resistance to ART and other drugs. This enriching environment also provides access to
multiple isogenic k13-edited Pf lines and a large network of collaborators including experts in mass spectrometry-
based tRNA modifications, proteomics, and codon-biased translation. CUIMC also has a long track record of
enabling young physician-scientists to develop independent and successful careers in academic medicine.
Approach: Our central hypothesis is that tRNA modification reprogramming, specifically the s2U modification, is
central to how parasites achieve ART resistance by altering their proteome and regulating entry into and exit
from drug-induced quiescence. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the kinetics of tRNA modification reprogramming in
isogenic ART-resistant and ART-sensitive parasites across a panel of K13 variants and genetic backgrounds. In
Aim 2, we will apply conditional knockdown approaches to explore the role of the s2U pathway in ART resistance
and parasite survival. In Aim 3, we will test the complementary hypothesis that modifications on the amino-acyl
tRNA regulate ART-mediated quiescence. This proposal provides an innovative approach to examining how K13
mutations achieve ART resistance via epigenetic changes that reprogram tRNA modifications to alter
translational and proteomic responses to ART pressure. If confirmed experimentally, these hypotheses will set
a new paradigm for how Pf can modulate its biology to survive drug-mediated cellular stress. Our results should
also identify parasite vulnerabilities that can be leveraged into new strategies to treat ART-resistant malaria."
10873304,"Project Summary/Abstract
Two cortical pathways originate from early core and belt areas of auditory cortex: a ventral pathway subserving
identification of sounds, and a dorsal pathway that was originally defined – similar to the visual system – as a
processing stream for space and motion. It has been proposed that the auditory dorsal pathway should be
reframed in a wider sense as a processing stream for sensorimotor integration and control (Rauschecker,
2011). This broader function explicitly includes spatial processing but also extends to the processing of
auditory-motor sequences, including spoken speech and musical melodies in humans. In this long-term
project, we will test the expanded model of the auditory dorsal stream by training rhesus monkeys to produce
sound sequences on a new behavioral apparatus (“monkey piano”) developed in our laboratory (Archakov et
al., 2020). By pressing a lever, the monkey produces a tone of a specific pitch; by pressing several levers in
succession, the monkey produces a melody. After an animal has learned to reliably play the same sequence,
auditory-responsive brain regions are identified through whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) while the animal is alert and listens to the learned self-produced sequence. Control stimuli include
melodies the monkey has been passively exposed to, and novel melodies that the monkey has never heard
before. Results from the previous funding cycle show that listening to the self-produced melody activates not
only auditory areas but also motor regions of the brain, thus demonstrating the existence of internal models
linking perception and action. The locations of activated regions will now guide electrophysiological recording
with linear microelectrode arrays (LMAs). We will record neuronal responses in auditory and motor regions of
cortex to passive listening of the sound sequences and compare them to neuronal activity obtained when the
monkey actively produces the sequence with and without sound. Finally, we will add video of a monkey playing
the sound sequence on the monkey piano and study multisensory interactions along the dorsal stream using
fMRI and LMAs. In particular, responses in caudal auditory belt and parabelt will be compared with those in
premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex in simultaneous recordings. Our studies, using alert monkeys
trained in a behavioral task, will contribute to the understanding of unified principles of perception and cognition
across sensory systems and their interactions with the motor system in the form of internal models.
Investigating the auditory dorsal stream in a nonhuman primate will provide essential information on the origin
of human communication, including speech and music. Our studies are relevant for higher–level processing
disorders of speech and its production, such as apraxia of speech, non-fluent aphasia, and specific language
disorders that involve inadequate coordination between sensory and motor systems. The results will also
improve our understanding of sensorimotor disorders, such as ataxia, which may be caused by stroke or
neurodegenerative disease, thus leading to better therapies and rehabilitation strategies."

 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed
world, affecting 11% of adults over the age of 85. In the United States alone, the disease currently afflicts
10 million individuals, with health care costs in the billions of dollars. The 2005 discovery of a Y402H
variant in complement factor H (CFH) as a risk factor was a major advance in AMD genetics, however
the functional significance of CFH and Y402H and the pathogenic mechanisms that initiate and promote
the disease remain poorly understood. The canonical model of CFH function is that it binds to heparan
sulfate (HS) on cell surfaces where it inhibits alternative complement pathway activity by two distinct
mechanisms. Thus, the prevailing hypothesis for AMD pathogenesis is that missense mutations in HS
binding sites in CFH, that include Y402H, result in defective binding to cell surfaces and ectopic
activation of the alternate complement pathway in the retina. As a consequence of this activation,
increased inflammation, cytolytic activity, and the accumulation of lipid-rich deposits (i.e. drusen)
promote AMD pathogenesis.
 In stark contrast to this canonical model, preliminary studies by the PI and co-workers indicate
that CFH-1, a CFH homolog in C. elegans, localizes on the ciliary membrane of C. elegans
mechanosensory neurons in a heparan sulfate dependent manner where it maintains inversin/NPHP-2
within its eponymous cilia compartment. Additional data indicate that the inversin/NPHP-2 compartment
is compromised in human Y402H photoreceptors, suggesting that this novel function for CFH-1 is
conserved in human CFH. On the basis of this data, the PI proposes the radical hypothesis that CFH is
an essential structural component of sensory neuron cilia in the human retina and that structural defects
in photoreceptor cilia promote AMD pathogenesis in patients with CFH loss-of-function mutations. The
aims of this proposal will extend these preliminary studies and use classic molecular and genetic
techniques to dissect the mechanism of CFH-1 localization and function in restricting inversin/NPHP-2
distribution in C. elegans mechansensory neuron cilia. This novel model of CFH-1 function in C. elegans
will be tested in human photoreceptors using a retina organoid model derived from induced pluripotent
stem cells and genotyped post-mortem retina. Together, the proposed work will provide substantial
insight into previously unappreciated CFH functions that are likely to contribute to a unique new model
of AMD pathogenesis."

Despite advances in treatment, such as targeted and immune therapies, lung cancer remains a deadly
malignancy with five-year survival below 25%. About two-thirds of NSCLC diagnoses are made in former
tobacco smokers, who are at 6-fold higher risk for the disease compared to non-smokers. Unfortunately,
attempts to identify chemopreventive agents that reduce the risk of cancer in ex-smokers have been
unsuccessful. Currently in the US, about 60% of ex-smokers are either overweight or obese. We have
observed that for lung cancer, the well-known anti-cancer effect of the common diabetes drug metformin is
restricted to patients who are overweight or obese. In investigations that followed this novel finding, we have
found that in both humans and mice, obesity is associated with changes in the lung tumor immune
microenvironment that promote disease progression, and that these changes are susceptible to reversal by
metformin. Prominent among these changes is the impact of metformin on activation of immunosuppressive
regulatory T cells (Tregs), which is known to be an important immunological event in carcinogenesis. We
hypothesize that the obesity-specific immunomodulatory action of metformin also occurs in obese/overweight
ex-smokers at high risk of lung cancer. If true, this concept will establish a basis for metformin's
chemopreventive potential to abate lung cancer development in a major fraction of the population at high risk
for the cancer. To examine this preventive potential of metformin, we will conduct a small phase II trial with at-
high-risk obese/overweight subjects to establish that months-long oral metformin treatment diminishes markers
of immunosuppressive Tregs in lungs and enhances markers local pulmonary and systemic
immunosurveillance activity (Specific Aim 1). To identify mechanisms that underlie the obesity-specific
immunomodulatory effects of metformin, we will study the impact of this drug in obese and non-obese mice of
two distinct but complementary mouse lung cancer models (Specific Aim 2)."

Systemic sclerosis (SSc; Scleroderma) is a connective tissue disease of unknown etiology that is associated
with significant morbidity and mortality. It has long been presumed that SSc likely results from environmental
triggers, although these environmental insults have not been identified. The gold standard for assessing the role
of environmental and inherited genetic effects on the development of a disease is the study of twins. A cross
sectional study of twins with SSc we conducted several years ago showed a comparable concordance for
disease of approximately 5% in monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. We propose to conduct a follow-up
study of the twin cohort to determine longitudinal concordance for disease, ANA status, and autoantibody
presence. Since epigenetic regulation has emerged as an important mechanism mediating gene expression
and the manifestation of a disease phenotype, we will also compare the DNA methylation profile of twins
longitudinally. One of the factors we recently implicated in dermal fibrosis in SSc is estrogen. Our findings show
that estrogen levels are elevated in Caucasian patients with diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc and identified clinical
features of disease associated with elevated estrogen levels. Since dcSSc is more severe in African Americans
(AA), we now propose to measure estrogen levels in post-menopausal AA women and men of similar age with
dcSSc and identify correlates with clinical features of the disease. Our findings will significantly advance our
understanding of disease pathogenesis in SSc, propel progress in the field, and importantly provide new avenues
for research for mentees to facilitate their research and allow them to establish their own independent research
programs. These mentees will be integral participants in my program throughout the award period. I will mentor
junior physician investigators in the assessment of SSc in patients and the absence of disease in healthy twins,
evaluation of Raynaud phenomenon, detection of autoantibodies, obtaining informed consent, banking and use
of clinical samples, examination of DNA methylation profiles, measurement of estrogen, and identification of
associations with clinical variables. The mentoring goals of this application also include mentoring junior clinician
investigators in patient-oriented research, grantsmanship, manuscript writing, responsible conduct of research,
entrepreneurship and innovation, and career development. My reputation as an excellent mentor coupled with
the collaborative and supportive environment at the Medical University of South Carolina, the resources available
at the institution and via the CTSA, and the resources of the Division of Rheumatology P30 CCCR, provide the
perfect environment for attracting and training successful clinician investigators. My ultimate goal is to ensure a
pipeline of well-trained clinical investigators who will continue the mission of treating patients and identifying the
cause and cure for Scleroderma and related diseases."
10923828,"Hearing loss disrupts communication, which in turn jeopardizes effective medical care. Hearing loss is
associated with poor mental and physical health, and is remarkably prevalent among older Veterans (close to
80% with bilateral >40 decibel hearing loss, among those 80 and older). Every year, several hundred thousand
hearing loss-impacted older persons visit VA Emergency Departments (EDs) – noisy settings that are among
the most “difficult listening situations” in clinical medicine. Many older adults will arrive without a hearing
assistance device, given the low rate of hearing aid use in the elderly population.
 Extensive research underscores the importance of good communication during “care transitions” –
points in time when patients leave one care setting for another. In the case of the ED, discharge to home may
be a risky transition for patients who do not understand discharge instructions, such as which medications to
take, or how to recognize “red flag” symptoms that indicate the urgent need for further medical attention.
Patients who lack understanding of discharge instructions are at risk for repeat ED visits and/or
hospitalizations.
 The goal of this study is to test whether providing hearing assistance devices to older age hearing
impaired patients in the ED setting will improve in-ED understanding and preparation for discharge. The
proposed intervention, the Hearing Impairment, Strategies and Outcomes in VA Emergency Departments
(HearVA-ED) will be conducted in the Emergency Departments of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VAs of the New
York Harbor Healthcare System and will recruit hearing impaired ED patients who are 60 years and older and
have been admitted to the ED with a low acuity triage score indicating a high likelihood of discharge home. We
will identify hearing impairment by using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly survey (HHIE-S). We
will randomize consenting patients who fail the screening to either receipt of a simple hearing assistance
device (a “PockeTalkerTM”) during their ED stay or usual care. We will test whether the provision of a
PockeTalkerTM is feasible in this environment (by measuring the amount of device use), whether providing the
device improves self-reported quality of hearing and understanding during the ED stay, and whether use of the
device improves the quality of preparation for post-discharge care.
 If this randomized controlled trial demonstrates beneficial effects for in-ED use of a simple hearing
assistance device for hearing impaired patients, this strategy can be disseminated throughout the VA
healthcare system."
10792919,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this grant is to understand how bystander infections with intestinal parasites alter chronic
infection with γ-herpesviruses. This is important because herpesviruses infect virtually all people and
approximately a quarter of the world’s population is simultaneously infected with a parasite. Herpesvirus
infections are chronic, but these viruses do not persistently replicate in a healthy host. Instead, they
establish a quiescent infection, termed latency. We discovered previously that co-infection with an
intestinal helminth parasite after infection with γ-herpesvirus led to increased virus reactivation from
latency. We detailed a mechanism whereby reactivation of the virus depended on sensing host cytokines
produced in response to the parasite. A remaining question is whether the timing of the dual infections is
important. In this grant we propose to address this question by changing the order of virus-parasite co-
infection to determine whether reactivation of the virus is increased by parasite infection when the
parasite infection occurs before the γ-herpesvirus infection. We have data to indicate that prior infection
with an intestinal parasite increases γ-herpesvirus reactivation, but that the mechanism is different than
what we discovered previously when parasite infection occurs after the herpesvirus infection. We find
that parasite infected animals have increased resident peritoneal macrophages. We also find that when
retinoic acid, which is required for maintenance of resident peritoneal macrophages, is depleted in mice,
parasite infection no longer increases virus reactivation. Our hypothesis is that parasite infection, in a
retinoic acid dependent manner, alters the tissue composition of resident macrophages. This promotes
retention of a population of infected macrophages with enhanced γ-herpesvirus reactivation. In this
proposal, we aim to examine the role of resident macrophages and retinoic acid in parasite-induced
herpesvirus reactivation. These studies will deliver insight into the mechanisms that drive herpesvirus
reactivation during co-infection and will increase our understanding of parasite modulation of tissue
resident macrophages. Harnessing the power of mouse model pathogens, these studies will advance our
understanding of pathogen co-infection."

For patients with cirrhosis, liver transplantation is a well-established therapy, restoring liver function and
reversing portal hypertension within days to weeks of the surgery itself. But cirrhosis also leads to insidious
extra-hepatic effects such as muscle wasting, malnutrition, and functional impairment that may take months to
reverse, if at all, which can compromise health and wellbeing (“global functional health”) after transplantation.
In the ambulatory setting, these chronic cirrhosis manifestations can be captured by measures of “frailty”, the
chronic biological state of decreased physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to health stressors, and
operationalized using the Liver Frailty Index (LFI)—which our team developed from grip strength, chair stands,
and balance. When assessed in the ambulatory setting, LFI predicts adverse health outcomes including
hospitalizations and mortality. Frailty is now a well-accepted construct in hepatology/transplantation: in 2019,
the American Society of Transplantation (AST) endorsed the use of standardized frailty metrics, including the
LFI, for ambulatory liver transplant evaluation. However, approximately 1/3 of cirrhosis patients are
hospitalized with acute illness immediately prior to transplant, in whom pre-morbid, ambulatory, frailty metrics
may not be available. In this setting, transplant clinicians have, in many instances, been applying this construct
in the acute care setting to inform transplant decisions—often informally through an “eyeball test”—despite a
lack of studies evaluating the construct of frailty or tools to measure frailty in acutely ill patients. Unlike in the
ambulatory setting where frailty represents factors that would not reverse with liver transplantation, a single
frailty assessment in the acute setting may simply reflect the severity of acute liver-related decompensation,
which, in theory, could reverse with a new liver. On the other hand, frailty trajectories may be informative of a
patient’s ability to recovery a major stressor such as transplant surgery, so application of frailty as a trajectory
may be more clinically appropriate. But testing of these hypotheses has not yet been done. In this proposal, we
will leverage our 9-center research network to develop and validate a novel inpatient frailty index optimized for
this acutely ill population, investigate models incorporating single and longitudinal assessments of frailty for the
prediction of 1-year post-transplant global functional health, and associate inpatient frailty assessments with 1-
year post-transplant healthcare utilization. Impact: Our proposal will result in a pragmatic, objective tool to
standardize assessment of frailty in acutely ill patients with cirrhosis undergoing liver transplantation and
clinical prediction models to guide use of single and longitudinal assessments of frailty for transplant decision-
making in this clinically dynamic population. Understanding the precise relationship between acute care frailty
and outcomes is essential to facilitate appropriate and systematic implementation of frailty in transplantation."

There are two observed phenomena that defy the traditional Alzheimer’s disease (AD) trajectory; those who
resist the accumulation of AD pathology (amyloid and/or tau) despite evidence of risk factors, and those who
present with AD pathology but remain resilient to cognitive decline. Classifying these individuals who will likely
manifest resistance or resilience to AD over their lifetime is critical for informing clinical practice and transforming
clinical trial recruitment. It remains unclear how combinations of risk factors, whether demographic, vascular or
neuroimaging, may help to increase accuracy for predicting an individuals’ likelihood of manifesting resistance
or resilience to AD. Further, very little is understood about how sex, race and their interaction influence these
phenomena. Relatively limited sample sizes and low racial diversity have so far hampered studies. The overall
goal of this proposal is to develop and validate robust predictive algorithms of resistance and resilience to AD by
harmonizing data from 13 well characterized and racially diverse cohorts of clinically normal older adults
(n=~15,000). This innovative proposal could transform approaches for both clinical decision making and clinical
trials. Based on a simple set of easily accessible medical information, such as demographics, vascular risk,
APOEe4 status, and brain volumetric data when available, our validated models will provide interpretable patient-
level predictions of resistance and resilience with 10-year risk estimates of AD pathological burden and cognitive
decline given a patient’s profile. Similarly, our predictive algorithms will provide a predictive framework of who
should be invited for initial screening and serve to predict those most likely to accumulate Ab/tau or exhibit short
term decline within the course of a clinical trial. We propose to harmonize data from 13 cohorts of ~15,000
clinically normal individuals, to accomplish the following aims: (1) build predictive algorithms to classify those
who are resistant to either amyloid or tau and validate these models to demonstrate their utility in clinical practice
and AD prevention trials, (2) build and validate predictive algorithms to classify those who are cognitively resilient
in the face of abnormal levels of amyloid or tau, and (3) examine how intersections between sex and race can
produce more refined individualized risk profiles that are reflective of these two critical population strata that are
known risk factors for AD. Our strong interdisciplinary team spans the breadth of cognitive neuroscience, PET
and MR neuroimaging, biostatistics, behavioral neurology, and epidemiology. Our multi-PI team reflect four
critical areas of expertise that are essential to this proposal: (1) data harmonization, (2) neuroimaging, (3)
machine learning, and (4) cognitive resilience. We have published a range of data harmonization approaches
for both cognitive and PET neuroimaging data, which can be flexibly applied to different data types. Using these
approaches, we will identify higher-order interactions between multiple risk factors (demographics, vascular risk,
neuroimaging) to build individualized risk profiles of both resistance and resilience to AD. This innovative
proposal has the potential to transform the way we approach clinical practice and clinical trial design."
10817205,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Perseverative behaviors are prominent, disabling, and often treatment-
resistant symptoms of several neuropsychiatric disorders including Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
Perseverative behavior refers to the repetition or continuation of a response that no longer results in a reward or
expected outcome. Human neuroimaging data has associated abnormal activity within orbitofronto-striatal
circuits with perseverative behavior in OCD patients. While early human neuroimaging studies identified
overactivation of the entire orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), more recent studies have linked overactivation of the
lateral OFC (lOFC) and hypoactivity of the medial OFC (mOFC) with OCD symptoms. Furthermore, preclinical
work in rodents suggests that activating mOFC-striatal projection neurons drives perseverative behavior, while
activating lOFC-striatal projection neurons suppresses perseverative behavior. Yet, a substantial gap in
knowledge remains regarding the mechanisms underlying the differential regulation of perseverative behavior
by the mOFC versus lOFC. This project will use chemogenetic and fiber photometry technologies in freely moving
mice to determine how neuronal activity within the mOFC versus lOFC regulate perseverative behaviors. We will
induce perseverative behavior in mice using acute challenge with a serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) agonist.
Pharmacological challenge with agonists for the 5-HT1BR, previously termed 5-HT1Dβ in humans, exacerbates
symptoms in OCD patients. Similarly, we found that treating mice acutely with a 5-HT1BR agonist induces
perseverative behaviors including a highly repetitive form of hyperlocomotion termed “route stereotypy”, and
perseverative responding in a delayed alternation task. These 5-HT1BR agonist-mediated effects can be
prevented by the only effective monotherapy for OCD, 4 weeks of chronic treatment with SRIs. Thus, acute 5-
HT1BR agonist treatment induces perseverative behaviors in mice with relevance to OCD. We will combine fiber
photometry and chemogenetics with our well-validated behavioral methods to identify the mechanisms
underlying the differential control over perseverative behavior by the mOFC versus lOFC. Previous work reported
that optogenetic stimulation of mOFC-ventromedial striatal projections induces perseverative grooming in mice,
while other work showed that optogenetic stimulation of lOFC-centromedial striatal projections suppresses
perseverative grooming. Here, we will assess the effects of chemogenetic inhibition of neuronal projections from
the mOFC versus lOFC to a large centromedial striatal region on 5-HT1BR agonist-induced perseverative
behavior. We will also determine whether perseverative behavior is associated with differential changes in
serotonin release into the mOFC versus lOFC using GRAB5-HT, and/or differential changes in the activity of
GABAergic interneurons or orbitostriatal projection neurons within the mOFC versus lOFC. Since dysfunction
within orbitofrontal-striatal circuits and the serotonergic system is also implicated in anorexia nervosa, addictive
disorders, and autism spectrum disorders, our findings will be broadly applicable to a number of conditions."
10806221,"ABSTRACT
 Vertebrae originate from somites during embryonic development. Somites are segmented from the
presomitic mesoderm (PSM) and the process is known as somitogenesis. Somitogenesis is controlled by key
Notch signals in the PSM that oscillate with a periodicity matching that of somite formation. Hypoxia occurs
naturally in developing embryos before the circulatory system is established. However, exacerbation of hypoxia
as it may take place during gestation disrupts the oscillatory Notch signals in the PSM and leads to abnormal
somitogenesis and altered spine development. Spondylocostal Dysostosis (SCDO) is characterized by severe
vertebral malformations and is caused by homozygous loss-of-function mutations of components of the Notch
signaling pathway. Mice carrying similar homozygous mutations phenocopy the human disease. Heterozygous
Notch LOF mutations cause the more modest, although more frequent, human defect of congenital scoliosis
(CS), which is also phenocopied in heterozygous mouse mutants. These mice phenotypes are worsened by
gestational hypoxia. The mediators of the hypoxic response are the transcription factors Hypoxia-Inducible
Factor-1alpha (HIF1) and HIF2. The role of HIF1 and HIF2 in somitogenesis has not been addressed. To fill
this gap of knowledge, we conditionally inactivated HIF1 in the PSM using TCre transgenic mice (HIF1
mutants). Loss of HIF1 in the PSM causes abnormal somitogenesis and spine malformations reminiscent of
SCDO/CS and gestational hypoxia. Conversely, preliminary data showed that HIF2 is not necessary for spine
development, but the concomitant loss of HIF1 and HIF2 ameliorates the spine abnormalities observed in HIF1
mutants. Hypoxia increases stability and transcriptional activity of the HIFs; therefore, we were intrigued by the
observation that gestational hypoxia and loss of HIF1 in the PSM alter somitogenesis in a similar manner.
Notably, both loss of HIF1 and gestational hypoxia led to an increase in intracellular hypoxia in the PSM.
Furthermore, preliminary findings revealed that the impairing of mitochondrial respiration, which was used as a
tool to reduce intracellular hypoxia, partially corrected the spine defects observed in HIF1 mutants. Considering
our preliminary data, ourworking hypothesis is thatboth loss of HIF1 in the PSM and gestational hypoxia
increase intracellular hypoxia, which in turn dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway and alters
somitogenesis. We also hypothesize that loss of HIF1 in the PSM stabilizes HIF2 by increasing intracellular
hypoxia, and the augmented HIF2 transcriptional activity mediates some of the effects due to loss of HIF1. Our
hypotheses will be tested in two Aims. Accomplishment of the proposed experiments will establish, for the first
time to our knowledge, the role of HIFs and mitochondria respiration in somitogenesis. It will position HIF1
upstream of the Notch signaling pathway in PSM. It will shed new light into our current understanding of the in
vivo cross-talks between HIF1 and HIF2. Lastly, it will provide novel insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms
leading to congenital scoliosis because of gestational hypoxia."

The cardiac fibroblast and its ability to convert into a myofibroblast for extracellular matrix (ECM) production,
ventricular remodeling and the fibrotic response has been an area of recent investigation with important medical
relevance. Here, a dual-PI renewal resubmission application is proposed by a developmental cardiac biologist
and adult disease-based cardiac biologist to address how the postnatal heart matures in adulthood and then
transitions back to a fetal-like program with disease stimulation through direct paracrine crosstalk and ECM
feedback. During the past funding cycle of this award, we identified key regulatory relationships that exist
between myocytes and fibroblasts in both the developing and diseased adult heart, whereby the ECM and
transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) served as an integrating platform between these 2 cell-types. We have
also observed that fibroblast-expressed GDF10 and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family member
pleiotrophin (Ptn) mediate critical crosstalk between fibroblasts and myocytes. Here, we will investigate the
hypothesis that TGFβ is a myocyte selective maturation factor that controls fibroblast activity in generating an
effective ECM within the postnatal heart that also underlies adult disease, and that parallel Ptn and GDF10
signaling crosstalk further regulates fibroblast proliferation and promotes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in
development and disease. The dual-PI renewal application has 3 specific aims: 1) To examine how
cardiomyocyte generated TGFβ1/2/3 and its subsequent signaling to cardiac fibroblasts underlie ECM neonatal
maturation and adult ventricular remodeling, 2) To examine how cardiac fibroblast generated ECM regulates
developmental cardiomyocyte maturation and adult heart remodeling, in part through TGFβ1/2/3
sequestration/release, and 3) To examine the function of the cardiac fibroblast-secreted growth factors Ptn and
GDF10 in postnatal heart development and adult injury. Collectively, these specific aims will uncover novel
signaling mechanisms that underlie heart maturation just after birth and determine how these mechanisms are
redeployed in disease. Thus, the impact of this program will be the identification of novel signaling mechanisms
and effectors that can be therapeutically targeted in human heart disease to positively effect cardiac remodeling
and longstanding fibrosis, with added implications for treating congenital malformations and developmental
growth abnormalities."

Despite modern treatment advances over the last several decades, most youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) fail
to meet recommended targets for glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c. As glycemic control
remains the single most important predictor for long term outcomes, adjunctive interventions are needed. One
approach is to bolster multidisciplinary care delivery, the traditionally hospital-based management approach for
T1D, through partnering with community organizations that support youth and families where they live. The
school setting provides such an opportunity, as children spend nearly half their weekday waking hours there
under the care of school nurses, providing a consistent and supervised environment. Though limited in their
design, prior studies of T1D school-centered interventions have suggested a benefit to enhancing school-
provider collaboration for management. Yet, this relationship remains sub-optimal. Our prior work has identified
that school nurses feel they make valuable contributions for T1D which are often unrecognized, and providers
desire more feedback from school health staff. Enhancing this partnership may be accomplished through a
Collaborative Care Model, previously studied for mental health conditions in primary care and school. Adapting
this model for T1D may offer a systems-based approach to support school nurses, youth with T1D, and their
families. The overall objective of this mentored K23 award is to develop and pilot test a School-PArtnered
Collaborative carE (SPACE) intervention for T1D. Dr. March will discover the contextual factors affecting
implementation of school-based collaborative care using mixed methods (Aim 1), design the SPACE for T1D
intervention through an iterative, community-partnered process (sub-Aim 2A), select valid measures to
evaluate SPACE with parents of children with T1D (sub-Aim 2B), and test the SPACE for T1D intervention in a
pilot cluster-randomized controlled trial with the primary outcome of feasibility (Aim 3). Secondary outcomes
will address other implementation-focused measures (e.g., acceptability, usability, etc.), and an exploratory
goal will be to descriptively assess candidate outcomes for a future fully powered trial. Paired training activities
are cohesive with each research Aim and include to advance understanding in applied implementation science
principles, develop skills in user-centered design, and cultivate competences in clinical trials. These studies will
provide preliminary data to support future R-level studies examining factors affecting implementation of T1D
interventions in schools nationally and testing the SPACE intervention in a fully powered, cluster-randomized,
hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. In addition, cross-disciplinary mentorship and career development
activities will foster Dr. March’s transition to independent funding mechanisms. By completing this K23, Dr.
March will have the training, experience, and preliminary data needed to become an independent physician-
scientist leading studies aligned with NIDDK’s strategic mission to advance stakeholder-engaged research
which disseminates and implements evidence-based treatments in community settings."
10849744,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the cardinal motor
symptoms of resting tremor, hypokinesia, muscle rigidity and bradykinesia. To date, dopamine replacement therapy using
the dopamine precursor levodopa, or L-DOPA, remains the gold standard treatment for the motor symptoms in PD.
However, development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) represents a major dose-limiting adverse effect associated
with the long-term treatment of PD using L-DOPA. For example, approximately 10% of PD patients per year develop
LIDs within the first 7-8 years of L-DOPA treatment. Moreover, there are no effective treatments for either preventing the
development of LIDs or reversing already established LIDs in PD patients. To date, there remains a critical unmet need
to develop novel therapeutic approaches for the complications associated with chronic L-DOPA treatment in PD. We
have recently discovered a series of dopamine 4 receptor antagonists which are potent and selective for the D4 receptor
over the other dopamine isoforms, and a wide selectivity panel. In addition, we have shown that a prototypical compound
from this scaffold was capable of producing antidyskinetic action in a mouse model. Subsequently, we have discovered
two additional novel scaffolds that show excellent potency and selectivity as D4 antagonists. In this proposal, we will
improve and optimize our lead scaffolds in order to improve the ADME properties (metabolic stability) while maintaining
the potency and selectivity. In order to develop these best-in-class compounds, we will utilize an iterative medicinal
chemistry approach and integrated DMPK studies which will allow us to evaluate potency and selectivity, but also the in
vitro and in vivo DMPK properties of newly made compound in a timely manner. The advanced D4 receptor antagonist
compounds will then be evaluated in an in vivo animal model of LIDs. These selective D4 receptor antagonist will offer a
unique opportunity to help advance the field toward a first-in-class therapeutic agent."
10642853,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., often driven by irreversible cardiac tissue damage
leading to heart failure. Cardiac tissue does not naturally regenerate, and thus is an important area of focus for
tissue engineering. Previous development into engineered heart tissue (EHT) ""patches"" with some functional
architecture such as pre-patterned vasculature and alignment has shown promising results when implanted
into small animal models. Moreover, injected stem cells and implanted cardiac ""sheets"" have shown some
success in restoring some cardiac function when implanted into infarcted hearts of large animals or humans.
Despite these successes, scaling EHT that incorporates important functional features such as vascularization
and alignment to a physiological thickness (cm-scale) remains a major engineering challenge.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate in vitro physiologically thick heart tissue patches that can
ultimately be implanted into patients to replace damaged tissue. Two key considerations for recapitulating
native tissue are (1) cardiac tissue is highly vascularized, and (2) alignment of cells and extracellular matrix
within each physiological layer is critical to function. We address these challenges utilizing novel open
microfluidic patterning approaches. Our open microfluidic technological advancement offers unique benefits to
EHT; for example, it is compatible with virtually any hydrogel, including standard extracellular matrix material
such as collagen and fibrin, used extensively for EHT. It is also compatible with specialized stimuli-responsive
engineered hydrogels, opening up possibilities for complex engineered tissues with spatial and temporal
control. Further, the flow of precursor fluid is driven by passive surface tension forces; thus, sensitive stem-cell-
derived cells are not exposed to shear stress from extrusion through a needle or photochemical crosslinking,
which are requirements for other tissue fabrication techniques such as 3D bioprinting. Finally, a large area (cm-
scale) can be patterned with a single pipetting step, making this fabrication approach ideal for generating large
(cm-scale) tissues. In this proposal, I apply these unique attributes of open microfluidic pattering to EHT.
Specifically, the ability to pattern enzymatically degradable gels through a background of standard cell culture
ECM materials such as collagen or fibrin enables the patterning of complex vasculature in three dimensions. I
will also take advantage of previously demonstrated modular stacking of open microfluidic devices and
suspended microfluidics to generate aligned EHT patches. In these patches, the tissue is anchored on either
end, inducing ECM remodeling and alignment. Each layer is generated and aligned independently. Then, they
are stacked together at an angle from the previous layer, creating a multilayered tissue mimicking the heart's
helical tissue fiber alignment. As such, I will address in two independent aims, vascularization and tissue
alignment of physiologically thick EHT using open microfluidics."
10851880,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Endothelial dysfunction is causally implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the main
cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The endothelium regulates arterial diameter and
vascular homeostasis via the production of a myriad of vasoactive substances including nitric oxide (NO). NO
is a powerful vasodilator produced in response to blood flow-induced shear stress, which is detected by
mechanosensitive endothelial luminal structures. The glycocalyx is such a mechanosensor. It consists of a
mesh of interwoven glycoproteins and proteoglycans that, when disturbed by shear stress, converts
mechanical forces into biochemical signals. The appropriate result of this process, known as
mechanotransduction, is endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD), which is considered the gold-
standard physiological measure of endothelial function. Notably, impaired FMD is highly prevalent in T2D and
also represents a critical component of the mechanisms that lead to CVD. However, despite the major role
that reduced FMD plays in T2D-associated CVD development, the mechanisms that lead to this abnormal
response are not completely known. In addition, there are currently no specific therapeutic means to alleviate
impaired FMD. A central goal of this proposal is to decipher the mechanisms underlying the impairment of
FMD in T2D and discover new therapeutic targets to improve it. Based on our prior work and most recent and
exciting preliminary data, we propose the novel hypothesis that increased plasma neuraminidase activity
degrades glycocalyx structures via activation of ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17) and
promotes endothelial dysfunction in T2D. We will test our innovative hypothesis with gain- and loss-of-function
pharmacological and genetic-manipulation experiments in human cultured endothelial cells and isolated
arteries, in animal models of neuraminidase ablation and T2D, and in patients with T2D. Specifically, in Aim 1,
using cultured endothelial cells and isolated arteries from humans, we will determine the mechanisms by which
neuraminidase activity increases endothelial ADAM17 activation and impairs FMD. Subsequently, in Aim 2,
we will determine the effects of neuraminidase inhibition on endothelial function in animal models and patients
with T2D. We hypothesize that neuraminidase inhibition in T2D mice or humans improves FMD and overall
vascular function. Our team is poised to move cardiovascular and diabetes research forward with a project
that will exert a sustained, powerful impact across a number of levels of inquiry that are novel conceptually,
mechanistically, methodologically, and therapeutically. Indeed, targeting neuraminidase activity holds
extraordinary promise for correcting endothelial dysfunction in T2D and ultimately preventing/treating T2D-
associated CVD."
10837788,"Project Abstract/Summary
Development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) prior to the age of 20 years has been associated with rapid disease
progression and early exogenous insulin dependence.1 Furthermore, adolescents with T2D are more likely to
develop diabetes-related comorbidities, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and kidney disease earlier
compared to adults, highlighting the need for a fundamentally different (and perhaps more aggressive) treatment
approach in adolescents.1 Obesity (body mass index [BMI] >95th percentile for age and sex) is a primary risk
factor for the development and progression of T2D.2,3 However, current treatment guidelines for T2D in
adolescents recommend lifestyle management and metformin (+ insulin) as first-line therapy, which rarely result
in BMI reduction or slowing of T2D disease progression.1,4-7 Therefore, novel treatments that meaningfully reduce
BMI, delay exogenous insulin dependence, and potentially slow the progression of T2D need to be investigated
in adolescents with T2D. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) may represent an ideal first-
line therapy for adolescent T2D. GLP-1 RAs increase postprandial insulin secretion and reduce glucagon
production, and at higher doses, can result in clinically meaningful BMI reduction by suppressing appetite and
enhancing satiety.8 Liraglutide (a daily injectable GLP-1 RA) at its 1.8 mg/day dose was approved for adolescents
with T2D in 2019, but liraglutide has not been studied with a primary focus on BMI reduction and insulin sensitivity
or ß-cell function in adolescents with T2D.9,10 Therefore, the overall objectives of this study will be to 1) evaluate
the effects of liraglutide at its obesity medicine dose (3.0 mg/day) versus standard-of-care on BMI reduction, and
2) evaluate its effect on insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in adolescents with T2D and obesity. The overall
hypothesis is that liraglutide 3.0 mg/day will result in a greater mean BMI percent change as well as
improvements in insulin sensitivity and β-cell function as compared to placebo plus standard-of-care. The focus
on using liraglutide at its obesity medicine dose in adolescents with T2D is novel and important; prior studies
evaluating liraglutide have not been generalizable to adolescents with this aggressive disease nor have prior
studies had the majority of patients on the maximum liraglutide dose, making dose-dependent weight-loss
evaluations difficult. The proposed study will generate preliminary data to inform the design of a larger and
sufficiently-powered R01 trial. Importantly, this mentored project will provide essential training in clinical trial
design and implementation in a unique and challenging patient population, as well as measures of insulin
sensitivity/β-cell function. These skills will facilitate my scholarly independence and serve as the foundation of
my future career focusing on the application of obesity medicine principles in the treatment of adolescents with
T2D."

Although there has been substantial progress in the development of medications to lower pulmonary
vascular resistance in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), there are no therapies that are known to
benefit the right heart in the absence of changes in right ventricular afterload in patients with PAH. Right
heart failure is the key driver for morbidity and mortality in patients with PAH, but also complicates a
range of other common diseases such as emphysema, interstitial lung disease, and left heart failure.
We are pursuing a novel approach that targets angiotensin receptors in patients with PAH and right
heart failure. Previous animal studies suggest angiotensin signaling may contribute to myocardial
fibrosis and could also be important in the pathogenesis of PAH and pulmonary vascular remodeling.
Angiotensin receptor blockers are well established in left heart failure where their benefit is not merely
a result of improvement in left heart afterload. Our work has shown a substantially lower all-cause
mortality in veterans with pulmonary hypertension who use angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or
angiotensin receptor blockers. These mechanistic and observational results raise the strong possibility
that angiotensin receptor blockade might be an effective treatment for right heart failure.
Angiotensin receptor blockade is an appealing therapeutic target that is well aligned with current NIH
priorities of repurposing existing, inexpensive, and well-tolerated medications for novel use in other
disease states. Medications for PAH are particularly expensive. If adjunctive therapy with an angiotensin
receptor blockers are efficacious, this would benefit PAH patients and society at-large.
We propose a Phase 2, single-center, randomized placebo-controlled trial of valsartan (an angiotensin
receptor blocker) in adults with PAH. The study will evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of a 24-
week course of valsartan. The primary endpoint is change in six-minute walk distance at 24 weeks.
Secondary endpoints include differences in right ventricular function, biochemical markers of right heart
failure (NT-proBNP), New York Heart Association Functional Class, health related quality of life (as
assessed by the disease specific emPHasis-10 instrument), and the frequency with which routine
therapies for patients with PAH are escalated during the trial."

Cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been closely correlated with tauopathy as
measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Other pathophysiological factors (e.g., amyloid-beta and
neurovascular dysfunction) associated with cognitive decline contribute to the biological and clinical
heterogeneity in preclinical AD. Identifying this heterogeneity is crucial for improving the detection of preclinical
AD in cognitively normal (CN) individuals. Capturing pathophysiological events in preclinical AD has been
challenging with traditional pencil-and-paper cognitive assessments. Features of a cognitive digital clock
drawing test (dCDT) that capture time-stamped coordinates of drawing outcomes and process have
demonstrated superior correlations with tau PET in elderly CN subjects. However, the dCDT features used in
current studies were selected based on the clinical diagnosis between AD and CN subjects.
 The overall goal of this project is to 1) identify novel dCDT features most correlated with underlying AD-
related pathophysiology measured using state-of-the-art multimodal neuroimaging techniques, accounting for
biological and clinical heterogeneity in preclinical AD, and 2) establish the longitudinal performance of dCDT in
capturing cognitive decline in preclinical AD. The identification of the novel dCDT features will provide a non-
invasive assessment of cognitive status in the context of progressive pathophysiological events in preclinical
AD. This will enable efficient and cost-effective participant screening for AD therapeutic trials, facilitate the
translation of digital testing into AD primary care settings, and in doing so, improve its access for underserved
populations. During the K99 phase, we will identify novel dCDT features most correlated with tau PET
measures using machine learning and deep learning. To accomplish these goals, the applicant will leverage
existing skills in PET imaging and machine learning and gain additional training in 1) multimodal neuroimaging,
2) deep learning, 3) pathophysiological, and 4) neuropsychological changes related to normal aging and AD.
With these training activities, the applicant will be well poised to conduct the R00 phase to evaluate the dCDT
performance in the context of clinical and biological heterogeneity in preclinical AD using multimodal
neuroimaging techniques. This award will facilitate the applicant’s transition to an independent researcher who
will utilize multimodal neuroimaging to better understand the biological mechanisms underlying brain disorders."

 ANGEL2 is an RNA-binding protein (RBP), and member of the catabolite repression 4 (CCR4) family of
proteins, which are involved in the modulation of mRNA stability and translation. With clinical significance,
decreased ANGEL2 expression across 17 different cancer types is correlated with both poor overall and
disease-free survival. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ANGEL2 modulates tumorigenesis have
yet to be determined. Gene expression correlation analysis revealed a functional relationship between
ANGEL2 and the tumor suppressor TP53. Consistently, ANGEL2 deficiency caused a substantial loss of TP53
expression and resulted in multicellular tumor spheroids adopting a stellate/invasive morphology. In addition,
an ANGEL2-derived peptide increased TP53 expression and decreased multicellular tumor spheroid growth.
TP53 is a transcription factor and stress sensor which plays an integral role in maintaining the genome.
Inactivation of TP53 occurs in more than 50% of human cancers, and is a hallmark of tumor progression and
chemoresistance. It is therefore widely recognized that loss of wild-type TP53 expression/function is a driver of
tumor progression. Consequently, determining the key modulators of TP53 is paramount for the understanding
of tumorigenesis and the development of the novel therapeutic approaches. This project aims to elucidate
the role of ANGEL2 in TP53-dependent tumor suppression, and to determine if this pathway can be
targeted to enhance wild-type TP53 expression and suppress tumor growth. Utilizing ANGEL2 knockout
cell lines, coupled with xenograft and patient-derived organoid models, the effect of ANGEL2 on TP53
expression, and TP53-dependent tumor suppression will be determined. Moreover, the use of molecular and
biophysical tools to design and modify ANGEL2-derived peptides to upregulate wild-type TP53 expression will
be explored as a therapeutic approach for malignancies which carry wild-type TP53.
 These studies will guide the career development of Dr. Christopher Lucchesi by providing relevant
knowledge and skills obtained through collaborations and courses in molecular and biophysical techniques,
3D-organoid tumor modeling, peptide drug design, translational research and leadership skills. Dr. Lucchesi
will also profit from the wealth of available resources at UC Davis to equip him with the necessary skillsets to
reach his career goals. Through training in this collaborative, ‘One Medicine’ environment, Dr. Lucchesi will be
a competitive, independent investigator and a leader of a successful and productive research team."

The diversity of the United States population is not reflected in its biomedical sciences workforce, with the
greatest disparities at the highest levels of degree attainment and in careers that require advanced degrees.
Institutions of higher education have both the capacity and the imperative to address the structural barriers that
create inequitable outcomes in degree attainment for underrepresented populations, both at the undergraduate and
graduate levels of education. The University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver) is unique and uniquely positioned
to meet this goal. CU Denver (comprised of the downtown Denver campus and the Anschutz Medical Campus) is
a “Doctoral University: Higher Research Funding” with a funding portfolio of $790 million and a combined
enrollment of 19,395 students. It is the only public urban research university in the State of Colorado and the most
diverse institution in the CU system: on the Denver campus, at least 58% of incoming first-year students identify
as students of color and 43% as underrepresented minority students. CU Denver's commitment to equity, lifelong
learning, innovation, research excellence, and community care underlie its record of investment in undergraduate
research and improving student success outcomes, including the timely graduation of undergraduate students and
their transition into doctoral programs in biomedical sciences. The purpose of the CU Denver Maximizing Access
to Research Careers program proposed here (MARC at CU Denver) is to continue this record of excellence and
further contribute to the development of a diverse and inclusive national biomedical research workforce by
providing underrepresented, honors-eligible undergraduate science majors with the courses, structured training
activities, mentoring, and authentic research experiences necessary to transition successfully into research-focused
biomedical doctoral programs. With prior funding and institutional support, CU Denver has spent nearly a decade
developing, implementing, evaluating, and refining a successful training model that builds trainees' science
knowledge and scientific thinking skills, research experience, communication and networking skills, sense of
belonging and wellness skills, and career development skills. With continued institutional support and a record of
success with a similar program, a new MARC at CU Denver program will support 30 trainees over five years
such that 90% or more will complete their baccalaureate degrees in a biomedical science related field at CU
Denver (80% or more in two years after joining the program) and 60% or more will matriculate into doctoral
programs in biomedical science within three years of graduating, with an 80% doctoral program completion rate.
The success of MARC at CU Denver is bolstered through institutional support for a base-building “pre-MARC”
program for first and second-year students, scholar wellness and resiliency training and support, and continued
external program evaluation. The scope of MARC at CU Denver is broadened through direct institutional support
for additional senior CU Denver MARC Affiliate Scholars."
10849921,"The Medical Summer Student Research Program (MSSRP) at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW)
leverages the research and training expertise of MCW’s faculty and its substantial research infrastructure to
provide robust research training opportunities for first year medical students (M1). The goal of the MSSRP
is to expose M1 medical students to research and careers in biomedical science and academic medicine in
cardiovascular, pulmonary and blood-related fields at a critical time in their career decision-making process.
The goal is accomplished by three objectives, which are (1) to provide trainees with rigorous, hands-on,
fundamental research experiences within the basic science, clinical and/or translational research
laboratories of funded MCW investigators focused on diseases of heart, lung and blood; (2) To facilitate
opportunities for trainees to observe how new discoveries translate into the development of new drugs,
devices and treatment modalities in the clinical arena; and (3) To encourage trainees to remain connected
to research and mentoring beyond the short-term through opportunities to publish, present and participate
as Honors in Research candidates or in advanced research electives and pathways throughout their
education curriculum. The MSSRP students are engaged full-time short-term training regimen of 11 weeks
in their M1 summer year in basic science, clinical or translational laboratory studies that address diseases
and conditions affecting the cardiovascular, pulmonary or hematological health of our citizens and globally.
They have an option for additional 4 weeks of training in their M2-M4 years, which could culminate in a
manuscript or thesis submission, and thus result in “Honors in Research,” designation on their diplomas.
The training is complemented by a series of didactic seminars and other activities that deepen the
integration of the trainees into the scientific community. These experiences facilitate opportunities for
trainees to observe how new discoveries translate into the development of new drug targets, devices and
treatment modalities in the clinical arena, while also encouraging them and providing them with outlets to
remain connected to research throughout their medical education program. There is a high demand for
training and a qualified applicant pool, with good outcomes evident over the 6-10 years time span that
separates the summer training period from the beginning of an independent career. We request

HIV-1 infection results in destruction of T helper cells, leading to immunodeficiency and the
disease known as AIDS. Most currently available antiretroviral drugs target the viral reverse
transcriptase, integrase, and protease enzymes. These medicines are effective but not curative,
and therapy must be adhered to rigorously and permanently. Moreover, HIV-1 constantly evolves
and acquires mutations rendering it resistant to therapies. Therefore, ongoing research is needed
to develop drugs against new viral and cellular targets. Owing to its multiple functions in infection,
the HIV-1 capsid represents an attractive therapeutic target, and potent inhibitors targeting this
structure have shown promising results in clinical trials. The capsid, which is an assembled lattice
composed of a single viral protein, forms a shell around the viral genome and associated proteins
and is essential for efficient reverse transcription, a key early step in HIV-1 infection.
Perturbations to the stability of the capsid result in abortive infection, yet the mechanism by which
the capsid ensures efficient reverse transcription is unknown. This project will fill this gap by
defining the effects of capsid perturbations on HIV-1 reverse transcription in vitro, and vice-versa.
Using native viral cores purified from infectious HIV-1 particles, we will employ cutting-edge
biophysical techniques together with computational and molecular virology approaches to
precisely define the role of the viral capsid in HIV-1 reverse transcription. The project will
accomplish the following goals: (1) define the biochemical requirements for reverse transcription
in HIV-1 cores; (2) define the structural transitions in the core during reverse transcription; (3)
determine the role of capsid pores in nucleotide uptake during reverse transcription; and (4)
precisely define the protein-nucleic acid interactions within the core during specific stages of
reverse transcription. Collectively, this project will yield a greater understanding of capsid function
in HIV-1 infection, thereby informing the mechanism of action of an emerging class of antiviral
drugs.
Relevance
The results of this project will be a greater understanding of the functions of the viral capsid that
are critical for HIV-1 infection. This information will inform the development of capsid-targeting
antiviral drugs and improve the treatment of HIV-infected persons, thereby improving public health
and reducing the spread of HIV-1."

Developing three-dimensional antisense oligonucleotide drugs against COVID-19
The culprit of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has a very large RNA genome that encodes the proteins and RNA elements
required for all aspects of viral infection and replication. This property makes the virus vulnerable to a new class
of drugs called antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). ASOs are single-stranded synthetic nucleic acids that achieve
therapeutic effects by binding to viral or other target RNAs via Watson-Crick base pairing, the very interaction
that defines molecular biology and the foundation of life. The first ASO drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is an antiviral against cytomegalovirus. A major challenge of developing ASO antiviral drugs is
the strong tendency of RNA to fold into structures that interfere with ASO hybridization. Current ASO design
methods do not adequately address this problem.
We have developed a structure-based ASO design technology platform that takes advantage of three-
dimensional structures of target RNAs. Our “3D-ASOs” recognize not only the sequences but also the shapes of
SARS-CoV-2 RNAs. Compared to conventional designs, 3D-ASOs contact viral RNAs more extensively and
therefore can achieve greater affinity and specificity. Our technology platform includes four design templates and
a 3D-ASO drug development workflow that employs an innovative RNA structure determination method. In a
preliminary study, we designed and tested several 3D-ASOs against SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and identified two
lead sequences that strongly inhibit viral replication in cultured human cells to a much greater extent than
previously reported sequences. In the proposed research, we will optimize the lead 3D-ASOs by altering their
backbone modifications and bases for tighter binding and better fit to the viral RNAs and for stronger inhibition
to their functions. We will also cast our net wide by designing and testing additional anti-SARS-CoV-2 3D-ASOs.
Finally, the most potent 3D-ASOs will be tested in an animal model. If successful, the project will provide ASO
drug candidates for clinical trials. These drugs may be given as nasal sprays or via intravenous injection, as
treatments or for prevention. The structure-based design technology we will refine is generally applicable to ASO
drug development. Therefore, this research has the potential to turn tide on the battlefield against COVID-19 and
in our fight with many other diseases."

The most potent risk factor for the development of bipolar disorder (BP) is a first-degree family member with
the illness; individuals with family history typically experience early BP onset and severe course. Up to 25%
of offspring of parents with BP (OBP) develop BP by young adulthood. Using longitudinal data from the
Pittsburgh Bipolar Offspring Study (BIOS MH60952), we developed a clinical tool (“risk calculator”) that
reliably predicts an individual OBP’s 5-year risk for BP using a subset of demographic and clinical variables.
This innovation offers the ideal opportunity to identify OBP at greatest risk and deliver indicated preventive
interventions. Yet, to date, there is no evidence-based intervention for OBP who have not already developed
mood disorder. Per the experimental therapeutics framework, promising approaches should be informed by,
and target, factors that cause and sustain illness. Evidence suggests the pathway to develop BP among
biologically vulnerable youth involves sleep and circadian disturbances. We adapted Interpersonal and
Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT), an evidence-based treatment for BP adults that helps stabilize sleep/
circadian patterns, for adolescent OBP. In an open pilot and subsequent R34 randomized trial (MH091177),
we established a preliminary efficacy signal for IPSRT with OBP. Our data further indicate IPSRT, but not
Community Treatment Referral (CTR), engages and alters the hypothesized mechanism of action--sleep/
circadian disturbance, although practical barriers impacted treatment attendance. This proposal represents
a vital next step in this program of research: a confirmatory efficacy trial of IPSRT delivered via telehealth for
OBP (age 12-18, n=120) at elevated risk for BP onset via risk calculator score. All participants receive a
baseline clinical assessment of psychiatric symptoms and sleep disturbance (via objective and subjective
methods), followed by a feedback session. Youth are then randomized to receive 8 sessions of IPSRT or a
manualized Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Program (HL) delivered via secure videoconference to enhance
attendance and reach. As clinically indicated, youth are offered CTR for any psychiatric symptoms/disorders
identified at intake. Primary outcome domains over 18 months include subthreshold mania and affective
lability--2 potent near-term predictors of BP in OBP that are themselves associated with morbidity and
impairment. We will also further investigate the hypothesized mechanism underlying IPSRT-sleep/circadian
disruption--across levels of analysis using reliable, cost-effective methods (actigraphy and daily diary
ratings), and the contribution of interpersonal stress to sleep/circadian disruptions. Application of
Implementation Science methods throughout maximizes ultimate scalability and feasibility if efficacious. We
will also examine whether passive cellphone sensing may serve as a portable, cost-effective measure of
mechanisms and outcomes to enhance ultimate dissemination. Research in this area has the potential to
prevent, delay, or ameliorate the progression of this chronic and devastating illness in those at highest risk."

Mononuclear phagocytes (MP; monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells. and microglia) serve as human
immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) reservoirs, sites of viral persistence and latency, and inducers of end-
organ disease. All are commonly linked to HIV-1 pathobiology. However, the key relevance of the MP viral
reservoir rests in the central nervous system (CNS) of those people living with HIV (PLWH). In those PLWH and
receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), the evidence for the size, scope, and disease relevance of the CNS viral
reservoir remains under appreciated. The discordance between laboratory MP infection and tissue persistence
in an infected human host is also not yet known. MP can have an extended life span and possess self-renewing
potential, and as such, are likely more relevant in disease than currently appreciated. Evaluation of the
significance of MPs, in general, and the microglia specifically will help define the importance of MPs during
natural infection. For the CNS specifically, HIV-1 enters the brain soon after infection and replicates in
perivascular macrophages and MGL along with limited numbers of astrocytes. Viral set point and timing of ART
initiation determines the latent reservoir size; each affects the efficiency of any eradication strategy. Knowledge
of the viral dynamics, CNS viral invasion, susceptibility to MP infection, and composition of CNS HIV reservoir
will facilitate effective therapeutic interventions. To each of these ends, we will employ novel techniques to study
the MP HIV-1 reservoir in laboratory systems and in a newly developed human microglial mouse model of human
disease. We will use basic and applied MP biology, theranostics, novel ART nanoformulations, molecular and
cellular biology, and our unique animal model to study the means to eliminate viral infection at the subcellular,
cellular, and tissue level with newly designed and novel therapeutic methods that include gene therapy
strategies. Our aims are to determine the efficiency of viral suppression by native and nanoformulated ART (at
subcellular level), assess the breadth of the CNS viral reservoirs against viral set points (defined by the initiation
of ART), and to explore combination strategies for HIV-1 elimination in a new developed humanized microglial
mouse."

The purpose of the Duke Environmental Analysis Laboratory (DEAL) Hub is to offer a comprehensive suite of
analytical services to support epidemiologists and health researchers conducting studies focusing on the
impact of environmental exposures on human health. This Hub will require a well-organized and efficient
administrative structure. Thus, the overall purpose of the DEAL Administrative Core is to manage, coordinate,
and supervise DEAL activities in a manner which is responsive to the HHEAR Network’s vision. The
Administrative Core consists of four specific aims: 1) provide administrative support and facilitate day-to-day
operations for DEAL’s Environmental Sample Analysis Resource (ESAR) and Developmental Cores; 2)
establish and maintain a close communication between DEAL and the broader HHEAR Network, including the
HHEAR Coordination Center, Data Center, and other HHEAR laboratory hubs; 3) provide client services and
consultation on client requests for analyses and services for proposed projects and to help with the oversight of
sample tracking and progress on projects; and 4) organize and facilitate internal evaluation and self-
assessment with the support of both the internal and external steering committees. These aims will be
achieved through the development and implementation of an internal and external communication and
coordination plan—the former will coordinate activities between the three DEAL Cores, while the latter will
involve communication and coordination with the broader HHEAR Network. The Administrative Core team will
also develop an evaluation and monitoring plan that will collect and evaluate data for each of the DEAL Core’s
specific aims and ensure that goals are being met. The Administrative Core will be led by Dr. Heather
Stapleton, and administrative functions will be handled by a well-organized management team, including Dr.
Ellen Cooper (Program Manager) and Ms. Sharon Zhang (Administrative Manager). Dedicated oversight from
the Administrative Core will ensure an integrated, highly collaborative relationship among the DEAL Cores and
with the broader HHEAR Network, with the intended results being more streamlined workflows and
communication to maximize quality and support for clients’ analytical service needs."

Abstract
The Clinical Core serves an important function as the central resource for the diverse CTNA projects and
pilots. The opportunity to fund a central core with a distinguished leader provides a programmatic method to
define needs and assign resources to address central issues. The central components of the Clinical Core
are oversight of subject recruitment, participant safety and clinical assessments in human studies, and data
management and biostatistical support for all Center projects. The Core also oversees the creation of a cross-
project “Core Database” for investigating phenotypes relevant to the CTNA and its mission. The specific aims
for this core are:
A. Centralized monitoring and recruitment of subjects to: 1) Enhance the efficiency of enrollment into each
 project, including pilots; 2) Ensure the safety of participants and 3) Update the Principal Investigators (PIs),
 the Steering Committee, the Program Advisory Committee, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board of
 progress on the protocols.
B. Central oversight of assessments to: 1) Provide efficiency in training and assessment; 2) Maintain
 consistency in the administration of assessments; 3) Enhance the ability of investigators to pool data
 across studies; 4) Ensure that validated and current assessment tools are used; and 5) Support secondary
 analyses utilizing core assessments from the Core database.
C. Central provision of data management and biostatistics support to: 1) Provide design and analytical
expertise to meet the goals of the CTNA scientific agenda; 2) Provide state-of-the-science methods for
data management; 3) Generate randomization lists and assess randomization implementation; 4) Interface
with specialized data analysis expertise related to particular technologies associated with the CTNA,
including genetics and imaging; 5) Prepare reports related to the progress of clinical studies for the Data
Safety Monitoring Board, FDA and NIH; 6) Provide statistical support for all investigators; and 7) Create

10861887,"Prenatal substance exposure is a significant public health problem affecting 10% of infants (over 360,000 in
2020). Criminal justice-oriented policies enacted to protect these newborns are associated with negative
consequences for both the mother and infant, suchas lower rates of maternal substanceuse treatment utilization
in pregnancy, higher rates of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) diagnoses at birth, and
disproportionately higher child protective services (CPS) referral rates for Black and Indigenous infants. On the
other hand, states without substance-exposed infant policy lack infrastructure for systematic responses to
support these families. In 2016, the primary U.S. child welfare policy—the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment
Act (CAPTA)—was amended to increase mother-infant health and substance use treatment utilization while
ensuring infant safety by mandating that all dyads receive a plan of safe care. Seeking to protect dyads from
intensive surveillance and threat of foster care placement, in 2019 Connecticut became the only state to use a
“masked” approach that requires plans be developed by community providers with perinatal mothers without
disclosing their identifiable information to CPS.
 Dr. Margaret Lloyd Sieger is one of a small handful of researchers in the U.S. working to identify how public
health policy can increase health and safety for substance exposed infant-mother dyads. Her preliminary
research in Connecticut indicates that providers are developing plans with mothers. With this K01 award and
support from three state agencies, two large birthing hospitals, and a multidisciplinary mentorship team of
national experts, Dr. Lloyd Sieger will apply a theory of health services utilization to examine the effect of plans
of safe care on: (1) substance use treatment utilization, (2) child safety, and (3) racial disparities in CPS
involvement. The proposed project will achieve its aims using innovative, scientifically rigorous approaches to
linking three state administrative databases and recruiting mothers at the time they develop a plan of safe care
for a longitudinal survey. This K01 award will provide Dr. Lloyd Sieger with training and experience in: (1)
pertinent, multisystem clinical issues, (2) longitudinal survey research with perinatal mothers, (3) statistical
methods for multi-system data linkage and multilevel analysis, and (4) collaborations for multi-site, multi-state
research. This award will also lead to an R01 proposal to conduct a multi-site, multi-state study on plans of safe
care, thereby addressing NIDA’s priorities to understand effective policies that prevent child welfare system
involvement for mothers with substance use disorders and infants with prenatal substance exposure. Finally,
this award will set the foundation for Dr. Lloyd Sieger’s productive, independent program of research that
integrates substance use epidemiology, policy, and clinical interventions to improve outcomes for pregnant and
parenting mothers with substance use disorder and their infants."

Asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) can progress to rupture with an out-of-hospital
mortality of 90%. Accelerated AAA growth is associated with platelet activation and platelet
aggregates (thrombi) in aneurysmal segments. Antiplatelet drugs may limit AAA growth and rupture
risk. A mechanistic explanation for these observations has never been elucidated. This project builds
upon our discovery that platelets from patients with AAA are hyperactivated through selective surface
receptors and that the antiplatelet drug aspirin partially inhibits AAA growth and rupture. This
suggests a new link between platelet activation and aneurysm development, and implies aspirin may
not be the best antiplatelet drug to suppress. aneurysm growth. Using an ex vivo system to
recapitulate disturbed (turbulent) blood flow in aneurysmal arteries, localization of an olfactory
receptor on the surface of the platelet membrane is a new and promising target to suppresses AAA
growth. Discovering this pathway in platelets from patients with AAA exposed to turbulent blood flow
is a conceptual advancement in our understanding of how platelets mechanically sense and respond
to their external environment. Platelets therefore emerge as circulating biosensors, releasing proteins
that are useful biomarkers for distinguishing fast from slow-growing aneurysms. This project offers
the promise of the first medical therapy to treat AAA."

Liquid biopsy applications are rapidly emerging as a minimally invasive approach to collect system-wide
representative analytes for genomic monitoring of physiologic and disease-related changes. Dying cells release
fragmented DNA into the circulation, referred to as cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Decoding the cellular origins of cfDNA
over time can reveal altered cellular contributions reflective of dynamic changes to tissue damages in longitudinal
studies. Here, I will focus on the changes in cellular and tissue homeostasis post liver transplant using molecular
analyses of cfDNA. Cell-type specific methylation patterns will be used to trace the cellular origins of cfDNA
molecules. In addition, solid organ transplant place a separate DNA set with the donor organ into the body
of the host, allowing cfDNA molecules from the allograft to be identified and validated through genotyping
using donor-derived SNPs. In this proposal, I aim to track the changing composition of cellular damage post-
liver transplant and use this information to improve diagnosis and management of graft dysfunction (Aim 1).
During transplant there is simultaneous transfer of tissue-resident immune cells along with the donor organ
tissue. I will use immune cell-specific DNA methylation patterns together with the donor SNP analysis to
distinguish the host and donor tissue-resident immune cell changes after transplant and during
immunosuppressive treatment (Aim 2).
The proposed research will evaluate an innovative approach to gain insights into the reaction of host cells,
donor organ cells, plus host and donor-immune cells relative to different transplant outcomes. A series of proof-
of-principle studies are outlined using liver transplantation as an ideal setup that introduces an organ with a
distinct genome at a specific timepoint where there will be induced changes in cell homeostasis to a range of
cells in the allografts as well as the host. Beyond the transplant outcome analysis, the cfDNA approach
established under this proposal can be expanded to determine the cellular contributions to tissue damages in
any setting. Cell type-specific methylation patterns are universal markers that can be used to trace the damaged
cell origin of cfDNA irrespective of the cause of damage. Cellular damage in the liver can be due to targeted
therapy, chemotherapy, immunosuppression or other interventions, initiation or recurrence of primary liver
malignancy, cancer metastatic seeding or organ damage observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose
that distinct cellular cfDNA signatures will be observed from different types of injury. Also, there is an unmet
need to gain insights into tissue damage during the development of new treatments and understand the
cellular basis of adverse events relative to therapeutic efficacy. The global impact of this proposal will be to
link cfDNAs in the circulation to their cellular origins and thus reveal drivers of pathophysiology."

Iraq with more than 470,000 confirmed cases of TBI from 2010- 2020. In addition, more than
82,468 Veterans who use VA for their health care have been diagnosed with at least one TBI. Chronic synapse
alternations represent an underappreciated area of interest in TBI pathobiology, with only a few published studies
in the literature (1),(2),(3),(4) and even less examined in in the subacute/chronic phase of TBI. Our preliminary
data show that there are in face persistent pre-synaptic and post-synaptic zone structural and functional
vulnerability following moderate TBI in mice. These long-term changes could hinder synaptic adaptive
mechanisms of the brain (synaptoplasticity) and therefore negatively affect brain recovery following TBI. We
have evidence that presynaptic and post-synaptic protein and lipid components are especially vulnerable
oxidative modifications and proteolysis, then leading to their down regulation. These synaptic changes, if
persisted, could hinder synaptic adaptive mechanisms of the brain (synaptoplasticity) and therefore negatively
affect brain recovery following TBI. Hypothesis: (i) TBI can cause sustained down-regulation of protein
complexes at the pre-synaptic terminal active zone, which are associated with diminished vesicular
neurotransmitter release function. (ii) In parallel, TBI also can cause oxidative and proteolytic damage of key
protein components of the post-synaptic density (PSD) - PDZ-domain scaffold proteins (PSD93, PSD95,
gephyrin) and associated calmodulin-regulator neurogranin, which can lead to instability & reduction of
postsynaptic membrane-bound ionotropic glutamate receptor (NR2A, NR2B GluR1, GluR2), GABA receptor-A
/B and dopamine receptors (D1, D2) and thus compromising the post-synaptic neurotransmission capacity. (iii)
Studying TBI–induced pre- and post-synaptic protein alternations and dysfunctions can be facilitated by the use
of synaptosome preparations isolated from injured mouse brain regions following moderate controlled cortical
impact (CCI) and repeated close head injury (rCHI) are ideally suited to examine pre- and postsynaptic protein
complex as well as in vesicular neurotransmitter release function and post-synaptic glutamate and dopamine
receptor capacity. (iv) novel therapy with an oral mitochondria-targeting BBB-crossing antioxidant Mitoquinone
(MitoQ) can help reduce post-TBI presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations and improve chronic neurobehavioral
functions as supported by our pilot studies.
In this proposal, we first aim to (1) study chronic post- CCI and post-rCHI alterations of key pre-synaptic and
post-synaptic modulatory proteins in synaptosome/synaptoneurosome preparations and by
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining and Immuno-electron microscopy. We then (2) examine chronic pre-
synaptic vesicular neurotransmitter release capacity and post-synaptic glutamate receptors functional integrity
and capacity in synaptosome preparations. We will (3) correlate changes of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic
structures and functions in hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex and amygdala with corresponding
changes in neurobehavioral endpoints involving these brain regions at 3 and 12 mo. post- TBI. (4) Examine the
effects of post-TBI (CCI or rCHI) oral daily MitoQ treatment for 3 and 12 mo. on reducing oxidative stress induced
damage to pre-synaptic and post-synaptic structures /functions, and improved synaptic mitochondrial function in
hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex and amygdala with corresponding improvement in
neurobehavioral endpoints involving these brain regions. In terms of matching US VA research and Veteran
care missions, this proposal is directly relevant to US Veterans with chronic TBI who might have persistent pre-
and post-synaptic changes that negatively affect their recovery and neurorehabilitation process."
10848346,"Kidney stone disease (KSD) results in billions of dollars in healthcare costs per year, creates large economic losses due to decreased work productivity, and negatively impacts quality of life. Black and Hispanic individuals historically have a lower prevalence of KSD compared to White individuals; however, the rate of increase in the prevalence of KSD among Black and Hispanic individuals is greater than that among White individuals. There is evidence that KSD risk is influenced by social determinants of health (SDOH), potentially contributing to the disproportionate rise in KSD risk in racial and ethnic minority populations who bear the greatest burden of adverse SDOH; however, the extent to which SDOH associate with kidney stone risk in diverse populations has been understudied. Diet and lifestyle clearly influence KSD risk. It is important to describe how all of these factors, as well as their temporal changes, contribute to KSD risk in racial and ethnic minority groups. The overall objective of this project is to assess associations of SDOH with KSD risk in racially and ethnically diverse populations, the contribution of dietary quality to these associations, and the effect of adopting a healthy dietary pattern on KSD risk. To achieve this objective, we aim to: 1) Identify risk factors for KSD prevalence in a racially and ethnically diverse pooled cohort from five observational studies; 2) Measure the associations of temporal changes in risk factors (e.g., dietary pattern, anthropometrics, SDOH, and associated chronic medical conditions) with KSD incidence among participants of Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA; a cohort of Black and White adults with over 30 years of follow-up); and 3) Determine the extent to which adopting a healthy dietary pattern, namely a Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet, improves 24-hour urinary stone risk parameters among individuals with KSD through a controlled diet study enrolling CARDIA participants. The proposed research leverages key resources at our institution, including the Birmingham Field Center for CARDIA and the Bionutrition Unit of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). We expect to elucidate the magnitude of the social and dietary determinants of KSD risk in racially and ethnically diverse cohorts, and determine the effect of a DASH-style diet on urinary stone risk factors. We also expect that this will provide the foundation for future independent grant efforts to develop more effective preventive care strategies for disadvantaged patients with KSD. This K23 award will provide the PI with training in biostatistics/epidemiology, SDOH, nutrition/dietetics, and patient-oriented kidney stone research, which will be critical for his career development and long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator. Career development activities will include a Masters of Science in Public Health in Applied Epidemiology, which will incorporate coursework in health inequities and nutrition research; the Clinical Investigator Training Program which offers training on clinical trial oversight; and regular interactions with a team of mentors and collaborators with complementary expertise in SDOH, nutrition, analysis of cohort studies and clinical trials, and KSD epidemiology/prevention."

Chronic epithelial or vascular injuries followed by dysregulated repair are the trigger mechanisms in
pathogenesis of interstitial lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Multiple cell types are
involved in lung fibrogenesis, with fibroblasts and epithelial cells given the most attention. Role of endothelial
cells and microvasculature remain unclear. Dysregulated repair causes vascular remodeling, associated with
increased vessel permeability, partial loss of capillaries, focal increase in pathological angiogenesis and
endothelial dysfunction. Normal endothelial cells (EC) are transcriptionally re-programmed into fibrosis-
associated endothelial cells (FEC), that support activated fibroblasts and promote lung inflammation. Our long-
term goal is to identify key regulators of EC-to-FEC re-programming and clarify molecular mechanisms of the
crosstalk between endothelial cells and other cell types during pulmonary fibrogenesis. In our preliminary data,
we used endothelial cells from lungs of patients with IPF and mouse lung fibrosis models to identify FOXF1 as
a key transcriptional regulator of EC-to-FEC re-programming during lung fibrogenesis. Using transgenic mouse
models with endothelial-specific deletion or over-expression of Foxf1 gene, we propose to test the hypothesis
that endothelial FOXF1 decreases activation of fibroblasts and prevents macrophage accumulation in fibrotic
foci. We propose two specific aims: (1) identify molecular mechanisms whereby endothelial FOXF1 inhibits
lung fibrogenesis, (2) establish whether restoring FOXF1 in FECs will prevent or reduce fibrotic lung
remodeling after chronic lung injury. Understanding the regulation of EC-to-TEC re-programming, and the
molecular mechanisms utilized by pulmonary endothelial cells to control pulmonary fibrosis, will provide new
approaches for treatment of interstitial lung diseases."

Pre-employment transition services is federally-mandated by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act
(2014) to help prepare autistic transition-age youth for the workforce prior to existing high school. However,
there are few evidence-based practices implemented within pre-employment transition services, which
contribute to low employment rates among autistic transition-age youth. A limitation of pre-employment
transition services is the job interview component, which utilizes teacher-led role-play training that lacks
empirical validation, is resource-intensive, and does not adhere to best practices to train sustainable changes
in behavior (e.g., repeated practice, scaffolding, token economy). Moreover, the autism community as voice
the need for better job interview preparation. To fill this training need, our team (via R34 MH111531) partnered
with the autism community to adapt Virtual Reality Job interview Training (VR-JIT, an internet-delivered job
interview simulator with four levels of automated feedback with elearning job interview content) to meet the
needs of autistic transition-age youth (now called Virtual Interview Training for Transition Age Youth (VIT)). Our
subsequent randomized controlled trial demonstrated several aspects of VIT feasibility, including delivery by
local teachers at five schools, training teachers as VIT implementers, and completing the pilot RCT (i.e.,
recruitment, enrollment, study completers). The results of this pilot study demonstrated that VIT was initially
effective at improving job interview skills, job interview anxiety, and competitive employment within 6 months of
completing VIT. Thus, the overarching goal of this study is to conduct a fully-powered trial to evaluate the
impact of VIT across approximately 16 schools via a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation RCT. Our
specific aims are to 1) Evaluate whether pre-employment transition services (ETS) with VIT, as compared to
ETS with an active control intervention (i.e., job interview didactics/elearning with a series of 3-5 minutes
videos of employed autistic adults talking about their career pathways), enhances employment outcomes; 2)
Evaluate mechanisms of employment outcomes and psychological distress by nine months post-
randomization; and 3) Conduct a multilevel, mixed-method process evaluation to assess initial implementation
outcomes (i.e., facilitators, barriers, scalability, and affordability of VIT implementation)."
10851997,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As individuals age, their health may decline, in some cases leading to the loss of key functional abilities
that enable them to work. These functional losses jeopardize prospects for healthy aging, which calls
for ongoing engagement in socially productive activities of one’s choosing. Despite the importance of
maintaining functional abilities with age, we do not yet understand how losses in particular cognitive,
physical or psychosocial abilities interact with job requirements to impede work activity. In addition, it is
unknown whether public health interventions could restore losses in critical abilities once they occur, or
even prevent such losses in the first place. Understanding which ability losses cause the most loss in
work capacity in the population is a prerequisite to identifying targets for interventions to improve
functional work capacity. Once these ability losses and their impacts are understood, potential work-
capacity interventions can be identified and evaluated. The ideal targets of work-capacity interventions
are ability losses that lead to large productivity losses in the population, but for which relatively low-
cost, effective interventions could be developed or, if interventions currently exist, could be made widely
accessible. The goal of this project is to build the research base upon which work-capacity interventions
may be developed. To do so, we will draw upon methods used for disability determination in the
Netherlands, which measures work capacity by mapping standardized measures of functional abilities
to standardized requirements of jobs across the national economy. This comprehensive mapping
between abilities and jobs allows for direct computation of the set of feasible jobs and potential
earnings for an individual, conditional on their education. The Netherlands is unique among countries in
this approach to disability determination. First, we will adapt and harmonize the Dutch functional
assessment instrument to the U.S. context and then field the assessment to a representative sample of
Americans ages 25-75 at two points in time. After mapping respondents’ functional abilities to
occupational requirements in the U.S., we will estimate cross-sectional levels of functional work
capacity as well as longitudinal ability loss/recovery rates, overall and for different age groups. Next, we
will conduct counterfactual simulations to determine the critical functional abilities that, if their loss could
be reversed through future intervention, would have the greatest impact on work capacity in the U.S.
population. Since prevention targets may differ from rehabilitation targets, we will also conduct the
reverse exercise: we will use counterfactual simulations to determine the critical functional abilities that,
if deterioration could be prevented through future intervention, would have the greatest impact on work
capacity in the U.S. population. Lastly, we will simulate the effects of changes in occupational
requirements arising from factors like technological change, pandemic risk, and climate change."
10927440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Messenger RNA, or mRNA, and its translation into protein lies at the heart of the central dogma of
molecular biology. Converting this basic cellular mechanism into a therapeutic opportunity was the basis
of the first two successful COVID-19 vaccines. This technology has the potential to be further advanced
into much broader therapeutic modalities, such as a gene replacement medicine for genetic diseases.
Currently, mRNA molecules for human therapeutics are generated from biological enzymatic reactions.
While this process can create large amounts of material, it suffers from several drawbacks. These include
multiple steps in manufacturing, purity, and patient safety. However, the greatest shortcoming is the rapid
turnover of mRNA in the body, which severely limits its duration of effect and tunability for a genetic
medicine. Unless addressed, this shortcoming will handicap mRNA therapeutics from ever becoming
more than a vaccine technology.
 Chemical modification was the missing ingredient and final piece necessary for the realization of other
recently FDA-approved nucleic acid drugs, including antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering
RNAs. Chemical modifications enabled nuclease protection, significantly extended drug half-lives, and
predictable pharmacological tuning. Likewise, realizing the full potential of mRNA as a human therapeutic
will ultimately come down to chemistry.
 RNA can be chemically synthesized in small fragments. However, no technology exists to easily
create long chemically defined translation-competent mRNA molecules. In addition, most of the chemical
modifications extensively characterized for their beneficial properties for other nucleic acid therapeutics
have not been explored in mRNA research, and certainly not in a therapeutic context. This project
proposes to tackle these challenges by generating full-length mRNAs from chemically synthesized
fragments, investigating the impact of diverse chemical modifications on mRNA translation, and applying
new synthetic chemical methods to make longer mRNAs suitable for human therapeutics.
 The aims of this proposal are to 1) evaluate the impact of specific nucleotide modifications on model
mRNA translation in cells and in vitro, 2) assess the compatibility of triazole linkages with mRNA
translation and on-resin “click” chemistry for solid-phase chemical synthesis of longer mRNA, and 3)
demonstrate long mRNA chemical synthesis and its potential for therapeutic development in cells and in
vivo. The results of this focused project should pioneer a paradigm-shifting approach to mRNA therapeutic
development and open new possibilities for conferring better control over the drug properties of mRNA."

Out of all daily experiences, salient ones are likeliest to leave long-lasting memories. A central neuronal
population encoding different aspects of salient experiences, including rewarding and aversive stimuli, reward-
predictive cues and behavioral choices, is the ventral tegmental area dopamine (VTA-DA) neurons. While the
role of VTA-DA neurons in online coding of salience is well-established, whether and how VTA-DA neurons are
involved in offline consolidation of these experiences into long-term memory is considerably less understood.
In particular, despite pharmacological evidence that dopaminergic activity during sleep is required for memory
formation, and physiological evidence that VTA representations of food stimuli can show a form of reactivation,
there are still large knowledge gaps regarding the experience dependence of VTA-DA neuronal activity during
sleep, the integration of VTA-DA activity with hippocampal (HC)-dependent memory consolidation processes,
the causal role of VTA-DA neuronal activity in memory consolidation and the neural circuitry involved.
Our overarching hypothesis is that VTA-DA activity during sleep is critically involved in the consolidation of
recent salient experiences into long-term memories via reactivation of salient facets of waking experience,
bidirectional communication with the HC and modulation of dopamine release in downstream target structures.
We will test this hypothesis using optical and electrophysiological recordings of neural activity and closed-loop
optogenetic manipulations of specific neural circuits in freely behaving, learning and sleeping mice. Guided by
strong preliminary data, we will first test which facets of waking experience are reactivated by VTA-DA neurons
during sleep and how and when this reactivation manifests at the population, ensemble and single-cell levels.
Next, we will determine the causal relationship between VTA-DA neuronal activity and HC sharp-wave ripples
during sleep. Finally, we will determine the memory function of dopamine release at major target regions
during sleep, using recording and inactivation paradigms.
These experiments will provide fundamental new insight regarding the role of VTA-DA neurons in consolidation
of salient experiences. These findings will shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying a key cognitive
function, and could promote the development of new therapeutic approaches for various psychiatric disorders
that are associated with a combination of dysregulated dopamine signaling and impaired memory."

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an Alzheimer's disease related dementia (ADRD) that has
a high mortality and disability burden. The deposition of amyloid around the blood vessels in the
brain leads to CAA. CAA is characterized by small cortical microbleeds in the brain, which not
only leads to devastating spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhages, but also contributes to
vascular dementia in the elderly. Interestingly, Alzheimer's disease (AD), a disease in which
amyloid deposits are found predominantly in the brain parenchyma rather than in the cerebral
blood vessels, has been increasingly recognized as a sexually dimorphic disease. In AD patients,
women perform poorly on verbal memory tasks and have a faster cognitive decline compared to
men. However, such differences are understudied in CAA, which shares a very similar disease
pathology of amyloid deposition. We and others have found sex differences in mouse models of
CAA across the lifespan. We have found that the fibrinolytic and inflammatory pathways are
sexually dimorphic in mouse models of CAA. The focus of this project will be on fibrinogen, which
is known to accumulate at sites of amyloid deposition, and activates microglia, leading to
inflammation, microbleeds, fibrosis and further cognitive decline. In this proposal, we will use mice
with genetic deletion of fibrinogen to determine the contributions of fibrin induced inflammation in
CAA. We will also use pharmacological inhibition of fibrin/fibrosis in mice with CAA using the drug
Pirfenidone, which is currently approved for use in patients with pulmonary fibrosis. By using
genetic and pharmacological manipulation, we will examine the complex interaction of fibrin with
microglia and it's downstream inflammatory pathways. We will also study the effect of this
interaction on cognition, number of microbleeds and amyloid burden in the brain at different ages
in both males and females. This will be the first step in understanding the complex interactions of
these pathways with sex and age in CAA progression. This work will fill the gap in our
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of sex differences in CAA pathology and vascular
dementia and may lead to the development of sex specific therapies for this devastating disease."

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating mental illness with limited available
personalized treatments. Recent Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have begun to elucidate
significant target genes implicated in this disease. One of these recently identified targets is the transcription
factor Foxp2. Foxp2 has been previously implicated in language learning disorders, however, its role in adult
fear learning is unknown. In adult mice, Foxp2 mRNA is expressed in clusters of Intercalated Cells surrounding
the basolateral amygdala. Intercalated Cells are functionally important for conditioned fear response and fear
extinction; however, the role of the Foxp2 transcription factor, its upstream mediators and downstream targets,
in modulating fear-related behaviors in the amygdala remains unknown. Recent evidence suggests that Foxp2
is regulated by multiple components of the Wnt signaling pathway and, in turn, acts in a feedback loop to
modulate regulation of Wnt pathway members. In this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that Foxp2 regulates
specific components of fear learning through its interaction with the Wnt signaling pathway in the Intercalated
Cells of the amygdala. In Aim 1, I will test transcriptional regulation of Foxp2 in the amygdala during fear
learning. I will perform a time-course analysis of Foxp2 transcription after fear learning using RT-PCR and
RNAscope. I will also use single nuclei sequencing following Foxp2 knockout to characterize Foxp2 targets in
specific cell types within amygdala after fear learning. Finally, I will perform fear-related behavioral
characterization with amygdala-specific Foxp2 knockout using male and female adult mice. In Aim2, I will
mechanistically test the hypothesis that Foxp2 is regulated by Wnt signaling pathway during fear learning,
building on prior work from the Ressler Lab that showed the role of Wnt signaling pathway components in adult
learning and memory. The outlined K08 proposal will build on my prior experience in developmental pathways,
molecular biology and genetics, while continuing training in a mammalian model of disease-relevant neural
circuitry. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to further my technical and professional skills while collecting
data that will form the basis for obtaining independent funding on a path to becoming an independent
Physician-Scientist."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in African Americans is one of the largest racial health disparities in the United
States. The cause for the increased risk has been attributed to recessive inheritance of allelic variants in the
gene for apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1). These APOL1 variants, known as G1 and G2, do not cause CKD on their
own, but CKD is caused by a combination of the inherited genetic risk plus exposure to a triggering environmental
stressor (a gene-environment interaction). Despite the association of CKD risk with APOL1 variants more than
ten years ago, the biological function of APOL1 in the kidney and the mechanism of pathogenesis in the setting
of a disease stressor remain unclear. Our long-term goal is to understand the genetics and biochemical
mechanism of CKD in African Americans caused by these APOL1 polymorphisms. To accomplish this goal, we
are studying HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN), the CKD most strongly associated APOL1 variants, and the
only CKD where the environmental stressor is known (HIV infection). HIVAN is an ideal disease model to dissect
biochemical pathways and cellular events intersected by APOL1 function, viral infection, and CKD. Our recent
studies have demonstrated, for the first time, a function for the common APOL1 allele, known as G0, in providing
protection against podocyte losses in HIVAN. Since APOL1 risk is a recessively inherited trait, this suggests
CKD may be caused, in part, by a loss-of-function process (i.e. absence of G0). In new preliminary data, G0
appears to associate with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in intracellular vesicles containing HIV and facilitate signaling
events initiated by interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, and these processes were absent with the APOL1 risk
variants. Methods will use established in vitro HIV infection of human podocyte cell lines, in vivo models of HIVAN
and BAC-APOL1 transgenic mice that replicate endogenous human APOL1 expression. Aims will examine both
initial response to HIV infection in podocytes, and long-term in vivo studies of intercrosses between the HIVAN
and BAC-APOL1 transgenic mice evaluating effects on renal function and pathology. These studies also will
establish temporal and magnitude of stressor-induced APOL1 expression, the mechanism of the altered innate
immune activation through TLRs to IRF-3/7 signaling, and effect on podocyte phenotype (survival and cell
adhesion). The dominance of the G0 protective effect over the risk variant dysfunction will be tested in podocytes
and mouse models co-expressing G0 and the risk variants. These studies should advance our understanding of
gain- versus loss-of-function mechanism associated with the recessive inheritance of APOL1 risk alleles, and
the necessity of induced APOL1 expression to drive stress responses. Determining the contribution of G0
function versus risk variant dysfunction will have important clinical impact on further therapy design, as it will
establish whether replacement of G0 or suppression of the risk variants would be the more effective strategy."

 The current opioid epidemic calls for global attention. Opioid use disorder is a chronical condition that
requires long-term comprehensive health services, from assessment, treatment, continuous monitoring, to
extended care. Medication-assisted therapy, although available as an effective strategy to treat opioid
addiction, has been significantly underutilized due to the hard-to-reach nature of people who use opioids
(PWUO) and the shortage of addiction specialist. An impetus for expanding and enhancing addiction treatment
is to mobilize community-based healthcare agencies and family members of PWUO. The study will take
advantage of the existing community health care infrastructure and family support systems in Vietnam to
develop and test an intervention to strengthen a continuum of addiction services. The intervention, entitled
“Community Care Consortium (CCC),” features community health workers’ joint effort with family members to
provide patient-centered, individualized addiction care and support. The intervention will be developed and
tested through three phases in three regions of Vietnam (Ninh Binh, Da Nang, and Can Tho). In Phase 1, we
will conduct formative studies with community health workers, community representatives, PWUO, and their
family members to identify barriers to addiction service utilization and discuss potential strategies to establish a
continuum of addiction services. Based on the formative study findings, the CCC intervention and its
implementation plans will be developed through workgroup meetings with researchers, community members,
and target users. In Phase 2, the CCC Intervention will be piloted in three communes and revised based on
acceptability/feasibility data, process evaluation, and feedback from field staff and participants. In Phase 3, a
randomized controlled trial of the CCC Intervention will be conducted in 60 communes, which will be
randomized to either an intervention condition or a control condition (30 in each condition). A total of 720
PWUO, 720 of their family members, and 180 commune health workers (CHW) will participate in the study.
The intervention outcomes on PWUO, CHW, and family members will be assessed with the data collected at
baseline, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups."
10862822,"An immense advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence has transformed many aspects
of our lives. The integration of artificial intelligence into the biomedical field allows us to solve complex biological
problems that are the bottle neck of developing progressive diagnostic and therapeutic tools. One example is
the need to manipulate the amino acid sequence of peptides to improve their function as bioactive molecules.
Embarking on these new technologies, we developed a new machine learning tool that is based on a discipline
known as “genetic programing” that can assist in designing new proteins and bioactive peptides. This new
technology, termed Protein Optimization Evolving Tool (POET), can generate a model that describes the
relationship between a peptide and its respective activity. Moreover, through cycles of protein evolution, we can
significantly improve the model and consequently generate peptides with substantially improved function.
 A major challenge of translating synthetic biology approaches to clinical treatment is the need to improve
the communication with biological circuits in vivo. To that end, we will leverage the immense potential of the
POET to produce proteins and peptides that can read and write information from and into cells.
 Here we seek to improve, test and implement this model into three related, yet, independent aims. In the
first aim, we will deploy the POET to develop an ultrasensitive peptide-based imaging agent for MRI based on
proton exchange. Our preliminary data shows that through only few cycles of peptide evolution we surpassed
the state-of-the-art similar peptides. In the second aim, we intend to use a similar approach to develop a novel
MRI imaging probe based on T1 relaxation. We will use a metabolic engineering approach to express and load
the peptide with Lanthanides, and the POET algorithm to improve the next generations. Lastly, in the third aim,
we will use the POET for discovering new peptides for drug and gene delivery. We will utilize a novel platform
for gene/drug delivery to test the efficiency of the peptides.
 All three aims will start with computational design of peptides followed by an in vitro testing and several
cycles of peptide evolution until the ultimate peptides are identified. All three aims will be ended by demonstration
of the utility of those peptides in a clinically relevant question in an in vivo model followed by non-invasive
imaging.
 We anticipate that this innovative approach will open up a new avenue for developing powerful bioactive
peptides and proteins to solve critical biological questions, and for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches that can vastly benefit the well-being of numerous patients."

 Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide insight to underlying etiologies of disease not obvious
through clinical evaluation or pathophysiology alone. Genetic variants associated with complex, often refractory
diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) may hold the key for the next generation
of treatment options. Leveraging genetic data with current standards of care and known pathophysiology can
provide a strong premise for mechanistic studies and novel drug targets. My current work studies the molecular
genetics of CD33 in AD under Dr. Steve Estus. CD33 normally acts to inhibit microglial activation in the brain,
suppressing amyloid clearance. We are investigating how the AD-protective single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) in CD33 modulates protein, and thereby cellular, function. This SNP leads to an increase in an alternative
CD33 protein isoform which, based on our recent genetic data, may promote—rather than suppress—microglial
activation. I will learn new technical skills during the F99 phase of this award, and I will use these skills as I switch
focus to MS and progress into the K00 phase to acquire additional, powerful techniques and models including
work with patient samples, pluripotent stem cells, single-cell sequencing technologies, and animal models.
 In Specific Aim 1, I detail how my training in molecular biology and genetic concepts has allowed me to
conceive independent hypotheses and carry out complex experiments. My doctoral work on the molecular
genetics of CD33 and its association with reduced AD risk has provided training in GWAS interpretation,
quantitative PCR, immunoassays such as Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation, and genetic techniques
including transfection and genome editing strategies in cell culture. In Specific Aim 2, I will continue to develop
as a scientist and finish my doctoral work, carrying out increasingly complex studies to include high-resolution
confocal imaging and subcellular localization, measuring time- and dose-dependent protein phosphorylation in
situ, gene expression arrays, and functional assays including phagocytosis in vitro. I will also continue developing
my professional skills such as oral and written communication, networking, and mentorship. In Specific Aim 3, I
will extend my doctoral training to include work with human tissue samples and mouse models of MS. I
have not yet identified a specific postdoctoral mentor, but my ideal mentor will have experience conducting
human subjects research, using mouse models of MS, and have a strong track record of training fellows to
become tenure-track faculty. I will identify a mentorship team to guide my technical and professional
development during this phase. I will leverage my current training in molecular genetics to identify MS-associated
functional SNPs, my training-in-progress to identify the mechanism behind these SNPs at the protein and
intracellular signaling levels, and my future training with murine models and human subjects to establish a high-
impact, translational career, combining genetic, clinical, and pathology findings for pharmacological
breakthroughs in neuroimmune diseases."

Summary (30 lines)
This proposal is a response to RFA-AG-23-010 Noncoding RNAs in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias. The overarching goal of the proposed study is to define and characterize key noncoding RNA
(ncRNA) regulators of mechanisms of biological resilience against cognitive loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
An individual who is resilient to AD-related neuropathology and does not show cognitive decline despite the
presence of AD-related neuropathology will be less likely to develop dementia later in life. A striking natural
subpopulation of the elderly remain cognitively intact while controlling or compensating for AD-related
pathology. As of yet, drug interventions targeting specific AD-related pathologies, such as β-amyloid,
neurofibrillary tangles, or neuroinflammation, have been largely ineffective in controlling AD pathology-related
cognitive decline - AD related dementia (AD/ADRD). A compelling alternative is to find ways to enhance
resilience against AD/ADRD. During aging, the fidelity of transcriptional regulatory processes declines with
associated loss of function and cognitive decline. Proper coding and noncoding gene expression regulation is
critical for maintaining homeostasis and preventing disease processes. ncRNAs are increasingly recognized
as potent, highly specific regulators of gene expression at all levels. ncRNAs play a critical role in cell stress
response. Given the large number of miRNA and lncRNA genes and gene/lncRNA/miRNA interactions and
the overarching role of these RNAs in normal processes of the cell, ncRNAs have enormous potential not only
as therapeutic targets and biomarkers for the pathologies of aging, but also as key intermediate mechanism
markers - helping define mechanisms of disease response that they regulate. We will perform the first study
that systematically identifies and characterizes novel ncRNA-regulated resilience mechanisms in AD; derived
from human subject data. This project will establish a systematic framework for identification of resilience
processes, to explain the roles of ncRNAs in resilience to AD at the cellular and molecular level. Our
comprehensive approach will uncover the role of ncRNA factors of resilience to cognitive decline. Using
systematic analysis of cognitively resilient populations and powerful tools that identify resilience lncRNAs and
miRNAs, we will identify and characterize the interactions, functions and targets of prioritized resilience-
associated ncRNAs in our in vitro neuronal/glial cell culture models and advanced three-dimensional (3D)
human neural cell culture models of AD. The team brings together broad and deep inter-disciplinary expertise
in ncRNA biology, systems biology and Alzheimer’s disease pathology, with a solid basic and translational
science background to address understanding of ncRNA in aging (Slack), ncRNA targeting (Vlachos),
systems biology of complex disease (Hide) and expertise in 3D AD model systems (Kim) and AD (Tanzi)."
10808115,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Uncontrolled bleeding following trauma represents a significant clinical problem; exsanguination is the major
cause of death in both civilian and battlefield traumas. If hemostasis is achieved, wound repair following trauma
can be impeded by several complications including infection, keloid formation, insufficient blood flow and a
compromised immune system. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) also frequently occurs concurrently with hemorrhage
following trauma and is associated with high risks of infection. Infections are a leading cause of mortality,
morbidity, and economic disruption around the world, highlighting the need for better methods to achieve
hemostasis and improve wound healing following trauma. Clot formation is critical to the cessation of bleeding
and involves the formation of a platelet plug embedded within a fibrin mesh. Platelets bind multiple fibrin fibers
and actively apply forces to contract the network, thereby stabilizing the developing clot. Furthermore, platelet-
mediated clot contraction is thought to augment wound healing following cessation of bleeding by reestablishing
blood flow to downstream tissues and by providing mechanical stimulation to surrounding cells. We have recently
developed platelet-like particles (PLPs) created from highly deformable microgels (gels) conjugated to wound-
targeting motifs, which specifically target wound environments through high affinity binding to the provisional
matrix protein fibrin. Our prior studies demonstrate that PLPs recapitulate a number of functions of natural
platelets, including augmentation of clotting of adult plasma in vitro, decreased bleeding times in rodent models
of traumatic injury, specific homing to injury sites, induction of clot contraction, and enhancement of wound
repair in rodent models of dermal injury. We have also shown in a rodent model of TBI that PLPs decrease blood
brain barrier (BBB) permeability and neuroinflammation after injury.
 The long-term goal of this project is to develop intravenous hemostatic PLPs that are triggered by the
body’s native clotting cascade to promote clotting and, following hemostasis, augment wound healing. Our central
hypothesis is that the combination of PLP-mediated clot contraction and delivery of antimicrobial nanosilver will
significantly improve wound healing following traumatic injury by providing mechanical stimulation to
surrounding cells and by preventing/treating infection. This proposal will specifically evaluate stability and safety
of antimicrobial nanosilver containing PLPs. The effectiveness of these particles will then be evaluated in a mouse
model of bleeding and healing in the absence or presence of infection. Additionally, particle efficacy, safety, and
immune system modulation will be evaluated in a rodent polytrauma model of combined traumatic brain injury
(TBI) and hemorrhage."

The reprogramming of somatic human cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by only four transcription
factors (TFs) Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (OSKM) is one of the most striking remodelings of gene regulatory
networks. The remarkable ability of OSKM to reprogram diverse somatic cell types into iPSCs that are
functionally indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells indicates that OSKM leverages a fundamental
mechanism for network remodeling that may be generally applicable to all cell fate transitions. Previous studies
of reprogramming have identified the crucial role of cooperative TF binding in repressing somatic programs and
activating pluripotent ones. However, associating TF binding dynamics and epigenomic remodeling with key
bifurcation events during reprogramming is confounded by the highly heterogeneous nature of the
reprogramming process and the lack of knowledge regarding how the transition from somatic to pluripotent
regulatory programs occurs in individual cells. In this project, we aim to model the regulatory network underlying
the cell fate change of reprogramming using three types of single-cell multi-omic profiles generated from critical
time points during reprogramming. We will interrogate the network leveraging natural perturbation of
reprogramming and pluripotency by genetic variants. Genetic variation is well known to modulate the regulatory
network of pluripotency and contributes to the variability of cellular phenotypes and differentiation capacity of
iPSC lines. We will generate population-scale single-cell joint profiling of RNA and DNA methylation (snmCT-
seq), joint profiling of RNA and chromatin accessibility (scRNA + ATAC-seq) and single-nucleus joint profiling of
chromatin conformation and DNA methylation (sn-m3C-seq), allowing the cell-type-specific determination of
transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and methylation states at regulatory elements, as well as enhancer-gene
looping to connect non-coding variants to their regulatory target. To integrate OSKM binding with the single-cell
transcriptomic and epigenomic dynamics, we will determine the allele-specific binding of TFs and histone
modifications using a pooled-alleles ChIP-seq strategy. We will use Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM)
to construct predictive models by integrating transcription factor-gene interaction information with time- and
pseudotime-series genomics data. To determine the genetic regulation of the reprogramming network, we will
apply the novel statistical method FastGxE to distinguish cell-type-specific from the shared genetic component
of gene expression regulation, to enhance the sensitivity for identifying cell-type-specific quantitative trait loci
(QTLs). To test the regulatory network, we will experimentally determine the function of network hub genes and
non-coding variants using high-throughput CRISPR interference and precise variant replacement experiments.
Our proposed project integrates diverse approaches including single-cell multi-omics, computational modeling,
and genetic engineering, and will likely provide new insights into the mechanism by which TFs remodel regulatory
networks of cell type identity and serve as a model for similar analyses in other systems."

Genetic mutations causing disease may be inherited, newly acquired in parental gametes and present in the
zygote, or acquired at some point in development after fertilization. The burden and localization of a post-
zygotically acquired mutation depends on when the mutation arises. Malformations of cortical development
(MCD) are a group of disorders characterized by a range of morphological and structural abnormalities of the
cerebral cortex reflecting errors in embryonic cortical development. MCD are associated with refractory
epilepsy as well as intellectual disability and may require the surgical removal of the affected tissue for seizure
control. There is increasing recognition that post-zygotically acquired somatic mutations occurring in neuroglial
progenitor cells can result in a cortical brain malformation. In the previous funding period of this grant, we
made significant progress identifying and molecularly characterizing a series of pathogenic post-zygotically
acquired somatic variants in the resected brain tissue of individuals with an epilepsy-associated cortical brain
malformation. Most notably we identified and functionally characterized the first gene associated with focal
cortical dysplasia type I, SLC35A2, and made significant advancements in the understanding of the somatic
genetic landscape across MCD. The overarching objective for the next funding cycle is to continue to identify
somatic variants across MCD and to functionally characterize the effects of novel variants associated with
different types of MCD on cortical development. In Aim 1, we will continue to collect resected brain tissue
specimens from individuals with MCD for high-depth exome or targeted gene sequencing. The goal of Aim 1 is
to identify novel genes involved in MCD and to ascertain the subset of exome-negative cases for use in Aim 2.
In Aim 2, we will use highly sensitive duplex sequencing to detect very low-level somatic variants and PCR-free
whole-genome sequencing to detect somatic short tandem repeat variants and intermediately sized somatic
copy number variants in exome-negative MCD cases. The goal of Aim 2 is to determine the contribution of
these classes of somatic variants that are routinely missed due to the limitations of standard short-read exome
sequencing in the overall somatic genetic risk of MCD. Finally, Aim 3 will evaluate the functional consequences
of knocking out newly identified MCD genes harboring somatic loss-of-function variants on neuronal
morphology, neuronal migration, and ultimately cerebral cortical development in the developing mouse brain.
These studies will: (i) continue our in-depth assessment of the role of somatic mutations across MCD
subtypes, (ii) identify novel genes/pathways involved in cortical development, (iii) use complementary in vitro,
ex vivo, and in vivo models to understand the role of novel genes implicated cortical development, and (iv)
establish biomarkers and platforms that can be used in the future for screening of compounds to possibly
prevent or improve the prognosis of MCD."

 Despite recent advances in cancer metabolism, whether and how nutritional interventions affect tumor
development, metastasis and therapeutic response are still poorly understood. Thus, the goal of this study is to
elucidate the effect of glutamine supplementation on tumor development and therapeutic responses, and
eventually provide molecular evidence that nutritional interventions on cancer patients can inhibit tumor growth
and sensitize tumors to treatments. Using metabolomic analysis, we and others have found that, compared to
other amino acids, many solid tumor cells are situated in a glutamine poor environment in vivo. Interestingly, we
found that glutamine deficiency in melanoma tumors resulted in cancer cell de-differentiation and resistance to
treatment due to increased histone methylation levels. This finding further prompted us to test if increases in
glutamine levels through dietary supplementation can be detrimental to tumor cells that have been well adapted
to a low glutamine environment. Our preliminary data demonstrated that supplementation of glutamine in the diet
is sufficient to increase tumoral α-ketoglutarate levels and leads to decreased histone methylation in melanoma
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors. Importantly, we found that high glutamine diet significantly hinders tumor
growth and decreases expression of melanoma-associated oncogenes compared to control diet. In support with
this, accumulating evidence from in vivo experiments demonstrate that glutamine is not an essential nutritional
source to support TCA cycle and tumor growth. Thus, we hypothesize that dietary glutamine supplementation
inhibits melanoma tumor growth and sensitizes tumor cells to current treatments via epigenetic reprogramming.
In this proposal, we will 1) determine the effect of dietary glutamine supplementation on melanoma tumor growth,
metabolism and oncogene expression in vivo; 2) determine the molecular mechanisms by which glutamine
supplementation inhibits tumor growth; 3) investigate the effect of glutamine supplementation in response to
BRAF/MEK inhibitors and immunotherapy for melanoma treatment. Despite many proven clinical benefits of
glutamine supplementation to cancer patients, recent in vitro studies showing that tumor cells are avid glutamine
consumers led to cautionary usage of dietary glutamine on cancer patients. Completion of the proposed studies
will provide insight into glutamine driven epigenetic regulation and its effect on tumor growth. The results of these
studies will reveal a novel therapeutic direction for using dietary glutamine supplementation to prevent tumor
growth and enhance therapeutic responses without detrimental side effects."

The persistent gap in our understanding of ocular surface immunomodulation is a barrier for developing new
therapies for inflammatory disorders that are responsible for a bulk of outpatient visits to an ophthalmologist.
Previous publications from our laboratory established that the secreted Ly6/uPAR related protein-1 (SLURP1),
a member of the Ly6 family of proteins is an immunomodulatory molecule at the ocular surface that: (i) is highly
expressed in the corneal epithelium and secreted to the tear fluid; (ii) acts as a soluble scavenger of urokinase-
type plasminogen activator (uPA); (iii) inhibits human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation;
(iv) suppresses neutrophil chemotaxis and transmigration through confluent endothelial monolayer in vitro; and
(v) stabilizes epithelial cell junctions and suppresses TNF-α-induced cytokine production consistent with an
anti-inflammatory function. Collectively, these studies identified SLURP1 as a potential therapeutic target for
inflammatory disorders of the ocular surface. Here we propose to build upon these salient findings by testing
the central hypothesis that ‘SLURP1 suppresses corneal angiogenic inflammation and neutrophil recruitment
by regulating the TGF-β- and uPA-activities that promote NFκB-mediated production of pro-inflammatory
molecules’. This hypothesis is supported by our prior publications described above, and exciting results from
our unpublished preliminary studies wherein Slurp1 knockout (Slurp1X-/-) mouse corneas displayed dense
corneal neovascularization and excessive neutrophil influx five days after silver nitrate cautery. Furthermore,
RNA-Seq comparison of the naïve wild type and Slurp1X-/- mouse corneal transcriptomes identified key
activators of angiogenic inflammation including TGF-β and NFκB pathway components to be upregulated in
the absence of Slurp1, lending additional support for this hypothesis. We will test this hypothesis by employing
mouse models and in vitro studies to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1). Test the hypothesis that
Slurp1 protects the cornea from undesirable angiogenic inflammation by suppressing unmitigated TGF-β and
uPA activities that feed into NFκB pathway; Aim 2). Test the hypothesis that Slurp1 suppresses neutrophil
influx into healthy corneas by promoting neutrophil maturation and clearance, and interfering with their
extravasation; and Aim 3). Test the hypothesis that SLURP1 is negatively correlated with the severity of
human dry eye disease and a useful therapeutic target for ocular surface inflammatory disorders. By
elucidating promising new information related to the immunomodulatory functions of SLURP1, an abundantly
expressed yet understudied protein, anticipated outcomes of this proposal directly address the NIH mission of
‘seeking fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems’ and offer the potential for
validating a novel therapeutic target for inflammatory disorders of the ocular surface that account for a
significant burden on our healthcare system."

10879023,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Injury to the cerebral cortex occurs frequently across the spectrum of severity in traumatic brain injury (TBI). No
therapies exist to counter the neurological and cognitive deficits caused by these injuries, which are
responsible for substantial disability after TBI. A promising strategy for restoring brain function after injury is
cell replacement. Neural tissues that connect with host cortex locally and function as supplementary cortical
processing modules are especially intriguing candidates for this approach. Currently available tissue substrates
that are suitable for translation, including human brain organoids derived from patient-matched stem cell lines,
do not fully recapitulate the architecture or micro-circuitry of cortex. However, they can still be used to
investigate outstanding questions regarding neural tissue integration with the host brain. One essential issue
that has not been examined systemically is the optimal timing of cell replacement after TBI. The overall
objective of the current proposal is to evaluate how the interplay between the timing of neural tissue
transplantation after TBI and the state of the cortical microenvironment affects anatomic and functional
outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that acute neural tissue transplantation after TBI and removal of the injury
perimeter will improve outcomes as a result of enhanced integration of graft neurons with host brain networks
and maintenance of host cortex integrity. To test this hypothesis, we will transplant human cortical organoids
into rat visual cortex in the chronic or acute setting after a controlled cortical impact injury and assess anatomic
and functional outcome measures. In Aim 1, organoids will be transplanted directly into a chronic injury cavity
or after resection of the glial scar at the border of the cavity. In Aim 2, organoid grafts will be inserted directly
into an acute injury cavity or after the injury margin as been removed. In both of these Aims, organoid health
and cell composition as well as host cortex integrity will be assessed histologically. The extent of formation of
graft efferents (green fluorescent protein tracing) and afferents (modified rabies virus system for retrograde
trans-synaptic tracing) also will be determined. Functional integration of organoid grafts with the host cortex will
be investigated using in vivo techniques for recording extracellular neural activity and visual stimulation of the
host animal. In Aim 3, we will examine how modulating the activity of organoids using optogenetic stimulation
impacts their connectivity and integration with the chronically or acutely injured brain. The proposed research is
innovative in its use of human brain organoids as structured neural tissues for cortical repair after TBI and
because it explicitly assesses how the timing of transplantation affects outcomes. We expect that the proposed
studies will elucidate conditions that result in improved outcomes after organoid transplantation while also
identifying the limitations of currently available neural tissue substrates. These expected outcomes will
advance the field of cortical repair after TBI by reinvigorating the concept of cell replacement therapy and
inspiring novel strategies for modulating graft integration with the brain to achieve specific therapeutic goals."

This proposal focuses on genetic determinants underlying human hematopoiesis, specifically the development
of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and their precursors. There is considerable interest in augmenting in
vitro HPC production from cultured induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), as this would support research and
development of many blood cell-based therapies. To better understand genes and genomic loci that might
improve in vitro blood cell yields, I used computational modeling to analyze blood trait genome wide
association study (GWAS) data. I identified and validated Tropomyosin 1 as a gene that normally constrains in
vitro production of HPCs and their endothelial precursor cells. In Aim 1 of this grant, I will determine
mechanisms by which Tropomyosin 1 regulates HPC precursor development using well-defined in vitro iPSC
culture models. In Aim 2, I will define other genes and genetic mechanisms that regulate HPC biology using
novel adaptations of complementary statistical genetics approaches.
The proposed five-year training program outlines development of my research career as an academic pediatric
physician-scientist seeking to develop a research program investigating genetic mechanisms that regulate
hematopoiesis. I completed an MD and PhD in cell and molecular hematology, pediatrics residency training,
and am currently in my third year of fellowship training in neonatal and perinatal medicine at the Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The proposed research will be carried out under the mentorship of Benjamin
Voight, PhD, a leader in the field of complex human genetics; Stella Chou, MD, a leader in iPSC-derived
hematopoiesis and transfusion medicine; and Deborah French, PhD, a leader in iPSC manipulation,
hematopoietic culture, and blood cell biology. In addition, I am supported by an advisory committee composed
of scientists and physician-scientists in relevant and complementary fields, who have together supported
multiple K-award trainees. I have secured complete support from my institution, and will benefit from
exceptional didactic training, extensive resources and core facilities, and world-class mentorship available at
CHOP and the University of Pennsylvania for the duration of this award period. Training in an ideal academic
environment, afforded by K99 support, will help me develop the skills required to become an independent
physician-scientist studying hematopoiesis genetics during the R00 phase of this award.
My goal is to run a laboratory that uses computational and biochemical approaches to understand genetic
mechanisms and therapeutic strategies that enhance blood production. In this grant, I will obtain rigorous
training in data science and hematopoiesis modeling. This will expand my repertoire of skills, propel my
transition to independence, and increase my likelihood of success competing for R01 funding."
10839391,"Abstract:
Etv4 and Etv5 (Etv4/5) are two transcription factors expressed in the developing mouse kidney, specifically in
the ureteric bud tips, the metanephric mesenchyme and the renal vesicle.
Our preliminary data using a mouse model of Etv4/5 deletion in the nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and their
progeny demonstrate a critical role for these transcription factors during nephrogenesis; absence of Etv4/5
cause premature NPC exhaustion, thinning nephrogenic zone and hypoplastic/cystic kidneys at birth. In
addition, these mutants present segmentation defects as early as the s-shape body stage. We have generated
RNAseq data from NPC mutant and littermate control embryonic kidneys and identified Wnt4 as a downstream
target of Etv4/5.
Based on these preliminary data we hypothesize that Etv4/5 modulate nephrogenesis, at least in part, by
downregulating Wnt signaling in the NPCs and in the developing nephron. We further hypothesize that this
downregulation is required to favor both self-renewal of NPCs and differentiation of the early nephron.
We will test these hypotheses in two aims. In aim one we will investigate the crosstalk between Fgfs, Etv4/5
and Wnt4 signaling to promote self-renewal/prevent differentiation of the NPCs. In aim two we will investigate
how Etv4/5 and Wnt4 signaling affect nephron differentiation. These studies will provide further insight into the
signaling network driving progenitor self-renewal and differentiation; they will also expand our knowledge of the
cellular readout of Etv4 and Etv5 expression, therefore having a significant impact not only on the field of
developmental biology but also in cancer and in vitro organogenesis."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and the aggregation of amyloid-b
(Ab) and tau. The selective vulnerability of different brain regions and some cell types to AD pathology has been
established. However, much remains unknown regarding the disease-relevant mechanisms underlying this
differential response. We have previously used single-cell transcriptomics to perform an unbiased
characterization of vulnerable and resistant neuronal subtypes in the human AD brain (19 excitatory and 24
inhibitory subtypes; ~490,000 nuclei, multi-region dataset). This characterization revealed early transcriptional
changes in inhibitory interneurons, particularly in a population expressing the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit.
Using our novel method to isolate by FACS and profile neuronal somas with tau aggregates, we also quantified
the susceptibility of 20 major neocortical neuronal subtypes to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).
Although interneurons proved generally resistant to NFT formation, they were not spared from death. Our work
in the human brain highlights the existence of shared and distinct Ab- and tau-associated pathogenic
mechanisms as well as the need for a multidimensional approach to characterizing vulnerability in AD. This
proposal seeks to further characterize cell type-specific signatures of vulnerability to Ab and tau proteinopathies
in newly developed knock-in (KI) humanized mouse models of AD. We will test the hypothesis that early changes
in specific populations of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons, including c-Kit cells, are associated with network
dysfunction, early protein aggregation, and cognitive deficits in humanized AD mouse models. To model
pathogenic interactions between Ab and tau, we will use mouse models expressing humanized Ab without or
with familial AD (FAD) mutations and mouse models expressing human MAPT without or with a mutation
associated with tauopathy. In Aim 1, we will apply combined single-cell RNA- and ATAC-seq to tau-bearing and
tau-free somas from mice characterized behaviorally and electrophysiologically by chronic EEG/EMG recordings
and by standard and machine learning-analyzed behavior. In Aim 2, we will use spatial multiomics with single-
cell and subcellular resolution to map cell-type-specific vulnerabilities and cell-cell interactions in relation to Ab
and tau proteinopathies. In Aim 3, we will determine if Ab and/or tau alter the molecular, cellular, and circuit
properties of vulnerable c-Kit interneurons. In all aims, we will integrate our multiomics and functional data and
compare our mouse and previously-generated human data to identify evolutionarily conserved or species-
specific cell type behaviors. The completion of these aims will provide a human disease-relevant, large-scale
multiomics dataset instrumental to unravelling the mechanisms of neurodegeneration associated with Ab and
tau proteinopathies."
10818467,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
CEACAM1 is a single-pass type I transmembrane protein and the primordial member of the carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) family of immunoglobulin molecules that is expressed on the apical and basolateral surfaces of
intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and on a wide range of immune cell types. However, its functions on intestinal
epithelial cells (IECs) are unknown. The current research proposal addresses the unanswered question of
whether CEACAM1 acts to convert microbial or host signals from the apical and/or basolateral surface into the
production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) by IECs. The ability of the IEC to sense the presence of microbes
and deliver antimicrobial peptides (AMP) into the lumen represents a major mechanism of mucosal defense. Our
long-term goals are to determine whether CEACAM1-mediated stimulation of AMPs protects from commensal
and pathogenic microbe invasion of the IEC and susceptibility to colitis, the vectoral direction required for this
stimulation (apical and/or basolateral), whether it is specifically dependent upon CEACAM1 isoforms with a short
(S) cytoplasmic tail and if high-affinity ligands for CEACAM1 can be developed to stimulate these protective
activities. The objective of this research is to elucidate how CEACAM1 stimulates AMP production and whether
this information together can be co-opted for therapeutic purposes. Our central hypothesis is that CEACAM1
functions as a novel microbial sensor that responds to specific microbes or host ligands with production of AMPs
that are important to barrier protection. This rationale is derived from recent studies that a specific deficiency of
CEACAM1 in mouse IEC in vivo leads to decreased AMP expression by IECs coupled to increased susceptibility
to colitis and invasion by pathogenic microbes. Our central hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1)
Determine whether IEC-associated CEACAM1 regulates the production of AMP and host susceptibility to colitis
and enteropathogens; 2) Determine whether specific CEACAM1 isoforms are responsible for delivering activat-
ing signals to induce AMPs, and; 3) Define a therapeutic strategy to enhance human CEACAM1 ligands that
interact homophilically to induce these protective responses. In Aim 1, we will determine the innate and/or adap-
tive origins of the intestinal inflammation that ensues from CEACAM1-deficiency in the IEC and whether this
involves increased bacterial translocation of founding populations in the lumen. Aim 2 will determine whether
CEACAM1-S isoforms can stimulate IECs to produce AMPs in response to pharmacologic and microbial signals
and whether such stimulation can occur in response to ligation of CEACAM1 on the apical and basolateral sur-
faces. In Aim 3, we seek to generate human CEACAM1 variants with enhanced ability to stimulate IEC produc-
tion of AMP in vitro and in vivo and as such provide protection from experimental colitis. Overall, this proposal is
significant because it will define CEACAM1 as a microbial sensor, identify novel microbial sources as ligands for
CEACAM1 and create high-affinity ligands with therapeutic potential that together have important implications
for inflammatory bowel disease and mucosal defense mechanisms."
10764711,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Filarial nematodes of the family Onchocercidae cause debilitating human diseases, such as lymphatic
filariasis. As approximately 150 million individuals are currently infected with these nematodes, obtaining in-
depth knowledge of pathogen biology will serve to address a global health issue. It is known that the filarial
nematode, Brugia malayi, harbors an intracellular endosymbiotic bacterium of the Wolbachia genus, and this
relationship is essential; clearance of Wolbachia from the nematode with antibiotics leads to eventual nematode
death. Understanding the mechanisms by which Wolbachia maintains its intracellular survival within nematodes
would therefore likely provide an important avenue towards controlling pathogenic nematode populations, but
both Brugia and Wolbachia are not amenable to genetic manipulations. Discoveries of important
bacterium:nematode interactions at the molecular level, therefore, have proven exceedingly difficult.
 In this proposal, our goals are to utilize proteins from Wolbachia to genetically and biochemically dissect
conserved pathways of endolysosomal membrane dynamics in yeast. These secreted “effector” proteins are
known to alter host processes in order to support the survival of the bacterium in the eukaryotic host and to
ensure its own reproduction, and are therefore potent reagents that impact eukaryotic physiology. To this end,
my laboratory has employed the budding yeast, Saccharomoyces cerevisiae (Sce), as a model system towards
the discovery of bacterial proteins that modulate eukaryotic cellular biology, with a focus on those proteins which
inhibit intracellular membrane fusion and protein trafficking pathways.
 In a previous screen of candidate wBm secreted effector proteins, we have already identified proteins
from wBm that have the ability to manipulate eukaryotic biology. In this work, we show that one such protein,
wBm0152, strongly inhibits endosome:vacuole trafficking pathways in vitro. This inhibition appears to result from
modulation of the conserved ESCRT complex. As wBm is known to alter membrane dynamics in its host during
its symbiosis, and coupled with the fact that regulation of membrane dynamics is strongly conserved throughout
eukaryotes, the detailed genetic, molecular, and biochemical studies carried out in this proposal will be applicable
to wBm:B. malayi interactions, and thus, human filarial diseases. Finally, leveraging our laboratory's strengths
in microbiology, cellular biology, and protein/ lipid biochemistry, we will carefully detail the biochemical activity of
this Wolbachia-derived ESCRT modulator and identify important regulators and binding partners in yeast, which
are likely conserved in Brugia. This work will begin to describe heretofore unknown wBm:B. malayi interactions,
thus providing novel insight into not only Brugia physiology, but also provide new insight into ESCRT-dependent
activities in eukaryotes."
10929387,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: In children with tracheostomy (an artificial airway placed for upper airway
abnormalities or chronic illness progression), bacterial respiratory infections are the most common reason for
hospital admission, accounting for over 4600 hospitalizations and $300 million in U.S. hospital charges each
year. Despite being the most common reason for hospital admission, there is limited evidence for the treatment
of bacterial tracheostomy-associated infections (bTRAINs; bacterial pneumonia and/or tracheitis) in children.
The overall objective of the current application is to evaluate what factors influence clinicians to diagnose and
treat suspected bTRAINs with antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), a bacterium with limited oral
antibiotic options, is a common cause of bTRAINs. Because Pa causes 60% of bTRAINs, some clinicians
presumptively treat for Pa while awaiting test results. However, because Pa growth is also common in
respiratory cultures from patients with tracheostomy without clinical bTRAIN symptoms, some clinicians do not
use Pa-targeted antibiotics when Pa is recovered on respiratory culture. Our preliminary data demonstrates
wide variations in hospital-level diagnostic testing and treatment care practices in this population that are not
associated with clinical outcomes, common use of empiric Pa-targeted antibiotics, and absence of differential
outcomes when Pa is detected, regardless of receiving Pa-targeted antibiotics. Through development of a
consortium of five freestanding children's hospitals, we will prospectively collect data on 1500 hospitalizations
in children with tracheostomy and complete the following specific aims: 1) To determine the impact of rapid
respiratory viral testing on continued antibiotic treatment in children with suspected bTRAINs; 2) To identify
clinical and laboratory factors associated with antibiotic overuse in children with tracheostomy treated for
bTRAINs; and 3) To define the association between bacteria-discordant antibiotic coverage, culture results and
clinical outcomes in children hospitalized with bTRAINs and Pa-positive respiratory cultures. This will be the
first multicenter prospective study in respiratory infections in children with tracheostomy. Findings will provide
the necessary groundwork to design and implement targeted intervention trials to address heterogeneity in
bTRAIN diagnosis and management, which may lead to decreased broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure and
better long-term outcomes in a vulnerable population with high healthcare utilization. The proposal is
responsive to the current program announcement (PA-16-423) and the AHRQ's mission to promote
appropriate antibiotic use by “improv[ing] the appropriateness of antibiotic selection” through identifying “factors
influencing prescriber decisions about the use and choice of antibiotics” and by examining “the role of rapid
diagnostics in improving antibiotic use, including how rapid diagnostics should be integrated into clinicians'
decision making about antibiotic use.” This proposal also studies several AHRQ priority populations, including
children, low income populations, individuals with disabilities, and individuals who need chronic health care."

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a major medical burden, afflicting more than half of women at least once in their
lifetime, and generating more than $2 billion of healthcare costs annually in the United States. UTI is typically
considered a mild medical condition in healthy adults and is readily cured by oral antibiotics. However, hosts with
aberrant antimicrobial defenses or metabolic dysfunction, such as type 2 diabetes, are twice as likely to develop
UTI and often develop complications including recurrent UTI, pyelonephritis, and urosepsis. Certain pathogens,
such as Group B Streptococcus (GBS) are curiously over-represented in diabetes, and may highlight unique
deficiencies in host urinary defenses in these patients. The goal of this proposed research is to identify the
dysfunctional molecular pathways of the diabetic urogenital tract conferring heightened susceptibility, increased
virulence, and/or increased colonization by GBS. Our published and preliminary studies show deficient urinary
antimicrobial defense factors and amplified GBS UTI susceptibility in diabetic mice, enhanced GBS fitness in
diabetic levels of glucose, and increased GBS vaginal colonization in diabetic mice. These data support the
central hypothesis that aberrant function of essential urinary defenses, augmented bacterial virulence, and/or
disparate vaginal microbiota enhance susceptibility to GBS urogenital infection in type 2 diabetes. This
hypothesis will be interrogated through the following specific aims: 1) Interrogate the role of Tamm-Horsfall
glycoprotein (THP) in epithelial defense and immune modulation during GBS UTI, 2) Assess impact of urinary
glucose levels on GBS bladder colonization and urinary tract immune responses, and 3) Define the impact of
host metabolism and the vaginal microbiota on GBS colonization. These aims are advanced using multiple
innovative tools including longitudinal glycan analyses, high-throughput cultivation of vaginal microbial
communities, bioluminescent bacterial imaging, transgenic mouse lines, recently established humanized
microbiota models of GBS vaginal colonization, and modern microbiome and metabolome profiling. This
research takes place in the dynamic and interdisciplinary environment of Baylor College of Medicine with diverse
expertise in GBS-host interactions, microbiome characterization and cultivation, and clinical management of type
2 diabetes. This research strategy seeks to more fully understand the complex processes diminishing host
defenses during metabolic disease to inform new therapeutic targets that can treat or prevent UTI in both healthy
individuals and those with type 2 diabetes."

In this proposal, we will study the long-term cardiovascular sequelae of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI),
therapies that have revolutionized cancer treatment. We will use both mouse models and cancer survivors
treated with ICI. We have defined acute, T cell mediated cardiac complications of ICI, including myocarditis,
pericarditis, and vasculitis as a significant clinical concern in these patients. Our preliminary data suggest a
role for programmed death-1/ligand-1 (PD-1/PD-L1) in preventing myocardial injury and other cardiovascular
disease. Clinically, we have observed patients with subacute cardiac injury following ICI treatment. We
hypothesize that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade through ICI therapy, in conjunction with other cardiac insults, worsens
long-term cardiovascular health. To address this, we will first utilize two mouse models that we have developed
that recapitulate ICI-cardiopulmonary toxicities: a model (MRL/MpJ) treated with combination ICI therapy, and
a genetic knockout model (PD1-/-; CTLA+/-). In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that cardiac ischemia
potentiates increased immune infiltration and inflammation in our pharmacologic and genetic mouse models
(compared to appropriate controls), performing in-depth physiologic and immune profiling in these mouse
models. We leverage these mechanistic and pre-clinical models with translational endpoints for Aim 2, where
we will utilize a large retrospective cohort of long-term survivors treated with ICI (200 patients) to assess the
impact of ICI on cardiac risk factors, including blood pressure, weight, body composition, and coronary artery
calcification. A prospective cohort (150 patients) will be accrued for longitudinal clinical phenotyping to identify
and validate clinical endpoints and to extend and validate these findings. We will perform intensive cardiac
(echocardiography, cardiac MRI, high-sensitivity troponin, C-reactive protein) and metabolic (fasting lipids and
glucose) monitoring, specifically testing the hypothesis that troponin elevation early in treatment with ICI
correlates with ventricular remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis. In patients who die following recovery from
myocarditis, we will perform rapid autopsies to determine the extent of inflammation, fibrosis, structural
changes, and residual immune cell populations.
The overwhelming success of ICI has led to a dramatic increase of long-term survivors treated with these
agents. This proposal will allow us to characterize the effects of ICI on long-term cardiovascular health, thus
enabling development of appropriate screening, treatment, and prevention strategies."

Background: Traditional scientific training prepares investigators to conduct scientific research, but does not
adequately prepare early-career investigators to lead and manage their own labs. Yet, when early-career
researchers launch their independent research laboratories, they are tasked with creating a productive, rigorous,
and supportive research environment. Good leadership and management practices can cultivate an effective
environment and the success of the lab. Conversely, poor management and leadership can result in high
turnover, reduced output, and lapses in scientific rigor and responsible conduct of research. Therefore, education
and mentoring is needed to foster leadership and management best practices.
Participants and Program Aims: The overall goal of this program, Leadership and Management Practices for
Scientists (LAMPS), is to develop a nationally accessible training and mentoring program for early-career faculty
researchers launching their independent labs. The program develops essential leadership and management
skills and provides practical tools and a personalized Lab Manual. We will apply findings from leadership and
management research, utilize novel training and mentoring methods, and engage members of the research
community to obtain feedback and encourage their support of LAMPS. The program aims to advance diversity
by recruiting and fostering the careers of members of historically underrepresented groups in the biomedical
sciences, and by increasing inclusive leadership and mentoring practices among LAMPS scholars.
Methods and Evaluation: Over the course of 5 years we will: 1) build an innovative, collaborative digital learning
environment to deliver a scientific leadership and management curriculum and scalable mentoring, 2) pilot test
and refine the program 3) recruit and provide the program to 100 early-career researchers per year, 4) implement
program outreach, dissemination, and sustainability plans, and 5) evaluate all research education program
components and track the career development of LAMPS scholars.
Team: An outstanding team of experts in industrial-organizational psychology, research ethics, diversity and
inclusion, and biology will develop, implement, and evaluate the LAMPS program.
Innovation and Impact: The LAMPS program is highly innovative and is grounded in research conducted by
our team and effective pedagogical methods. It is informed by relevant biomedical stakeholders and includes a
novel approach to peer mentoring for professional development. The novel and scalable digital learning
environment will be open to all junior faculty researchers at institutions across the nation. Practical tools related
to leadership and management will drive application of best practices in the laboratory, strengthening scholars'
ability to conduct impactful research. In turn, LAMPS will create a lasting positive impact in the biomedical
research community."
10886744,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Background: Cannabis is amongst the most commonly used drugs globally. The potency of cannabis has
increased, and the “medical” and recreational use of cannabis is increasingly being legalized across the U.S.
Perceptions of the risks of cannabis use amongst teenagers have declined over the past decade. The initiation
of cannabis use typically occurs during adolescence and young adulthood, when the brain is still developing and
is most vulnerable to insults, particularly drugs. Therefore, it is important to understand the consequences of
chronic cannabinoid exposure on the structure and function of the brain. Repeated administration of
cannabinoids to rodents has been shown to result in lower synaptic density. Consistently, we recently showed
lower synaptic vesicle density in the hippocampus in cannabis use disorder (CUD) participants as measured
using [11C]UCB-J, a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A
in vivo. CUD participants performed worse on a hippocampal verbal memory task, and verbal memory
performance correlated with hippocampal [11C]UCB-J binding. However, whether the lower hippocampal
synaptic density and deficits in memory performance normalize with abstinence from cannabis use is not known.
The purpose of this study is to compare synaptic vesicle density in CUDs before and after 4 weeks of abstinence
from cannabis use, and to relate changes in synaptic density to hippocampal function (verbal memory).
Furthermore, the relationship between hippocampal [11C]UCB-J binding, verbal memory, and measures of
cannabis exposure (age of first use and lifetime exposure) will be explored.
Hypotheses: CUDs will show an increase in both hippocampal [11C]UCB-J binding, and verbal memory
performance following 4 weeks of confirmed abstinence. In CUD participants, earlier age of cannabis use and
cumulative exposure to cannabis will be correlated to hippocampal [11C]UCB-J binding.
Methods: We will compare synaptic vesicle density in CUDs before and after 4 weeks of abstinence using
[11C]UCB-J PET and the High Resolution Research Tomograph. Age-, gender matched healthy controls (HCs)
will also be scanned at baseline and at 4 weeks in order to verify longer-term test-retest stability. The relationship
between hippocampal [11C]UCB-J binding, verbal memory, and measures of cannabis exposure (age of initiation
of use and lifetime exposure) will be explored in CUDs.
Pilot data: CUDs (n=12) show lower hippocampal SV2A and verbal memory, which are correlated. CUDs (n=2)
show an increase in [11C]UCB-J binding with confirmed abstinence from cannabis for ~4 weeks."
10918058,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Precision medicine requires an understanding of the origins and molecular control over complex traits and
disease. The field is largely driven by human genetics, which adheres to a 1918 dogma that phenotype is
determined solely by genetics and the environment. Yet, evidence from monozygotic twins and isogenic animal
models indicate that up to 50% of phenotypic variation across diverse physiological traits and diseases cannot
be explained by genetics or environment – there is something `more' that is unique to each individual, and that
cannot be determined by analyzing population-level mean effects. These findings also indicate that even if we
did have `complete' genetic and environmental knowledge, a substantial portion of disease heterogeneity would
remain unaccounted for. The operating hypothesis for this project is that a substantial fraction of unexplained
disease heterogeneity reflects inherently probabilistic properties of the biological system that lead to fixed,
deterministic, real biological variation. There is compelling evidence for an evolved molecular circuitry that
controls phenotypic variability as a quantitative trait. Thus, understanding variability as a quantitative trait is
essential to understanding the etiology of phenotypic diversity (in general) and an individual's disease potential
(in particular). Here, we will begin to finally answer the precision medicine questions of: what is the normal or
expected disease potential for me? And, what are the origins and regulatory controls of non-genetic, non-
environmental phenotypic and disease variability in humans? The first steps towards addressing these questions
and identifying mechanisms through which probabilistic processes lead to disease heterogeneity is to create a
catalogue of putative variance regulators and genes; a phenotypic, epigenetic, and cellular variance atlas
charting the landscape of probabilistic variation in an isogenic model system (mice); and, to demonstrate that
the regulatory architecture of variance control is conserved between mouse and humans. If it is true that a
significant portion of unexplained disease heterogeneity is due to the molecular control of variability itself, then
we will have uncovered an entirely new area of disease etiology that can be harnessed by the community to
develop fundamentally new predictive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions, irrespective of the disease of
interest."

 Artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are the mainstay antimalarial treatment combating
Plasmodium falciparum malaria around the world. While resistance is widespread in Asia, it has not yet been
observed in Africa where the majority of the global morbidity and mortality occurs. Artemisinin and ACT
resistance in Africa would be a serious setback as there are no next-generation antimalarials ready for
deployment. Recent reports in Rwanda of validated artemisinin resistance are of grave concern. A recent
therapeutic efficacy study in Rwanda found a high prevalence of patients with delayed parasite clearance,
which was associated with a validated artemisinin resistance mutation R561H in the K13 gene. Thus, it
appears Africa is moving closer to fully formed resistance, as seen in Southeast Asia. New evidence shows
that this mutation has arisen within Africa and was not spread from Asia, and thus, represents biology unique
to Africa. Given the potential devastating consequences of frank artemisinin resistance spreading across the
continent, this proposal is designed to improve our understanding of the mutation and its biology, its origin, its
past and ongoing spread and the factors that impact the spread. Understanding these dynamics is critical to
predicting the long-term effectiveness of ACTs and to evaluating and formulating effective control efforts. In
this proposal the first goal is to understand the extent of spread and how quickly it is changing with time. We
will leverage an extensive collaborative network within Rwanda and in surrounding countries to perform large
scale sampling and genomics studies across Rwanda and neighboring areas in other countries over time to
map and study the spread of resistance. This will be accomplished using high-throughput targeted sequencing
allowing us to genotype tens of thousands of samples. Using the generated rich genotyping and spatial data,
we will also ask questions about parasite migration and factors that may be impacting the spread. Our second
goal is to look for other mutations that may further support resistance to artemisinin or partner drugs. Based on
our knowledge from Southeast Asia, there are often compensatory mutations that increase the fitness of
artemisinin resistance mutations in K13. To detect compensatory mutations we will perform genome wide
association studies and longitudinal analyses. Our third goal is to study the relative fitness of mutant and wild

10885163,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The epithelial stem cells for the corneal epithelium and their immediate progeny, the early TA cells, are
preferentially located in the basal layer of the limbal epithelium and are key for maintaining corneal epithelial
homeostasis. The early TA cells migrate toward central cornea and populate the peripheral corneal epithelial
basal layer. The more mature or late TA cells are believed to reside in the central corneal epithelial basal layer.
This paradigm of corneal epithelial stem/TA cell/post-mitotic cell is over 30 years old and some of the features
of these three populations have been defined. However, due to the heterogeneity of the limbal and peripheral
corneal epithelial basal layer, it has been extremely difficult to isolate the stem/early TA cell population. Thus, it
was technically difficult for the characterization of stem vs early TA versus late TA cells. We have conducted
single cell RNA sequencing and established a single cell transcriptome for discrete limbal/corneal epithelial cell
populations. Unbiased clustering identified stem/early TA, late TA and differentiated epithelial cells. Using this
single cell transcriptome data, we discovered that ID3 was one of the highest expressed genes in stem cell
population. ID3 is a key regulator for maintaining stem cell homeostasis in several non-ocular tissues and not
previously recognized in corneal/limbal epithelium. ID3 proteins were specifically detected in stem cell-enriched
limbal epithelial basal layer and nearly undetectable in corneal epithelium. Depletion of ID3 in limbal epithelium
reduced the numbers of cells expressing putative limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) markers, suggesting that
ID3 plays a positive role in maintaining LESCs, which will be investigated in Aim1. Our preliminary data also
lead to the idea that LRRK1 is a positive regulator of ID3 in limbal epithelium via targeting CaMKIIb and/or
CTCF (Aim2) and LRRK1/CaMKIIb/CTCF/ID3 axis may help maintain LESCs (Aims1 and 2). To accomplish
these goals, we will capitalize on our ability to modulate LRRK1, ID3, CaMKIIb and CTCF levels in
complimentary model systems that include submerge cultured primary cells, 3-D organotypic raft cultures, and
mice. Dysregulation of ID3 is associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases (e.g., Sjögren's Syndrome).
Knowledge on how ID3 is regulated will translate into a better understanding of the pathogenesis of the
diseases with dysregulation of ID3. Since abnormal LESC homeostasis is involved in various corneal epithelial
disorders (e.g., diabetic cornea), the knowledge gained from this proposal may provide a rationale for
developing novel therapeutics based on modulating the expression of ID3 for treating these cornea diseases
associated with compromised LESCs."
10887484,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Health Communication and Social Needs Core
The primary goal of the Health Communication and Social Needs Core (HCSN) of the Washington University
Center for Diabetes Translation Research (WU-CDTR) is to provide expertise in health communication, health
literacy, and social needs methodology to support diabetes translation research. To eliminate health disparities in
diabetes outcomes and promote diabetes health equity, the HCSN will assist WU-CDTR investigators in
advancing the comprehension, use, and relevance of diabetes prevention information by priority populations;
addressing the complexities of how social needs impact diabetes outcomes and how such effects vary by
individuals and subgroups; and facilitating strategic community partnerships with non-health care and social
service agencies to further integrate social needs solutions into diabetes translation research. The unique
combination of health communication, health literacy, and social needs services provided by the HCSN Core
reflects the increasing importance and necessity of assuring the relevance of interventions for specific
populations. The Core refers to social determinants of health as system and policy influences on health, and
recognizes the need for supplementing efforts with acute safety net services for “social needs” such as food,
housing, and transportation that can interfere with diabetes management efforts. The HCSN Core focuses on
achieving diabetes equity for priority health disparity populations (e.g., Blacks/African Americans,
Hispanics/Latinos, socioeconomically disadvantaged rural populations, etc.) by enhancing the relevance and
impact of health information and incorporating new approaches for addressing social needs.
 The HCSN will assist WU-CDTR investigators to develop and apply the knowledge and skills needed to
translate research to improve diabetes outcomes, reduce disparities, and achieve health equity through the
following specific aims which will: (1) improve health communication and health literacy of diabetes information to
increase reach, comprehension, effectiveness, and use among priority populations; (2) advance the integration of
social needs data and solutions into diabetes translation research; and (3) build team capacity in the skills
essential for effective communication and integration of social needs into diabetes translation research.
 The HCSN Core will continue to bring together WU-CDTR scholars and underrepresented researchers
and provide them with services such as applying and integrating health communication and health literacy best
practices; developing and testing social needs interventions; facilitating strategic community partnerships with
non-healthcare sectors; and facilitating virtual group consultations on health inequities and social needs and

 The HIDR Core capitalizes on collaborations with the University of Missouri’s statewide network of health
care sites and extension centers, as well as the Missouri Telehealth Network, an innovative program that reaches
socioeconomically disadvantaged rural communities across the state in partnership with health care
organizations and key stakeholders. HIDR services have expanded in response to the use of health information
technologies (e.g., eHealth, mHealth, and telehealth) and the requests for services addressing the root causes of
diabetes inequities. HIDR is valued for its expertise in responding to rapid changes in healthcare arising from
increased use of health information technology, telehealth, and complex big data sets.
 The specific aims of the HIDR services for WU-CDTR investigators are to: (1) expand the application of
evidence-based health information technologies in diabetes translation research; (2) increase the capacity for the
use of telehealth in diabetes research among WU-CDTR investigators; and (3) advance means of managing,
scaling, and analyzing information from large, heterogeneous data sets to accelerate the progress of diabetes
translation research.
 HIDR provides Center investigators the expertise and resources needed to ensure excellence in the
conduct of health informatics diabetes translation research, and the opportunity to achieve diabetes health equity
in rural and disadvantaged populations. HIDR support of diabetes translation research is needed to accelerate

10897731,"Project 1 Summary
Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are providing durable clinical responses in about 20% of cancer patients,
but have minimal effect in cancers lacking intra-tumoral T cells. Approaches that turn T cell deplete cancers into
ones that attract high quality T cells are needed to sensitize these unresponsive cancers to ICIs. Most tumors
have somatic mutations that encode for mutant proteins that are tumor–specific and not expressed on normal
cells (termed neoantigens). Cancers with the highest mutational burdens are more likely to respond to single
agent ICIs. However, most cancers, including pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) have lower mutational loads,
resulting in lower antigenicity, weaker endogenous T cell repertoires, and fewer T cells infiltrating the tumor.
PDAs also have an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) consisting of suppressive monocytes,
B cells and T cells that express T cell inhibitory signals and exclude T cells or suppress them within the TME.
However, we published data showing in genetically–engineered KPC mice expressing the oncoprotein mutated
KRAS (mKRAS), that premalignant lesions can be prevented from progressing to PDA when a mKRAS vaccine
is given with ICIs. More recently, we published in the murine Panc02 model that expresses about 50 neoantigens
similar to human PDA, that a neoantigen targeted peptide vaccine (PancVAX) consisting of a mixture of 12
peptides each 20 amino acids long emulsed in adjuvant and given with ICIs, can treat PancO2 tumor-bearing
mice. Thus, in this proposal we will test the hypothesis that peptide vaccines targeting shared (mKRAS) or
personalized neoantigens will trigger high quality neoantigen–specific effector and effector memory T cells, which
will become available for further activation by ICIs and result in tumor rejection. We will conduct two human
clinical trials (Aims 1 and 2) to test vaccines targeting mKRAS and patient–tumor–specific neoantigens in
combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab in patients with resected and metastatic PDA, respectively. Moving
from the bedside back to the bench, in Aim 3, we will further develop our novel approaches arising from our
current data to enhance the immunogenicity of the neoantigen vaccines. Our new preliminary data has shown
that the inclusion of MHC Class II epitopes enhances CD8+ T cell response of our murine vaccine PancVAX
(which is composed primarily of MHC Class I epitopes). We will also interrogate the otherwise
immunosuppressive TME with targeted therapies that would potentially reprogram tumor-associated
macrophages and stromal cells in collaboration with Projects 3 and 4. In all instances, we will assess the quality
of T cells induced by each vaccine approach in combination with immune–modulatory agents. These studies will
inform future combination immunotherapy approaches for testing in Project 3 patients with PDA."

The goal of the Solutions to Diabetes in Black Americans National Resource Core (SDBA) is to provide content,
conceptual, and methodological expertise to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of translational type 2
diabetes (T2DM) and obesity research with Black populations. The SDBA will serve as a National Resource Core
to Washington University Center for Diabetes Translation Research (WU-CDTR) investigators located across the
country. The importance of a specific focus on T2DM in Black Americans is compelling, both in terms of the
disproportionate health burdens and the need for more effective interventions that reach Black communities at
large. Studies have demonstrated the potential efficacy of weight loss for T2DM prevention and control in diverse
populations, including in Black Americans. However, these research findings have not been effectively translated
or scaled to reach Black populations at the level needed to significantly reduce T2DM disparities. Moreover,
epidemiologic evidence and experience in practice point to aspects of social, economic, and policy contexts that
pose specific challenges for intervention effectiveness with Black populations.
 The SDBA Core is affiliated with the Council on Black Health, a national research and action network
located at Drexel University in Pennsylvania. The Council mission is “to develop and promote solutions that
achieve healthy Black communities,” with academic and community partnerships as a major strategy. The
Council’s member network includes established and emerging scholars and community-based research partners,
primarily Black Americans, located in 22 U.S. communities. The SDBA Core provides a focal point within the
Council for the dedicated focus on T2DM and obesity research.
 As a National Resource Core, the SDBA provides novel and critical services that support a wider scientific
community of WU-CDTR members on a national level. The specific aims for the SDBA Core are to: (1) provide
foundational knowledge about effects of historical oppression and structural racism on current contexts for viable
and sustainable interventions on T2DM, obesity, and related risk factors for Black Americans; (2) advance the
use of systematic approaches incorporating social determinants of health, cultural, and other contextual
influences in diabetes translation research with Black populations; and (3) increase the capacity of WU-CDTR
investigators to address critical gaps in diabetes translation research with Black populations.
 The SDBA will allow for further growth of the WU-CDTR network of scholars conducting research on the
root causes of T2DM in the Black population."

defined as ‘translating interventions and approaches that have demonstrated efficacy into real-world healthcare
settings, communities, and diverse populations with an emphasis on reach, sustainability, and potential for
widespread implementation’. The PFP provides initial research support over limited time periods to eligible
investigators exploring the feasibility of ideas or concepts related to the WU-CDTR mission to be the nexus for
transdisciplinary team science in advancing the conduct of next generation diabetes translation research.
 A priority of the PFP is to attract and retain early-stage investigators conducting diabetes translation
research, and to successfully support the development of all investigators who are members of the WU-CDTR.
Members of the WU-CDTR are affiliated through Washington University in St. Louis; the University of Missouri in
Columbia, MO; and the Council on Black Health at Drexel University. The PFP allows investigators to develop
preliminary data sufficient to provide the basis for subsequent applications for independent research support from
outside granting mechanisms. The successes of this program can be demonstrated in significant new external
funding, career advancement, and publications of PFP grant recipients.
 The specific aims of the PFP are to continue to provide support for: (1) new investigators in T2 to T4
diabetes translation research without current or past independent NIH research support; (2) established
investigators with previous work in diabetes translation research who want to explore innovative new directions in
research; and (3) established investigators from other scientific or disciplinary areas without previous work in
diabetes who are entering into new T2 to T4 diabetes translation research that represents a clear departure from
their ongoing research interests.
 Future directions for the PFP, based on our Center mission and careful evaluation of this progress, will
build on principles of mentorship and collaboration to assure continued success of the program."
10897738,"Project Summary/Abstract
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or its ligand have produced
unprecedented clinical benefit for some cancers but have failed in others including pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(PDA). PDAs display low T cell infiltration and high numbers of immunosuppressive cell types including myeloid-
derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Combination approaches that reverse the intrinsic immunosuppressive
biology of PDA will be key to converting PDA into an ICI-sensitive tumor type. Our group and others reported
that epigenetic therapies can influence both tumors and other cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME),
including immune and stromal cells. We reported that the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) entinostat
modulates myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), resulting in a less immunosuppressive population. We
have translated these preclinical findings into an ongoing clinical trial of entinostat in combination with the PD-1
inhibitor nivolumab, on which we have observed multiple clinical responses in metastatic PDA patients. The
current proposal builds upon our existing pre-clinical data to answer important mechanistic questions as to how
epigenetic modulatory therapies reprogram the TME for systemic immunotherapy. We hypothesize that HDACi
therapy can modulate multiple inflammatory, stromal and tumor cells in the PDA TME, converting PDA tumors
from immune excluding into immune responsive cancers. We will first evaluate HDACi modified pathways from
our preclinical findings to further identify specific pathways that are altered by HDACi. This work will specifically
test the hypothesis generated from our preliminary data that STAT3 modulation mediates entinostat’s effects on
MDSC function through regulation of multiple inflammatory pathways, resulting in the antitumor effect seen when
given in combination with anti-PD1 therapy. We will also expand our investigation of the immunomodulatory
effects of HDACi to evaluate the effect of entinostat on focused immune populations that receive signals from
MDSCs. We will use our preclinical models to test the hypothesis that entinostat uncovers mutation-associated
pancreatic cancer neoantigens that can augment antitumor immunity alone or in combination with systemic
immunotherapies. We will confirm our preclinical findings using our unique biospecimens collected from our
ongoing clinical trial of entinostat in combination with anti-PD1 therapy in PDA that is banking serial biopsies at
baseline, after entinostat monotherapy and after combination therapy, allowing assessment of the immune
impact of HDACi alone and in combination with ICI on the TME. In addition, we hope to build upon our clinical
experience with entinostat plus nivolumab by studying rational combinations of additional novel agents, providing
a preclinical basis for future therapeutic trials."

10897745,"Project Abstract – Project 3
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is characterized by a dense desmoplastic and immunosuppressive
stroma which remains a barrier to even combination immunotherapy approaches. Our group has developed and
tested a GM-CSF secreting allogeneic whole cell vaccine (GVAX) combined with a mesothelin-secreting listeria
monocytogenes-based vaccine (CRS-207) in a prime-boost strategy that can induce high quality T cells that
infiltrate PDAs. Promising activity was observed in early clinical studies; however, a randomized phase 2b study
comparing this strategy to chemotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic PDA failed to meet its
endpoint. Interestingly, biomarker analyses from this study and neoadjuvant testing of GVAX alone demonstrated
T cell infiltration into PDAs with subsequent upregulation of immune checkpoints such as programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) on PDA and
infiltrating myeloid cells. We also observed a correlation between immunosuppressive myeloid cells and stromal-
myeloid chemokines, e.g. CXCR4, CXCR2, CCR2, and outcomes. An ongoing clinical trial incorporating anti-
PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 with prime/boost vaccines in patients with previously treated metastatic PDA has yielded
a few durable responses. Thus, this project will test the central hypothesis that the stromal-myeloid
compartment remains a barrier to effective anti-tumor response and combination immunotherapy approaches
will require a T cell inducing vaccine + inhibitors of the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathway together with agents that
target myeloid-stromal cross-talk. To determine the myeloid-stromal signaling axes and their relationship to T
cell responses, we will first perform deep profiling of myeloid and T cells in the tumors and periphery of patients
participating in three complementary clinical trials employing GVAX/CRS-207 and immune checkpoint inhibitor
(ICI) therapies. Additionally, we will employ a novel platform trial design to rapidly test different myeloid-stromal
targeting agents with ICI +/- vaccines in parallel or sequentially. The first sub-protocol is ready to accrue and
will test anti-PD-1 and anti-CXCR4 pathways building on prior data. We will collect biopsies at baseline and on
treatment and determine the precise effects of these agents on myeloid and stromal populations, and on T cell
activation in tumor and in the periphery. Data generated will be shared to inform the other 3 Projects. In addition,
optimized agents from each project will be incorporated into new sub-protocols for testing in our Platform trial.
The final deliverable is an optimized combination of T cell inducing agents given with ICIs and stromal-myeloid
reprogramming agents that show clinical responses and can be validated in a multicenter clinical trial."
10897756,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is enriched with activated stellate cells and hyaluronic acids (HA) that
contribute to the cancer’s poor prognosis. Our recent publication has shown that the PEGylated form of
recombinant hyaluronidase (PEGPH20), which degrades hyaluronic acid in the stroma, enhances the intra-
tumoral trafficking of effector T cells and anti-tumor efficacy of a PDA vaccine. We also demonstrated that the
effect of PEGPH20 is mediated by the CXCL12-CXCR4-CCR7 signaling axis that is transmitted from stromal
fibroblasts to myeloid cells and T cells. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) also plays an integral role in modulating
pancreatic stellate cells and recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) into PDA mouse tumors. FAK inhibition can also enhance
antitumor activity when given in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that block PD-1. Therefore,
we hypothesize that targeting stromal/myeloid cell signals by FAK and HA-CXCR4 inhibition will enhance
antitumor immune responses by selectively recruiting high-quality effector memory T cells (Tem) into PDA
tumors. First, this project will examine PDA tumor microenvironment (TME) reprogramming following treatment
with stromal/myeloid cell targeting agents and ICIs in PDA mouse models. We will test combinations of
PEGPH20 or anti-CXCR4 antibody, with FAK inhibitor and anti-PD-1 antibody, for enhanced T cell infiltration
and function in murine PDAs. We will compare two different CXCL12/CXCR4 targeting agents: anti-mouse
CXCR4 antibody vs. small molecule inhibitor AMD3100, and evaluate whether lower HA/CXCR4 is associated
with improved response to PD-1 and FAK inhibitors in PDA tumors banked from a clinical trial testing anti-PD-1
and FAK inhibition as neoadjuvant therapy for surgically resectable PDA patients. Second, this project will dissect
mechanisms of cross-talk between FAK and HA-CXCR4 signaling pathways that regulate infiltration and function
of high-quality T cells in murine PDA. We will test the working hypotheses that PEGPH20 inhibits CD44 through
degrading HA; by inhibiting binding of HA to its receptor CD44, PEGPH20 inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK
reducing its inhibitory activity in Tem. Also, HA activates pFAK in CAFs to produce CXCL12, which in turn
activates CXCR4 on suppressive myeloid cells. Third, this project will explore combinations of FAK inhibition
and stroma/myeloid cell targeting agents, with ICIs for enhanced infiltration and function of high-quality
neoepitope-specific effector T cells in murine PDAs. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that combining neo-
antigen T cell inducing approaches with FAK and HA/CXCR4 inhibitors and ICIs results in enhanced infiltration
and function of high quality, neoepitope-specific T cells in PDAs."
10909194,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Organ transplantation is a standard-of-care treatment for patients with end-organ failure. Although graft survival
has increased significantly over the years, many patients lose their life-saving transplant due to antibody-
mediated rejection. Recent work demonstrated that the main target of these antibodies are donor HLA-DQ
molecules. This observation is puzzling since the leading convention in the field considered HLA-DR, another
type of HLA-class II molecules, as the leading “transplantation antigens”. It is now clear that the frequency and
pathogenicity of antibodies against HLA-DQ is higher than HLA-DR (and HLA-DP, the third class II HLA
molecules). Currently, there is no mechanistic explanation to these observations. Our central hypothesis is that
HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP were specialized, through evolutionary pressure, to control somewhat different
pathways of immune activation. This can be likened to the 3 types of cone photoreceptor cell types that provide
similar functionality but for different wavelengths to maximize sensitivity to color.
Importantly, the vast majority of mechanistic studies focused on HLA-DR, and the assumption is that HLA-DQ
and HLA-DP use identical immune pathways. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanism leading to the
increased immunogenicity and pathogenicity of HLA-DQ mismatches in allo-transplantation (compared with
HLA-DR and HLA-DP). The objective is to decipher permissible from non-permissible HLA-DQ mismatches, and
further to elucidate immune activation pathways that are preferentially stimulated by HLA-DQ allo-recognition.
Specifically, in Aim 1, we will define the immunogenicity of HLA-DQ mismatches that lead to the development
of donor-specific HLA-DQ antibodies in transplant recipients. We will use computational and experimental
approaches including adsorption/elution and site directed mutagenesis studies to prognosticate qualitative
characteristics of HLA-DQ epitopes. In Aim 2, we will compare immune activation pathways triggered by ligation
of different HLA class II molecules. We will evaluate the 3 different mechanisms of the immune response: those
mediated by qualities of the antibody itself; those transduced inwards, downstream of the ligated HLA class II
molecules; and those elicited via the T cell receptor recognizing the different class II molecules. We will use
cutting edge proteomic technology as well as CRISPR-Cas9 edited cells expressing only one HLA class II allele
as innovative tools to interrogate these specific pathways. Taken together, this project will support two significant
advancements in solid organ transplantation: personalized medicine with respect to organ allocation and
immunosuppressive management, and identification of novel immune targets for drug development.
The shortage of organs for transplantation, the medical and financial ramifications associated with the need to
treat allograft rejection, and the impact of immunosuppression and graft dysfunction/loss on patient quality of life
all highlight an unmet need for improving organ transplant outcomes. The proposed work is in line with the NIAID
mission of conducting applied research to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent transplant rejection."
10834291,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Offspring of mothers with major depressive disorder (MDD) are at substantially elevated risk for developing
depression by early adulthood. Devastatingly, 60% of these high risk (HR) youth will meet criteria for MDD by
age 25, versus only 16% of individuals in the general population. Recognized by the 2022 NIMH Strategic Plan,
the discovery of a reliable, objective marker of MDD risk is critical for earlier detection to facilitate targeted
prevention efforts for HR youth. Across studies, HR offspring exhibit maladaptive reactivity and regulatory
responses to negative social-emotional stimuli. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks
probing negative emotion processing (NEP), youth of depressed, versus nondepressed, mothers consistently
exhibit dysfunction in brain networks responsible for adaptive NEP, including
salience emotional and cognitive
control networks (SEN and CCN). Critically, pilot data from the Early-Stage Principal Investigator provide
compelling evidence that SEN-CCN network dysfunction during NEP may represent a brain-based marker of
depression among HR youth. However, a mechanistic test of this hypothesis has yet to be evaluated in an
adequately powered and demographically distributed sample of HR and low risk (LR) youth followed over a
sufficient period to detect the emergence of MDD. The current R01 will employ a novel, multimodal, longitudinal
study to test whether functional properties of brain networks supporting NEP predict future depression
trajectories among HR and LR youth (Aim 1). In doing so, we will examine whether SEN-CCN dysfunction during
NEP changes over time once depression emerges. Clarifying the question of stability is critical to determining
whether SEN-CCN dysfunction during NEP is modifiable and may represent a novel MDD treatment target in
HR youth (Aim 2). Prior work also shows that HR youth exhibit deficits in NEP across physiological (event-related
potentials, ERPs), behavioral, and self-report indices. To determine which risk markers should be prioritized for
prevention, an innovative aspect of the proposal will be to test if SEN-CCN function during NEP is superior to
other cost-effective markers of risk in predicting youth depression, and whether a multi-indicator model including
several units of NEP improves MDD prediction indices (Aim 3). Finally, we will explore how biological sex and
puberty interact with neurodevelopmental pathways to predict depression trajectories in HR youth. To achieve
these aims, we will recruit 250 youth (with and without with a maternal history of recurrent MDD). At baseline,
youth (ages 9-14, 50% female) will be lifetime free of MDD to capture the emergence of depression during a
period of elevated MDD risk. At baseline, 12-, and 24- months, youth will complete tasks probing negative social-
emotional reactivity and regulation to generate multimodal NEP measures (fMRI, ERPs, behavior). Every 6
months, we will assess youth’s depressive symptoms and diagnoses via online surveys and phone interviews
(up to 24 months). Findings will contribute to the discovery of biomarkers that are linked to the development and
course of MDD among HR youth, which can be utilized in targeted MDD prevention and intervention studies."

Longitudinal, within-subject approaches, have the potential to increase sensitivity and specificity, improving
the efficiency of clinical trials by requiring fewer subjects and providing potential surrogate endpoints to
assess therapeutic efficacy. There is also great potential that these tools will enable more sophisticated
anatomical modeling to better understand the temporal dynamics of progression. In Alzheimer’s Disease in
particular, early detection, prior to widespread and likely irreversible cell death, is crucial for the development
of effective therapeutic interventions. However, longitudinal tools have not yet been optimized for use in
clinical studies. Challenges include the reduction of noise across serial scans while providing each time point
equal relative weighting to avoid bias; adequately and appropriately accounting for atrophy; and handling
varying MRI contrast and distortion across time. In this proposal, we seek to improve longitudinal analysis in a
number of ways, leveraging the power of modern deep learning to increase accuracy, make it applicable to
any type of MRI contrast, radically reduce execution time, as well as make it usable in direct clinical
applications.
To achieve these aims we will employ newly developed image synthesis techniques to train networks to detect
small, “true” anatomical change hidden within a set of large-scale “MRI” distortions, that will capture
longitudinal differences in image acquisition such as gradient nonlinearities, field strength and B0 distortions,
and sequence parameter variations. The change-detection network will be cascaded with a deep registration
network that will learn to decompose the temporal warp into uninteresting MRI distortions and interesting
anatomical effects, then both warp fields and the aligned images will be provided to a segmentation network
to ensure no information is lost by the registration. The networks will learn to ignore MRI effects based on
their stereotypical behavior (e.g. the one-dimensionality of B0 distortions, the spatial smoothness of gradient
nonlinearities) and to detect the subtle anatomical changes such as increasing ventricular size or decreasing
hippocampal volume. The result will be a set of robust contrast-and-distortion-agnostic tools that highlight
potential disease effects for clinicians."
10913384,"There is a compelling need to decipher the role of the dysregulation of translation elongation in various chronic neurological conditions and many cancers. The long-term goal driving the proposed research is to help develop therapeutic strategies targeting eEF2K for treating progressive neurodegenerative diseases and malignancies. The overall objectives of this application are to (i) characterize the kinetic mechanism of eEF2K activation and regulation and (ii) elucidate the structural basis for the regulation of eEF2K by divalent cations, pH, ADP, and
specific post-translational modifications. The central hypothesis is that calmodulin (CaM) binding activates eEF2K by profoundly altering its conformational dynamics, leading to a state capable of efficient phosphoryl transfer. Multiple regulatory inputs control the attainment of this state. The rationale is that understanding the mechanism of eEF2K regulation is necessary to provide a robust scientific framework for developing novel therapeutic approaches targeting neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The central hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: (1) to define the kinetic mechanism of activation of eEF2K by calmodulin and the
kinetic basis for the modulation of its activity, (2) to determine the structural and dynamic basis of how specific inputs and post-translational modifications regulate the stability of active states of eEF2K. In the first aim, presteady state kinetics will define the precise allosteric mechanism of eEF2K activation and modulation of its activity. The second aim will determine the modulatory effects of specific post-translational modifications and other regulatory inputs in affecting the CaM sensitivity of the active state using a variety of structural approaches. The findings from both aims will be validated by characterizing eEF2K activation and activity in mammalian cells.
In our opinion, the research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on understanding the relationships between the structural dynamics and the temporal control of eEF2K in mammalian cells using a unique combination of techniques integrated over multiple length scales from the atomic to the cellular. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide new insight into the cellular regulation of protein translation by eEF2K and provide critical advancement in understanding various eEF2K-driven pathologies."

compartment, leading to death of bone and marrow cells. It is associated with progressive pain, bony collapse,
and joint degeneration within months to several years. Over 10 million people are afflicted worldwide. Most
patients are diagnosed in their mid-30s, during their peak working years. The pathogenesis and treatment of
this disease are controversial. If diagnosed early, the goal is to preserve the native hip joint. Total hip
replacement is reserved for painful end-stage disease. Core decompression (CD) is the most common
treatment in the early stages of ONFH and creates a drill tract into the lesion. However, the clinical outcome of
CD is variable. There is increasing interest in using bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) to augment CD.
Yet, studies have been limited to small case series, different disease stages, multiple risk factors, variable
surgical techniques, or otherwise have lacked rigor.
 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is needed to obtain a more definitive answer regarding the efficacy of
BMAC with CD for early-stage ONFH. The overall goal of our multicenter clinical trial (U01) is to test the
following hypotheses: “Patients who have early-stage ONFH undergoing CD augmented with autogenous
BMAC will have better clinical and radiological outcomes than CD alone.” This RCT will also define specific
patient characteristics that determine the long-term outcomes of these procedures.
 The Co-PIs are world-renowned experts, who are academic and clinical leaders in osteonecrosis. A team of
highly recognized clinicians, who have expertise in the treatment of osteonecrosis from 12 centers in the
United States have been recruited. For standardization, we will utilize a centralized radiologist, a central bone
biology laboratory, and a center for data management and biostatistical analysis.
Our specific aims are:
Specific Aim 1 (SA1). To determine if CD with autogenous BMAC results in better outcomes than CD alone
for the treatment of early-stage (pre-collapse) ARCO Stage I and II ONFH.
Specific Aim 2 (SA2). SA 2A. To determine the cellular phenotype of the patients’ bone marrow aspirates, as
assessed by Mass Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyTOF). SA 2B. To build a multivariate model classifying
patients who have satisfactory and unsatisfactory clinical and/or radiological outcomes based on the combined
mass cytometry cell frequency and functional feature dataset.
In summary, we have planned this multicenter trial with our NIAMS-sponsored project team (R34 AR073505)
and assembled a team of experts in the diagnosis and treatment of ONFH. The trial will benefit from existing
studies and infrastructure by our group. We will determine if ON patients benefit from autogenous BMAC to
augment CD, and investigate the biological mechanisms underlying improvements in outcome."

The remarkable efficiency of human perception derives from the fact that we do not process each stimulus as a
novel event. Instead, past experiences and scene context inform internal, working models of the world that
allow us to generate predictions for our physical environment. A leading theory suggests that perceptual
predictions are accomplished via flexible normalization: local inhibitory neuronal populations are regulated by
long-range connections so that responses are suppressed when they do not provide helpful information about
object boundaries. However, the precise neural mechanisms by which the healthy human brain accomplishes
this flexible normalization are not known. In order to understand exactly how neural population responses are
suppressed or enhanced in response to different scene contexts, we will perform 2-photon imaging in ferret
primary visual cortex (V1) to quantify the responses of excitatory and inhibitory neural populations in superficial
layers of cortex during several different visual stimulus paradigms. The ferret model is chosen because the
imaging techniques necessary to quantify inhibitory neuronal responses are not yet well established in primate
models, and while our current knowledge about neural morphology and connections has been derived from
mouse models, mouse visual cortex lacks the “columnar organization” (spatial grouping of neurons with similar
response properties) that is a hallmark of primate visual cortex and is present in ferrets. Thus, the ferret model
is well-positioned to bridge the gap between mouse models and primate models. First, in order to understand
neuronal behaviors in the absence of contextual modulation, we will characterize interactions within a single
hypercolumn to small, simple stimuli (sinusoidally modulated luminance gratings) at a range of orientations and
contrasts. We hypothesize that parvalbumin-containing (PV+) inhibitory interneurons will demonstrate the
sharpest orientation tuning, followed by somatostatin-containing (SOM+) and serotonin-positive (5HTR+)
populations. Next. using a Cross Orientation Suppression paradigm, we will test the hypothesis that that SOM+
responses track the overall contrast energy in the stimulus, while PV+ populations reflect suppression of
individual grating component representations. Additional experiments with naturalistic textures will test whether
these behaviors generalize to stimuli with a broad range of contrasts, orientations, and spatial frequencies.
Finally, we will use classical Orientation-Dependent Surround Suppression and Collinear Facilitation paradigms
to study how the local inhibitory pool responds to scene context. We hypothesize that the responses of local
5HTR+ neurons will reflect the surrounding stimuli rather than the center stimuli. Together, these experiments
will constrain an open-source computational model articulated at the level of the single neuron that will
constrain hypotheses about how human perceptual behaviors are linked to specific neuronal populations; this
model will be valuable for understanding how perceptual aberrations associated with psychosis might be
mapped to the function of specific neuronal subpopulations."

Genomic medicine has rapidly advanced in the past decade enabling earlier diagnosis and personalized
treatment. However, only a few highly specialized centers in the US have the resources to take advantage of
these advances in patient care. This has created a large health equity gap whereby patients cared for in typical
community settings, often low-income and/or representing racial/ethnic minorities, do not receive equitable
medical care. Another barrier to the wider utilization of genomic medicine is the poor dissemination of
knowledge among clinicians, especially in community settings. A wide gap exists in the implementation of
genomic medicine from diagnosis to personalized therapies, a field experiencing huge advances but still
subject to wide disparities in accessibility. Our proposal aims to develop and test the implementation of a
strategy to break down these barriers to genomic medicine, aligned with RFA-HG-20-036. Our target
population is sick newborns. We propose a novel center, VIrtual GenOme CenteR (VIGOR), building upon our
past and ongoing research as investigators for the NIH-funded Babyseq study (U19HD077671), Undiagnosed
Disease Network (U01HG007690), and Center for Mendelian Genomics (UM1HG008900). VIGOR will be a
center that can remotely support clinicians and families working in community NICUs. In AIM 1, we will
establish the VIGOR center, and enroll and follow 250 eligible newborns and their families for 6 months within
4 community NICUs in the Northeast that serve diverse populations. In AIM 2, we will facilitate exome
sequencing and create and return timely, comprehensive interpretive reports to families and physicians that:
(1) relay diagnostic findings, (2) recommend clinical actions, (3) offer reanalysis of data for those with negative
or inconclusive findings; and (4) provide additional research opportunities. In AIM 3, we will comprehensively
assess implementation outcomes. Among neonatologists and within NICUs, we will examine 1)
Appropriateness; 2) Feasibility; 3) Penetration; and 4) Equity (by race/ethnicity, insurance status, and primary
language) and 5) Satisfaction of VIGOR use; among families, we will examine 1) Satisfaction; 2) Adverse
mental health (stress and depression) and 3) Newborn clinical outcomes. This study will provide rigorous
evaluation of implementing a virtual genome center into community clinical settings without highly specialized
resources, thereby offering generalizable insights as to how best to implement genomic medicine at scale and
for other age groups. Our intervention has great potential to address disparities in genomic medicine among
low-income and URM populations and will enhance capacity for providers and health systems to utilize highly
specialized genomic techniques in their communities."

Candidate and Career Goals: I intend to become an independent scientist at a research-first academic institution,
bridging across levels of description (i.e., from computations to neurons) and furthering our understanding of
how the brain infers the world around us, as well as ourselves within it. I trained as a cognitive scientist (winning
the Glushko Prize for best dissertation in Cognitive Science, worldwide), with a focus on understanding our sense
of self-location; where am “I” located in space. I am now training in systems neuroscience, developing expertise
in large-scale rodent neurophysiology and with a focus on the dynamic aspects of self-location; spatial
navigation. These experiences complement each other; from behavioral computations to single-units, and from
static to dynamic self-location. Environment and Career Development Plan: I am mentored by Dr. Dora Angelaki
(NYU, expertise in navigation) and co-mentored by Drs. David Schneider (NYU, rodent self-generated actions)
and Cristina Savin (NYU, data science). Further, I am a scientist member of the International Brain Lab, allowing
me the opportunity to leverage world-class expertise (22 labs) in rodent neurophysiology. My training during the
K99 will focus on model-based analyses of behavior and neurons during continuous and complex naturalistic
tasks, as well as lab management skills (i.e., personnel, grant-writing, communication). Research Plan: Spatial
navigation is central to adaptive behavior, underlying our ability to trade-off the exploitation of our current location
with the exploration of novel ones. Beautiful work has detailed a number of spatial codes (e.g., place and grid
cells) in the hippocampal formation, yet we (1) lack a normative framework accounting for the complexities of
natural navigation, (2) do not understand how spatial codes from the hippocampal formation interact with cortex,
and (3) have focused on understanding how we build internal models of the world around us, while neglecting
its starting point – ourselves. During the K99 phase of the award, I will develop a naturalistic navigation task in
virtual reality where rodents will be required to disambiguate complex signals. These animals will be trained to
integrate velocity signals derived from motion across their retina (i.e., optic flow) into a position estimate, in order
to path integrate to the location of a latent target. Then, they will be tested in a novel situation, one where optic
flow may be caused by self- and/or target-motion. I expect animals to behave in line with Bayesian Causal
Inference (BCI) – a canonical computation wherein estimation biases emerge during small, but not large, signal
disparities (i.e., when observers operate under the incorrect internal model). Further, I will broadly map neural
activity throughout the rodent’s brain during BCI by leveraging novel large-scale neurophysiology techniques.
During the R00 phase of the award, I will directly manipulate the subjective sense of self-location – the initial
condition for navigation - and measure this phenomenology in rodents via the task developed during the K99.
Beyond establishing BCI as a fundamental computation guiding naturalistic navigation, I expect the proposed
project to inform next-generation therapeutics for disorders of inference, such as Autism and Schizophrenia."

In the last 5–10-years new model systems, to study ALS, FTD and other dementias, based on patient derived
induced pluripotent cell lines have provide great insight into highly relevant disease-causing pathways as well
as fundamental neuronal and glial cell biology. New studies using these, and other model systems suggest
the nuclear transport is the fundamental injury linked to both familial sporadic ALS and FTD. Emerging
studies now implicate nuclear transport and the nuclear pore complex in multiple different neurodegenerative
diseases including ALS, FTD, Huntington’s disease and even aging. These studies are beginning to identify
candidate therapies for sporadic forms of the disease. The nuclear pore complex is diverse, and mutations of
its constituent proteins can lead to a wide range of different degenerative diseases. Thus, studies of the CNS
nuclear pore and nucleocytoplasmic transport have pathogenic implications that are wide ranging. This
proposal will comprehensively investigate the biology of CNS nuclear pores and nuclear transport- the
fundamental properties in different neuronal and glia, mechanisms by which the nuclear pore is disrupted,
include possibly disease initiating biology involving the ESCT3/CHMP7 pathways, how the nuclear pore
complex is disrupted in sporadic and familial forms of the diseases utilizing several complementary models
including C9-ALS fly and mouse models and iPS neurons and brain tissue from sporadic and C9orf72 mutant
ALS/FTD patients. We will also investigate whether modulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport and /or repair
of the nuclear pore complex may be a therapeutic strategy for ALS/FTD. Our emerging data teach that there
are multiple candidate therapeutic opportunities for this pathway and neurodegeneration. As we have now
learned that defect on the nuclear pore complex are upstream of the disruption of TDP43 nuclear location and
loss of function, this pathway may have relevance to not only ALS and FTD – but other neurological injuries
involving TDP43 misregulation. Finally, studies over the last decade have revealed that neurodegenerative
diseases are not simply a disorder of neurons, but that glial cells also contribute to pathophysiology. Many
studies have implicated aberrant astroglial function in ALS and neurodegeneration. Regional alterations of
astroglia have long been known—but how this occurs and whether astroglia exist as functional/molecular
subtypes has been unclear. New studies from our group and others now suggests real subtypes of astroglia
exist, may have specific functions n modulating cortical dendritic and synaptic biology and may be selectively
altered in ALS. The biology of these newly identified subgroups will be explored in this proposal and how they
alter spines/dendrites, neuronal elements known to be dramatically altered in neurodegeneration."
10923801,"Revised Abstract

Recent evidence shows that creating new fat cells (adipogenesis) can counteract the harmful metabolic effects of obesity, which have been shown to originate primarily from abnormal enlargement (hypertrophy) and resulting dysfunction of existing fat cells. Thus, how to increase adipogenesis over hypertrophy is of great interest. Previous work showed that preadipocytes in vivo and in vitro must complete one or more cell cycles, a process referred to as clonal expansion, before they can differentiate into adipocytes. One of the most striking genetic examples of increased adipogenesis was demonstrated by manipulating this clonal expansion period by knocking out the cell cycle inhibitors p21 and p27. Knockout of either p21 or p27 in mice results in a 2-fold increase in adipogenesis and fat mass, but knockout of both results in a dramatic 6-fold increase. Previous work suggests that p21 and p27 are regulated by very different mechanisms and are active at different times during adipogenesis. In recent published work, we identified the molecular mechanisms that could explain the increased adipogenesis observed in the p21- knockout mouse. However, how p27 regulates adipogenesis and tissue mass and how p21 and p27 synergize are poorly understood. We hypothesize that the synergistic expression of p21 and p27 during adipogenesis is the primary mechanism that controls the number of cell divisions before differentiation, and thus controls the number the adipocytes produced per preadipocyte. We will test this hypothesis by using live-cell imaging approaches, together with a fat-pad injection mouse model. We will first use methods to inducibly express and rapidly degrade p27 to determine when and how p27 regulates cell cycle progression during adipogenesis. We will then use live cell reporters for CDK4/6 and CDK2 activity to understand when and how p27 and p21 synergize to regulate CDK4/6 and CDK2 activity and control the number of adipocytes produced. The outcome of this work will be a framework how the clonal expansion period can be controlled to significantly increase adipogenesis over hypertrophy while also ensuring that the progenitor pool is maintained. Our results will likely have broad applicability not only to the maintenance of adipose tissue, but also more generally for the maintenance and regeneration of neuronal, muscle, and other terminally differentiated tissues."
10889004,"Project Summary
Arterial medial calcification (AMC) and arterial stiffening are a prevalent pathological process in different
pathological conditions or diseases such as hypertension, aging, atherosclerosis, diabetes and chronic kidney
disease. Enhanced exosome secretion by smooth muscle cells (SMCs) has been reported to be an essential
mechanism for calcifying nidus formation and extracellular matrix mineralization in the arterial wall to result in
AMC. Recent studies have also shown that lysosome function plays a critical role in controlling multivesicular
body (MVB) fate and enhancing exosome secretion and thereby in the development of arterial calcification.
However, it remains poorly understood how lysosome function is controlled to determine exosome secretion
and thereby lead to AMC. This proposal seeks to explore a novel epigenetic mechanism that regulates
lysosome trafficking and exosome secretion, which may contribute to the development of AMC. This
epigenetic regulation of lysosome function may be associated with the lysine methyltransferase Kmt6-
mediated repression of gene transcription of Smpd1, a lysosome enzyme that hydrolyzes sphingomyelin into
ceramide. Kmt6 is considered as a crucial epigenetic regulator that represses the target gene expression by
methylation of lysine residue in histone proteins. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated that SMC-specific
Kmt6 gene deletion exacerbated AMC and arterial stiffening, which were associated with increased Smpd1
expression and ceramide production, reduced lysosome TRPML1 channel activity, and lysosome trafficking
dysfunction. These observations led us to hypothesize that Kmt6 is an essential epigenetic regulatory enzyme
that controls lysosomal Smpd1-mediated sphingolipid metabolism and thereby regulates lysosome trafficking
or its fusion to MVBs and subsequent exosome secretion in SMCs. Kmt6 gene defect or functional deficiency
may disturb lysosome-mediated degradation of MVBs leading to increased exosome secretion, calcifying
nidus formation, osteogenic transition, and ultimately AMC in face of different pathological challenges. To test
this hypothesis, the following Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine loss of Kmt6 contributes to
osteogenic transition and AMC in SMC-specific Kmt6 knockout mice with analysis of SMC phenotypes and
calcification. Aim 2 attempts to test whether Kmt6-mediated epigenetic regulation of Smpd1 critically controls
lysosome trafficking and exosome secretion by increasing TRPML1 channel activity and associated Ca2+
release using patch clamping of isolated lysosomes and lysosome-specific Ca2+ imaging. Aim 3 will explore
the molecular mechanisms how Smpd1 gene is epigenetically regulated by Kmt6 with a focus on its action on
histone and DNA methylation in cultured arterial SMCs. Our findings will for the first time define an epigenetic
mechanism controlling Smpd1 expression and activity via Kmt6 in SMCs and reveal a novel role of epigenetic
dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism in the development of AMC and arterial stiffening. These findings
may also identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of AMC under different pathological conditions."
10839381,"Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure is a significant clinical problem in the hemodialysis patient
population. Targeted nanomedicine is a rapidly growing area of research that is a promising approach to treat a
wide spectrum of diseases, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. However, there is a paucity of research
regarding the use of targeted nanomedicine to treat or prevent AVF maturation failure. Moreover, a better
understanding of the pathways involved in AVF maturation failure is essential to develop novel therapeutic
strategies, including targeted nanomedicine.
 The first objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of the transcription factor ETS proto-oncogene
1 (ETS-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 in AVF development. Extensive work from our team
has provided a strong rationale that the ETS-1 and MMP-2/9 axis is a major driver of pathological AVF
remodeling. The second objective of this proposal is to investigate the effectiveness of drug-loaded P-selectin-
targeted nanoparticles (NPs) to treat or prevent AVF maturation failure. AVF maturation failure is a regional
problem, and therefore, targeted delivery of drugs to the AVF site may reduce dose-limiting toxicity, undesirable
off-target effects, and unfavorable pharmacokinetics due to rapid drug degradation. We have recently engineered
innovative NPs that display high affinity to P-selectin expressed in injured/activated endothelial cells. We found
that AVF creation surgery was followed by increased P-selectin expression at the AVF site and that P-selectin-
targeted NPs were preferentially aggregated at the AVF site. Furthermore, our team has developed various NPs
for drugs with different sizes and chemical properties. The NPs for small drugs are based on fucoidan (a
polysaccharide), which exhibits nanomolar affinity to P-selectin. The NPs for large drugs are based on liposomes
conjugated with P-selectin ligands. Both carriers are made of natural and synthetic biocompatible materials that
have been shown to be safe for use in humans.
 Our long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutic strategies to prevent AVF maturation failure that can
ultimately be safely used in humans. Our central hypothesis is that maturation failure is caused by upregulated
ETS-1 and MMP-2/9, and that the blockade of this pathway using nanoparticle-targeted delivery of drugs can
improve AVF maturation. This hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims, using a combination of genetic
approach (Aim 1) and nanotechnology (Aim 2). Aim 1: To determine the causal role of ETS-1 and MMP-2/9 in
pathological AVF development in rodents with CKD. Aim 2: To investigate the therapeutic potency of ETS-1 and
MMP-2/9 inhibition by targeted nanomedicine in enhancing AVF development in rodents with CKD. This
translational project is innovative and significant, as it investigates a novel molecular pathway of AVF maturation
failure and uses a novel nanotechnology for treating/preventing this clinical problem. Successful completion of
these aims will identify important targets for developing innovative nanomedicine to enhance AVF maturation."

Chronic and/or excess glucocorticoid (GC) exposure, such as prolonged stress and long-term GC therapy,
causes metabolic disorders including hyperglycemia. Intracellular GC receptor (GR) has been shown to directly
stimulate the transcription of gluconeogenic genes, such as Pck1 and G6pc, to promote gluconeogenesis.
However, chronic GC exposure can induce additional mechanisms to further enhance hepatic gluconeogenesis.
Our preliminary studies found that chronic GC exposure elevated hepatic sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels.
S1P is exported to the extracellular surface and binds to membrane S1P receptors (S1PRs) to exert its actions.
We found that reducing S1PR2 expression in mouse liver attenuated chronic GC exposure-promoted
gluconeogenesis. Activating S1PR2 in hepatoma cells enhanced GC-induced Pck1 and G6pc expression.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay found that GC-induced GR recruitment to the GC response elements
(GREs) of Pck1 and G6pc was reduced by hepatic S1PR2 knockdown. Global gene expression analysis
identified that RAR-related orphan receptor C (Rorc) expression was reduced by hepatic S1PR2 knockdown.
Rorc antagonist attenuated GC-induced gluconeogenic gene expression in hepatoma cells and overexpressing
Rorc in the liver of hepatic S1PR2 knockout mice enhanced GC-induced GR recruitment to the Pck1 and G6pc
GREs as well as their expression. Intriguingly, GC suppressed Rorc expression, which was antagonized by
S1PR2 signaling. Based on these results, we hypothesize that chronic GC exposure activates S1PR2 signaling
to enhance GC-induced gluconeogenesis by inhibiting GC’s suppressive effect on the expression of Rorc, which
can act with GR to strongly augment gluconeogenic gene transcription. In Aim 1, we will test if altering
intracellular S1P levels in hepatocytes affects chronic GC treatment-induced hyperglycemia by overexpressing
or knocking down Sphk1 and Sphk2 (both convert sphingosine to S1P), Sgpl1 (hydrolyzes S1P) and Spns2
(exports S1P to extracellular space) in mouse liver. In Aim 2, we will establish Rorc’s in GC-induced hepatic
gluconeogenesis by reducing hepatic Rorc expression or treating mice with Rorc antagonist. Notably, 4a-
carboxy, 4b-methyl-zymosterol (4ACD8), a metabolite of cholesterol biosynthesis, has been shown to be a Rorc
agonist. We will investigate whether reducing the expression of Sc4mol, an enzyme generating 4ACD8,
attenuates the GC effect on hepatic gluconeogenesis. In Aim 3, we will identify signaling molecules activated by
S1PR2 that participate in GC regulation of gluconeogenic genes and Rorc expression. We will also analyze the
role of Rorc in GR regulated global hepatic gene transcription. Finally, how GC and S1PR2 signaling regulate
Rorc expression will be investigated. Overall, the proposed studies will establish a novel S1PR2-Rorc axis
induced specifically upon chronic GC exposure to enhance GC activated gluconeogenesis. Not only will this
knowledge advance our understand on pathophysiology of chronic GC exposure, but it also will provide novel
targets for therapeutic intervention against steroid induced hyperglycemia."

The 5-year survival after lung transplantation is a dismal 53% and chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) has
emerged as the primary obstacle to better long-term outcomes. Clearly, current standard-of-care
immunosuppressive regimens are failing lung transplant recipients, and there is a critical unmet need to improve
survival. Primary graft dysfunction (PGD), episodes of acute cellular rejection (ACR), antibody-mediated rejection
(AMR), and the development of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) are widely recognized risk factors for the
development of CLAD. Furthermore, mechanistic studies link these inflammatory and alloimmune injuries to the
fibrotic lesions that characterize CLAD. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that drives these deleterious inflammatory,
immune, and fibrogenic responses thus, an especially attractive cytokine to target. Indeed, in experimental
models, IL-6 signaling blockade has been shown to skew the Th17/Treg balance in favor of regulatory cell
commitment thereby expanding Treg numbers, reducing allograft rejection, and diminishing memory B cell
numbers and antibody formation (primary and recall). In human trials, IL-6R inhibition reduced alloantibody levels
in highly sensitized kidney allograft recipients and improved graft and patient survival in kidney recipients with
the most severe form of chronic antibody-mediated rejection. These data form the basis of our hypothesis that
early IL-6 inhibition after lung transplantation will induce a protective/anti-inflammatory milieu that will have long-
lasting effects on the host's immune system and allograft resulting in improved long-term graft and patient
survival. To test this hypothesis, we propose to conduct a phase 2, multicenter, double blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled trial examining the impact of early IL-6 inhibition with clazakizumab on CLAD-free allograft
survival after lung transplantation. Clazakizumab (CSL Behring) is a genetically engineered, high affinity,
humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) which binds to IL-6 and is a full and competitive antagonist of IL-6-
induced cell function. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial is a composite of 1) CLAD, 2) re-transplantation,
or 3) death. Key secondary endpoints include PGD, ACR, AMR, DSA. Furthermore, we plan to leverage the rich
clinical data and human biospecimens that this clinical trial will generate to define the utility of several noninvasive
biomarkers as risk assessment, diagnostic, and predictive testing strategies. Finally, we will conduct mechanistic
studies to explain the effects of clazakizumab observed in the clinical trial. This trial represents the first
application of IL-6 blockade in lung transplantation and has the potential change clinical practice and improve
outcomes for lung transplant recipients. If CZK therapy is successful, our comprehensive and integrated
mechanistic studies will allow us to elucidate mechanisms of improved graft outcomes. If therapy fails, we will
be able to understand why. Either way, insights into the mechanisms of alloimune injury and
chronic lung allograft dysfunction could lead to new preventative or treatment regimens."
10873180,"In the United States, more than 200,000 patients are estimated to suffer from enteric hyperoxaluria (EH). EH affects patients with malabsorptive gastrointestinal diseases and is well-known to cause recurrent nephrolithiasis. Therapies for EH are limited and only partially mitigate hyperoxaluria. Several gut bacteria can degrade oxalate and likely play an essential role in protecting against hyperoxaluria. The role that these oxalate-degrading bacteria, collectively referred to as the oxalobiome, play in the pathophysiology of EH has not been elucidated. We developed a novel computational method to perform the first comprehensive study of human oxalate-degrading microbes. We defined their individual contributions to overall oxalate degradation in vivo in healthy and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) population, a population at risk for EH. Our data showed that IBD patients have a reduction in the function of the oxalobiome associated with higher levels of fecal oxalate, suggesting that this population might benefit from the restoration of the oxalobiome. Hence, this proposal’s scientific premise is that the microbiome is an important determinant of urinary oxalate (UOx) levels and that with greater knowledge of the oxalobiome’s biology, we can manipulate it to prevent EH and kidney stones. Our overall hypothesis is that the oxalobiome function determines UOx. As a corollary, we hypothesize that the microbiome can be therapeutically targeted to reduce hyperoxaluria and the risk of kidney stones. To test this hypothesis, we propose studies that leverage our expertise in conducting microbiome trials and microbiome functional analyses in addition to our experience in performing humanizations. Our first aim is to analyze associations of oxalobiome alterations with UOx levels in patients with EH. We will place healthy and EH subjects on controlled diets before and after inducing their oxalobiome with daily oxalate supplementation to analyze the oxalobiome structure, using metagenomic sequencing, and function, using metatranscriptomic sequencing. We will identify the oxalobiome members with the highest oxalate metabolic activity in healthy and EH subjects, and those whose absence is associated with the development of hyperoxaluria. Global analysis of the microbiome dynamics and networks will allow us to identify bacterial taxa that are associated with lower UOx in EH and healthy adults. Our second aim is to determine whether human-to-mouse transfer of whole and enriched oxalobiome communities results in reduced urinary oxalate. For this aim, we will develop an EH IBD mouse model and perform human-to-mouse transfer of whole and enriched oxalobiome communities to evaluate its effects on UOx. Deciphering the oxalobiome function in EH, using recently developed technologies, in conjunction with our targeted computational methods, and then testing our hypotheses in mouse models, will permit us to develop promising microbiological approaches to control hyperoxaluria in EH."

Schizophrenia and related psychotic illnesses are neurodevelopmental disorders with evidence of pathological
changes beginning in utero; neuromotor and neurocognitive abnormalities in the premorbid period;
subsyndromal psychotic symptoms in the prodromal period of illness (also called clinical high risk, CHR); and
full manifestation of a psychotic syndrome during late adolescence or early adulthood. CHR research over the
past 2+ decades, has provided (i) important insights into risk factors for later conversion to full psychotic
illness, (ii) the development of a “Psychosis Risk Calculator”, (iii) biomarkers linked to psychosis riskand (iv)
evidence of dynamic brain changes that are likely present before the onset of illness and continue to evolve
into the first episode psychosis (FEP), as well as into more chronic forms of psychosis. Despite these
advances in our understanding of the CHR state, the longer-term outcomes (5+ years), and the trajectory of
diagnoses, symptoms and psychosocial function have been seldom investigated in this population. Meta-
analyses show that 20-30% of identified CHR individuals develop psychosis within 2 years. Little is known
about what type of psychosis (affective versus non-affective) ""declares itself"" after evidence of the initial
conversion to psychosis, the rate of later psychotic conversion (i.e. post 2-3-year follow-up periods) or risk
factors that might predict a later onset of psychosis. The majority of individuals who meet CHR criteria do not
develop overt psychosis within 2 years but demonstrate outcomes ranging from complete remission to
continued symptoms and functional impairment, at least within this relatively short time frame. Longer-term
follow-up of CHR individuals provides a unique and rare opportunity to investigate the full trajectory of illness
from CHR -> First Episode -> Chronic Illness, in addition to longer-term outcomes in symptomatic individuals
who did not develop psychosis within 2 years after ascertainment. Substantial evidence already exists for
multiple biomarker abnormalities in CHR subjects. Specifically, CHR youth show deficits in neurocognition,
regional cortical gray matter, event related potential (ERP) amplitudes as well as higher polygenic risk scores
(PRS), inflammatory markers and cortisol relative to comparison subjects. Biomarkers also predict who will
convert to psychosis and functional outcomes at 2 years. However, it is not known whether these biomarkers
predict longer term conversion and outcomes. The Specific Aims are to 1) Perform long-term (5-20 year)
diagnostic, symptom and functional assessments of up to 2000 individuals who previously met CHR criteria,
some of whom converted to psychosis, across 9 academic centers. 2) Determine the 5+ year psychotic
conversion rate of CHR individuals and use baseline demographic, clinical, functional, neurocognitive and
biomarker data to predict longer term functional and diagnostic outcomes of individuals who convert to
psychosis and 3) Investigate the long-term diagnostic and functional outcomes of CHR individuals who do not
convert to psychosis and test whether outcomes are influenced by treatment and substance use."

Bacterial virulence often relies on the ability of pathogens to secrete effectors that facilitate diverse processes
such as biofilm formation and immune evasion. Gram-negative bacteria have evolved to encode secretion
systems to transport proteins across the cell envelope, thereby facilitating pathogenesis. The canonical type VIII
secretion system (T8SS), which is found in Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp., employs the outer membrane
(OM) pore CsgG to secrete curli subunits across the OM where extensive networks of curli amyloid fibers are
formed, serving as a scaffold for biofilm formation. A system closely related to the T8SS is the holdfast anchor
of Caulobacter crescentus, which is a complex consisting of the CsgG homolog, HfaB, and two proteins secreted
via HfaB to the bacterial surface. The complex anchors holdfast polysaccharide to the cell, facilitating biofilm
formation. Therefore, the T8SS and a related system function in biofilm formation through distinct processes.
We recently identified a broadly conserved three-gene operon in Gram-negative bacteria that encodes a
CsgG/HfaB homolog. Notably, this operon is found in numerous pathogens that do not produce curli/holdfast,
implying a divergent role for CsgG homologs. To investigate the function of this operon, we first employed
Acinetobacter baumannii as a model. Intriguingly, we found that mutation of the operon results in the absence
of surface-associated poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), the major polysaccharide component of Acinetobacter
biofilms. Accordingly, mutants are attenuated in biofilm formation. We next extended our study of the operon to
another Gram-negative pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Similarly, mutation resulted in decreased Congo
red binding, indicative of a reduction in biofilm-associated polysaccharides (e.g., Pel and Psl). Accordingly,
biofilm formation was significantly attenuated. Based on this data and the known function of HfaB, we
hypothesize that this three-gene operon encodes a novel variant of the T8SS that is widely distributed
in Gram-negative pathogens and plays a role in attachment of biofilm-associated polysaccharides to the
cell surface. To test this, the following aims are proposed; In Aim 1, molecular approaches will be used to
characterize the localization of and interactions between components of the proposed T8SS variant in A.
baumannii and P. aeruginosa, as well as determine its structure. In Aim 2, we will assess the role of the T8SS
in anchoring polysaccharides to the membrane in A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Additionally, we will identify
effectors of the putative T8SS variant in both bacteria. In Aim 3, using A. baumannii as a model, we will
determine the role of the putative T8SS in virulence using the clinically-relevant pneumonia and catheter-
associated UTI (CAUTI) murine infection models. In all, these Aims will assess the function(s) of a novel
secretion system involved in key aspects of pathogenesis in two Gram-negative bacteria of significant public
health concern. Moreover, as this operon is broadly conserved in Gram-negative bacteria, results from this
research will impact our understanding of secretion and virulence of diverse pathogens."

This proposal focuses on the fact that 400 children and young adults develop rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) each
year, and the vast majority of those with high-risk disease will not be long term, disease-free survivors. One of
the major drivers of high-risk disease is the presence of PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein. In what is commonly
referred to as fusion-positive (FP) RMS, next generation DNA and RNA sequencing tools and molecular and cell
biological approaches have yet to uncover targetable cancer drivers. As such, the treatment for these children
and young adults has not fundamentally changed for several decades!
Major challenges to unraveling FP-RMS and the biology of PAX3-FOXO1 are at least two-fold: First, we know
much about the biology of the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion protein, including the fact that cooperating genetic or
epigenetic changes are needed for it to drive RMS formation and progression. But our knowledge is not
sophisticated enough to focus on the subset of cooperating genetic/epigenetic changes that can be leveraged
as therapeutic vulnerabilities. Second, though some elegant, experimental models exist for FP-RMS, pure
isogenic systems in which PAX3-FOXO1 expression can be quickly and completely turned “on” and “off” are not
available. We are convinced that solving both of these challenges will provide a foundational step toward
identifying actionable targets that are driven by the oncogenic fusion protein in FP-RMS.
Over the next two years, we can accomplish this by completing two complementary but independent aims. First,
we apply an innovative computational pipeline to nominate oncogenic drivers and tumor suppressors based on
genetic and epigenetic changes in FP-RMS, and functionally validate them in a CRISPR/Cas9-based “mini-pool”
assay using both FP and fusion-negative RMS models. Second, we will develop and validate a new degron-
based system in which human PAX3-FOXO1 can be controlled in a dynamic and reversible fashion in native
RMS cells and PDX models. Among other things, this system created in Aim 2 will be utilized to identify how the
key drivers and suppressors from Aim 1 are controlled by PAX3-FOXO1. Our success will lay the foundation for
future, hypothesis-directed studies of FP-RMS, generate sharable data and tools for the scientific community,
and illustrate a general approach to tackling other translocation-driven cancers that pose challenges similar to
FP-RMS."

The skin (epidermis) is responsible for protecting the body and works as a specialized, vital defensive barrier.
Upon injury, the immediate response of the epidermis and its stem cells aims to reestablish local homeostasis.
Extensive injuries, often observed in burn patients, compromise the epidermal homeostasis, which leads to
dehydration, possible severe infections, and death. New therapeutic strategies designed to improve healing and
burn injuries are critically needed. Our translation-focused innovative strategy aims to develop mechanism-based
and material engineering-driven therapies to augment epidermal healing. Here, we are developing novel and
exciting biodegradable scaffolds for the controlled delivery of key recombinant proteins and cells to positively
reestablish an epidermal barrier and wound closure. We propose to study how this novel therapeutic strategy
affects the skin stem cells and wound healing process. Furthermore, we will determine the therapeutic
effectiveness of 3D tissue engineering on burn wounds using bioprinting technology. Our positive results will
improve the mechanistic understanding of how patient-originated stem cells and epidermal cells along with 3D
bioprinting contribute to the healing of burn wounds. By accomplishing these specific aims, we will aid in the
management of burn patients, using limited donor tissues and help to reduce burn patients’ recovery time."

Despite the development of potent anti-retroviral therapy (ART) that successfully suppresses virus replication in
the majority of people living with HIV (PLWH), there is no treatment that can cure this infection entirely. The
major obstacle in eradicating HIV is the persistence of various anatomical viral reservoirs (VRs), including the
central nervous system (CNS), that have the capacity to produce infectious virus and systemically spread within
a short period upon cessation of ART in all, with few exceptional cases. Therefore, developing novel interventions
aimed at reducing or eliminating the VRs is one of the key priorities for HIV research. In response to RFA-MH-
20-701, our application proposes basic science and preclinical research in SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs)
to model aspects of VR in the CNS-resident myeloid cells of PLWH, and to investigate the efficacy of the novel
pharmacologic strategy to prevent establishment of HIV persistence in the CNS. Thus, based on the
observations outlined in this application we hypothesize that the disruption of PMC formation during acute phase
of infection will limit the seeding and maintenance of VR and, as a consequence, the extent of viral rebound in
the CNS following analytical therapy interruption (ATI). Three aims are proposed: (1) To investigate whether the
systemic disruption of PMC formation during acute phase of infection, regulates viral persistence in the CNS; (2)
To investigate whether the systemic disruption of PMC formation during acute phase of infection, regulates the
kinetics and extent of viral rebound after ATI; and (3) To investigate whether the systemic disruption of PMC
formation during acute phase of infection, regulates the neuroinflammation and synaptodendritic damages
associated with long-term ART and ATI. These aims will be achieved by (i) using a well-established model of
SIV-infected RMs treated with suppressive ART, and (ii) performing in vivo Ab-mediated disruption of PMC
formation during acute phase of untreated infection. Revealing the mechanisms through which platelets regulate
the persistence of HIV in myeloid cells will provide a critical understanding of how these cellular interactions
function in mammalian cells, and an insight into how a potential HIV cure can be achieved in PLWH."
10890115,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proteasome is the main intracellular protease and is responsible for degrading thousands of different
proteins. The main signal for degradation by the proteasome is thought to be the post-translational attachment
of ubiquitin molecules onto a substrate protein. While some proteasome substrates have been reported to be
targeted to the proteasome without the use of ubiquitin, the extent and mechanism of ubiquitin-independent
proteasomal degradation remain unclear. We have recently identified hundreds of peptides that, when fused to
the C-terminus of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), are degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-
independent manner. Here, we propose to investigate the mechanism of this ubiquitin-independent
degradation and determine the endogenous substrates of this pathway.
First, we will determine if the EGFP fusion substrates are recognized by the proteasome directly, or if they are
shuttled to the proteasome by an intervening factor (Aim 1). Next, we will characterize the interaction between
the receptor and substrates using a combination of genetic and biochemical methods (Aim 2). Finally, we will
identify endogenous substrates of the ubiquitin-independent pathway (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments will
characterize in detail this newly-uncovered ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathway, which may have
profound implications for our understanding of the proteasome and of protein homeostasis more generally.
I will perform this research as a postdoctoral fellow under the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Elledge at Brigham
and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School (HMS) and into my future independent research career at a top
U.S. institution. To accomplish my proposed aims, I will need to learn essential skills in the K99 period from Dr.
Elledge pertaining to advanced genetic screening techniques. I have assembled a team of collaborators and
advisors from around HMS (Dr. Alfred Goldberg, Dr. Wade Harper, Dr. Eric Fisher, Dr. Phil Cole, and Dr.
Eugene Oh) who complement my skill set and will help me effectively accomplish my proposed projects and
prepare for my future independent career. The local training environment in the Elledge lab and at HMS will
support me with all the materials, equipment, and professional development opportunities necessary to
become a world-class researcher. Receiving the K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award would provide me
with critical resources to realize my project and career goals."

Training in the application of chemical principles is essential for modern research across a number of disciplines
ranging from Chemistry and Biochemistry to Biology, Engineering and Medicine. Acknowledging this need, NC
State University has launched a new research and training program called the Chemistry of Life Program (CLP)
and initiated an innovative graduate training program, the Chemistry of Life Training Program (CLTP), as a core
element. A key aspect of this program is core training, both lecture and experimental, in core chemical biology
principles and techniques. This not only facilitates completion of the students’ dissertation research, but also
lays the basis for career opportunities in academic, government, and industrial research settings. To achieve
this, the CLTP has partnered with the Comparative Medicine Institute and Biotechnology Training Program to
synergize this program across our campus though at least 4 Colleges and 7 Departments. A trans-departmental
Executive Committee will lead the operation of the CLTP and oversee sub-committees focusing on program
elements. The specific objectives of the training program are: 1) Ensure technical proficiency and training in
responsible and rigorous science; 2) Provide an educational and training experience that is in line with graduate
students’ expectations for an interdisciplinary future; and, 3) Nurture robust PhD graduation outcomes. Six slots
(three in year 1) are requested that will be augmented by four slots (two in year 1) from University resources.
The program requirements include a minor in the Chemistry of Life; a course in professional development/
scientific rigor and reproducibility; courses in research ethics; and an annual research symposium/retreat. These
requirements are in addition to those associated with the student’s particular Department or Program for the
doctoral degree. During their two-year appointment to the training grant, trainees will also benefit from an
exploratory laboratory rotation program, co-mentorship across disciplines, access to development workshops on
topics like research commercialization, and the opportunity to be guided through mentorship of undergraduate
researchers on a team science project. This program will also provide a central focus for faculty of the various
disciplines involved in this training effort to seek out new opportunities for formal and informal research
collaboration as part of the broader CLP program."

Racial/ethnic minorities are at a higher risk for age-related cognitive dysfunction compared to non-Hispanic
(NH) Whites. The mechanisms underlying this disparity are not well understood. Exposure to air pollution may
be one important driver of these disparities. Recent epidemiologic studies suggest that increased exposure to
air pollution increases risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). Compared to NH Whites,
racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to live in neighborhoods with higher levels of air pollution. No prior
research, however, has quantified the contribution of air pollution as a driver of racial/ethnic disparities in
ADRD. The scientific objective of this research is to evaluate air pollution as a potential driver of racial/ethnic
disparities in ADRD and to understand the potential implications of air quality regulations on ADRD risk. We
will focus this research on disparities between Mexican American and NH White racial/ethnic groups. This
project uses an innovative approach to combine data from two existing cohort studies: The Sacramento Area
Latino Study on Aging and the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study. We will harmonize outcome and exposure
data from the two cohorts and examine whether the effect of air pollution on ADRD risk varies across
racial/ethnic groups. We will also examine whether air pollution drives disparities in ADRD by examining
racial/ethnic differences in air pollution exposure, individual- and neighborhood-level susceptibility to air
pollution. Finally, we will measure the potential impacts of air quality regulations on ADRD risk, using air quality
regulations related to seaports as an example. The proposed research will leverage advanced causal inference
methods including econometric quasi-experimental study designs to carry out the proposed research. This
research plan is complemented by a mentored training plan that builds upon the candidate’s background in
environmental epidemiology and includes coursework, structured mentoring, and experiential learning in the
following areas: 1) racial/ethnic disparities in ADRD, 2) environmental health disparities, 3) harmonization of
cognitive data, 4) air quality regulations, and 5) application of advanced social epidemiology and causal
inference methods. Together, the proposed research and training plan will prepare the candidate for a
successful independent research career dedicated to identifying environmental determinants of healthy aging,
especially in racial/ethnic minority populations."

Statement of the Problem:
Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP), defined as pain lasting longer than two-months after surgery, is a significant
public health problem affecting up to 80% of patients presenting for surgery. There are far-reaching
consequences for quality of life and physical and emotional functioning for those affected by CPSP and
complicating this crisis is the number of opioids prescribed after surgery with over 80% of patients receiving
opioid prescriptions after low-risk surgery. Integrative research and effective treatment strategies are lacking.
Overview of Research in the Laboratory:
My grant funded research, including my current K23 Award, has focused on identifying biopsychosocial
predictors of CPSP through the use of pre-clinical and clinical models and assuming a life-span perspective for
identifying predictors and prevention of CPSP. In 2013, I published the largest prospective study to date
identifying long-term pain trajectories and predictors of CPSP in young people and in 2018 results of Aim 1 of
my K23 Award, utilizing an animal model of CPSP, received Editor’s Choice. My approach is to integrate clinical,
psychological, and brain measures in order to understand the neurobiological processes that contribute to the
evolution or resilience of CPSP.
Goals for the Next 5 Years:
In the next 5 years, I will continue to utilize a translational approach to examine risk factors for CPSP and extend
upon my K23 work to: 1) utilize psychophysics and neuroimaging to understand the effects of CPSP on synaptic
plasticity from adolescence into adulthood and 2)
evaluate the effects of an evidence-based behavioral pain
intervention, compared to Treatment as Usual, on the fNIRS signal in groups of adolescent and adult patients
diagnosed with CPSP in order to compare Responders (improvement in pain severity, interference, &
functioning) vs. Non-Responders.
The projects outlined in the MIRA will be accomplished by my continued
collaborations with colleagues who have expertise in surgery, pain psychophysics, neuroscience, and
neuroimaging.
Overall Vision of the Research Program:
The goals of the R35 will be to: 1) enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of CPSP; 2) provide a metric
to follow patients with CPSP in the clinic; 3) provide a metric for those who will chronify; 4) understand the age-
related differences in CPSP; and 5) define an initial paradigm that may enhance our capability for developing
individually tailored patient-oriented interventions at both a behavioral and pharmacological level."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Translational Technologies Core will support and provide expertise related to genetics and neuroimaging
throughout the Center. It is well known that genetic factors are important in modulating risk of alcohol use disorder
(AUD) and related traits. Genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic risk loci for
AUD, for problematic alcohol use, and for quantity-frequency measures such as AUDIT-C and drinks per week.
Major function of the Genetics component will be to support microarray genotyping for each of the projects
(including pilot projects) involving human subjects, for the purpose of identifying genotype/phenotype
associations based on polygenic risk scores (PRS) of AUD and related traits. The Illumina Global Diversity Array
(GDA) – also used by the “All of Us” research project, and with good coverage of all major US population groups
and pharmacogenomic content, will be genotyped on all CTNA subjects. Most GWAS have focused on
European-ancestry populations; we will also use the best available methodology to study non-European
populations in a PRS context. Genetics component investigators will advise Center investigators on issues
related to genetics studies. We will also bring to bear a rich dataset of GWASed subjects with alcohol and other
substance dependencies that can be used to test hypothesis related to Center findings and goals; and we will
continue pilot work in related topics of interest, e.g., epigenetics and transcriptomics of alcohol dependence. In
turn, the Neuroimaging and Computational Neuroscience Component of the TTC will serve two key support
goals across the Center: i) Neuroinformatics Acquisition and Harmonization Support: Building on the prior
iteration of the Center, the TTC will provide a robust and centralized database for multi-modal neuroimaging,
processing, integration and analytics. Specifically, all CTNA imaging data collection will be harmonized with the
standardized imaging protocols developed by the Human Connectome Project (HCP). This will enable
acquisition and analysis at dramatically enhanced spatial and temporal resolution across the entire Center,
building programmatically on deep investments by the imaging community in these state-of-the-art data
collection tools. Moreover, the TTC will feature an integration between the field-wide accepted XNAT (eXtensible
Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit) database standard and the novel Yale-developed Quantitative Neuroimaging
Environment & ToolboX (Qu|Nex) – a cutting-edge ‘turnkey’ container neuroimaging system built collaboratively
with the HCP team. Notably, the. XNAT-Qu|Nex integration serves the framework for the ‘Connectome
Coordinating Facility’, which we propose to deploy here for the entire Center. ii) Computational Neuroscience
Support: The TTC will provide analytic support for the computational modeling and integration of innovative
techniques for neuroimaging analysis using whole brain high-resolution transcriptomic data obtained from the
Allen Human Brain Atlas. Collectively, the TTC will serve as a central state-of-the-art integrated informatics
database and computational analytic resource for CTNA projects involving genetics and neuroimaging."

which I will build to reach this goal. My track record of success is evidenced by the publication of high-impact
original reports and the receipt of 3 grants. I have distinguished myself as a national leader and received
awards for my research from the Sleep Research Society, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM),

mentor Dr. Klar Yaggi (Sleep Medicine), an expert in conducting epidemiologic studies aimed at understanding
the health outcomes of sleep disorders. I also have a team of advisors, selected based on their expertise in
aging, sleep, qualitative and mixed-methods research, circadian biology and analysis, and instrument
development. I have outlined a rigorous program of training that draws upon the wealth of resources across
Yale University, including the Program on Aging/Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center, as
well as national training opportunities in mixed methods research and leadership development. These
resources, and the support of the Sections of Geriatrics and Sleep Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine,
provide an ideal environment for my career development and execution of the proposed research.
Mentored Research Project: Sleep-wake disturbances are associated with important adverse outcomes in
older persons, including cognitive and functional decline. Our prior work has demonstrated that these
disturbances are under-diagnosed in older persons, which may be due to the poor sensitivity of existing sleep
questionnaires, the frequent co-occurrence of multiple sleep-wake disturbances, and the burdensome nature of
objective sleep testing. We propose to develop and test age-appropriate, comprehensive subjective and
objective sleep assessment tools to facilitate identification of older persons with sleep-wake disturbances.
To accomplish this, we will assess sleep-wake disturbances using a broader construct termed, “sleep
deficiency”, which is a condition causing functional impairment as a result of a deficit in sleep quality, sleep
duration, and/or sleep that is out-of-sync with the body's natural clock (i.e., non-circadian sleep). The overall
objective is to develop and pilot test tools to identify sleep deficiency in older persons. Future work will validate
these tools, which can be used to target interventions to improve sleep health and prevent adverse outcomes."
10867381,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Therapeutic interventions, such as exposure therapy, reduce pathological fear in patients with anxiety
disorders. Extinction is a fundamental form of learning that underlies these therapies. A major challenge to
extinction-based therapies is that the fear reduction is often transient and bound to the place or context in
which therapy occurs. For example, when patients confront phobic objects or reminders of trauma outside of
the clinic, their fear often relapses. This reveals that extinction learning does not erase fear memory, but yields
a context-dependent “safety” memory that inhibits the expression of fear in the place where it is learned.
Accordingly, the long-term goal of this project is to understand the neural substrates of fear extinction and
relapse, particularly the specific brain circuits involved in the contextual control of extinction. Work in the
current funding period of this project has focused on renewal, a relapse of extinguished fear outside the
extinction context. Importantly, it was found that the hippocampus (HPC) mediates renewal by inhibiting
retrieval of extinction memories encoded by the infralimbic (IL) cortex. In the extinction context, the
suppression of conditioned fear is thought to involve IL inhibition of amygdala neurons encoding fear memory.
However, recent data challenge this notion—silencing prefrontal-amygdala projections does not impair
extinction retrieval. Hence, the precise mechanism for suppressing fear after extinction is still unknown.
Recent work on this project suggests a novel alternative: the mPFC may suppress the reactivation of
hippocampus-dependent fear memories to facilitate context-dependent extinction memory retrieval. The
mPFC projects to the HPC via the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE), and RE inactivation or chemogenetic
silencing of mPFCgRE projections impairs the expression of extinction. Based on this work, it is hypothesized
that the RE mediates mPFC-HPC interactions required for context-dependent retrieval of extinction
memories. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims. The first aim explores whether the mPFC,
particularly IL, suppresses the retrieval of extinguished fear memories via RE projections to the HPC. The
second aim examines whether the activity of HPC ensembles representing fear and extinction memories are
regulated by the RE. The third aim determines whether the RE coordinates oscillatory synchrony in HPC and
mPFC during extinction retrieval. The proposed work will elucidate the specific neural circuits mediating the
expression of extinction and has important clinical implications for developing therapeutic interventions that
target these neural circuits to promote fear suppression and oppose relapse."

10878956,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of alcoholic liver disease, with a
short-term mortality as high as 20-50%. Traditionally, alcoholic hepatitis is thought to result mostly from
hepatocellular damage. However, recent evidence suggests that alcoholic hepatitis also results in cholestatic
liver injury, and that worsening cholestasis in fact is associated with a worse prognosis. This is an important
concept because cholestasis generally is a separate process from hepatocellular injury, and so its presence
may suggest previously unappreciated pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Cholestasis
may reflect impaired secretory function of hepatocytes, but often instead reflects impaired secretion by bile
duct epithelial cells, or cholangiocytes. A variety of liver diseases are largely or entirely due to cholangiocyte
damage or dysfunction, and these cholangiopathies are characterized by cholestasis. Despite their widely
different etiologies, loss of expression of type 3 inositol trisphosphate receptors (ITPR3) from cholangiocytes is
a final common pathway among the cholangiopathies that results in cholestasis. ITPR3 plays this important
role because it is the primary intracellular calcium release channel in cholangiocytes, and its expression is
necessary to mediate biliary fluid and bicarbonate secretion. This project will investigate the idea that
cholangiocytes are involved in the cholestasis that occurs in alcoholic hepatitis and that, as in other
cholangiopathies, this also is due to loss of ITPR3. In particular, this project will test the hypothesis that the
cholestatic changes that occur in alcoholic hepatitis are due in part to direct interactions between
cholangiocytes and neutrophils. Moreover, the relative contribution of cholangiocytes and hepatocytes to
cholestasis will be determined. This will be tested through three specific aims: (1) We will determine whether
and why the neutrophils in alcoholic hepatitis behave abnormally towards cholangiocytes; (2) We will
determine whether and why the cholangiocytes in alcoholic hepatitis have intrinsic secretory defects; and (3)
We will identify targets for therapy based on the mechanism(s) of neutrophil-cholangiocyte interactions. This
project has the potential to fundamentally shift our understanding of alcoholic hepatitis, by establishing a new
role for cholangiocytes in this disease and by determining how neutrophils interact with them to cause
cholestasis. Such a paradigm shift in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disorder may in
turn define new targets for therapy. Considering that no new therapy for alcoholic hepatitis has been shown to

10861004,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Organ development and function requires that neurons establish precise cellular interactions with tissue­resident
support cells. For example, touch­sensing somatosensory neurons project peripheral axons to the skin, where
they interact with specialized skin cell types. These specialized skin cells regulate axon development and modu­
late neuronal responses to cutaneous stimuli. Reciprocally, somatosensory neurons influence skin homeostasis.
Although the anatomy of vertebrate skin is well described, little is known about the dynamic process of sensory
specialization of the skin, partly because most studies have focused on mammalian embryos, which has limited
access to live­imaging.
The external development and the availability of unique transgenic tools make zebrafish an ideal model for study­
ing the dynamics of neuron and tissue maturation. This proposal investigates the development of a novel popula­
tion of specialized sensory cells that we identified in the zebrafish epidermis. Preliminary cellular, molecular and
developmental analyses suggest that these zebrafish epidermal cells are the equivalent of mammalian Merkel
cells, specialized mechanosensory cells that detect touch. The experiments proposed here investigate how de­
velopment of these specialized epidermal cells is coordinated with skin and nervous system maturation. In Aim
1, we will use live­imaging and genetic manipulation to characterize how sensory cell addition occurs during skin
growth. Aim 2 investigates the establishment of interactions between axons and epidermal cells and how neurons
promote skin specialization. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use in vivo photoconversion, lineage tracing and molecular
techniques to track the trajectory of skin­resident stem cells as they differentiate into sensory cells. Collectively,
these studies will provide mechanistic insights into organ specialization during development, interactions between
peripheral axons and their target tissues, and potentially point to the origins of touch­sensing disorders."

 The prevalence of maternal overweight and obesity continues to increase in the U.S. and spans the
spectrum of age, race and ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Alarmingly, 1 in 10 infants and toddlers are
obese, and 1 in 5 youth are both obese and at-risk for pediatric Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
NAFLD can begin in utero with longitudinal studies showing an increased risk of NAFLD in adolescents born to
obese mothers. Some features of NAFLD are similar in children and adults, yet portal fibrosis and inflammation
are more common in pediatric NASH patients than adult patients, and portends a rapid progression to end-stage
liver disease in early adulthood for reasons that remain poorly understood. Our group has spent the past decade
developing and characterizing a sophisticated nonhuman primate (NHP) model of high fat/calorically dense
maternal diet consumption that has critically important developmental and physiological similarities to humans.
 Data from our well-characterized NHP model demonstrate that maternal Western-style diet (MWSD) triggers
fetal hepatic collagen deposition in the portal triad and stellate cell activation that persists in 3-year-old (3YO)
juvenile animals, despite switching to a healthy chow diet at weaning. Notably, 2 miRNAs with critical roles in
liver metabolism and inflammatory responses were significantly increased (miR-122) or decreased (miR-34a) in
fetal liver and partially normalized when obese mothers were switched to a healthy chow diet. Our results suggest
these miRNAs are diet-sensitive and candidate targets for epigenetic priming of NAFLD early in life. Our
preliminary data in 3YO NHP offspring also show that MWSD reprograms hematopoietic stem cell progenitors
(HSPC)s and bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) to a glycolytic phenotype and a blunted response to
IL-4, suggesting decreased anti-inflammatory capacity and impaired Mφ ability to assume a reparative
phenotype. Given the importance of M2-like Mφ for healing liver injury,our overall hypothesis is that MWSD alters
miRNAs in liver in parallel with epigenetically reprogrammed HSPC and liver Mφ before birth. This leads to
ongoing production of hyper-inflammatory Mφ and the inability to resolve liver injury across the lifespan. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanistic basis by which MWSD drives epigenetic
remodeling and the pathogenesis for NAFLD beginning in utero. In this revised application, our Aims are to: 1)
Test the hypothesis that MWSD alters binding of fetal miR-34a, and miR-122 to specific targets in fetal liver, and
identify macrophage sub-sets in Juvenile livers using single cell RNAseq; 2) Test the hypothesis that MWSD
drives pro-inflammatory functions in isolated fetal and 3YO HSPC and liver Mφ through distinct transcriptional
and epigenetic mechanisms. 3) Test the hypothesis that MWSD disrupts BA signaling and HNF4α in MWSD
hepatocytes and preferentially affects periportal hepatocytes in fetal and post-natal livers.Taken together, using
fetal and Juvenile NHP, which have developmental features similar to humans, we will decipher how MWSD
exposure triggers epigenetic and inflammatory modifications in HSPC and liver Mφ that drive novel pathways
underlying pediatric NAFLD."

Mosaic loss of Y chromosome in the hematopoietic system (mLOY) is the most common post-zygotic mutation
in humans. This form of aneuploidy, in a subset of hematopoietic stem cells, increases with age and affects
~45% of men by age 70. Epidemiological data have associated this condition with mortality, cancer, dementia,
and other age-associated conditions. Recently, our group has produced the first causal, mechanistic, and
epidemiological data linking mLOY to age-associated heart failure and other conditions associated with an
exuberant fibrotic response. A mouse model of mLOY showed diminished lifespan and increased progression of
age-associated pathologies, including cardiomyopathy, lung and renal fibrosis, and cognitive decline. The mLOY
recipient mice also showed increased progression of cardiac fibrosis and increased number of fibroblasts in the
myocardial tissue after cardiac injury. Further analysis using single cell RNA sequencing revealed that the mLOY
macrophages showed both an increased propensity towards pro-fibrotic macrophage polarization and increased
expression of pro-fibrotic ligands. These novel findings suggest that age-related mLOY in blood cells may be a
strong driver of tissue aging and fibrosis. However, the mechanistic connections between Y chromosome loss,
immune cell dysfunction, systemic fibrosis, and aging are not yet known.
 Preliminary data suggests that mLOY macrophages may contribute to aging through multiple
mechanisms. Single cell RNA sequencing showed a reduced propensity of mLOY macrophages towards a pro-
inflammatory polarization, reduced expression of Il1b and Tnf, and reduced recruitment of leukocytes to injured
cardiac tissue. As inflammatory macrophage processes are required to clear senescent cells, mLOY may result
in the accumulation of senescent cells in tissues and thereby contribute to biological aging. Additionally, mLOY
macrophages show increased expression of Tgfb1, which can induce a mesenchymal transition in endothelial
cells and promote tissue fibrosis. Therefore, mLOY may promote this mesenchymal transition in aged tissues.
Finally, the effector locus on the Y chromosome that may be responsible for the cardiac fibrosis phenotype is a
gene with histone modification function. This effector locus may regulate macrophage polarization through
histone modifications that allow for transcription factor binding and subsequent expression of pro-fibrotic genes.
Thus, I hypothesis that mLOY promotes aging phenotypes by accumulation of senescent cells and promotion
of mesenchymal transition through epigenetic modification of histones to dysregulate macrophage polarization.
To this end, I will use novel transgenic mouse models, advanced single cell analyses, and cell culture methods
to determine the effects of mLOY macrophages on aging phenotypes and to elucidate the mechanisms by
which mLOY regulates macrophage polarization. Within this transition project, my training plan will build on my
current expertise in cell biology and allow me to gain critical skills to establish and maintain an independent
research program investigating mLOY and aging phenotypes."
10867441,"Virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Proven treatments are limited to only a few viruses and even when treatments exist (e.g. acyclovir
for herpes simplex encephalitis) disability and death remain significant. Our knowledge of viral CNS infections,
particularly those involving the spinal cord, is limited and serves as a barrier against the development of novel
treatments for these devastating diseases. Enteroviruses are an important cause of virus-induced CNS
infections. Poliovirus is the most infamous member of the neurotrophic enteroviruses. However, several non-
polio human enteroviruses (NPEVs), including EV-D68, also target the CNS. NPEVs are common, causing an
estimated 10–15 million symptomatic annual infections in the US alone. Although most of these infections do
not result in CNS disease, these viruses can acquire the ability to be neuro-virulent. Recently, large outbreaks of
NPEVs have occurred worldwide that have been associated with neurologic disease and these viruses are
designated “re-emerging pathogens”. For example, in 2014, the United States experienced an epidemic of acute
flaccid myelitis (AFM) cases in children during a nationwide outbreak of previously rare enterovirus D68 (EV-
D68) respiratory disease. Approximately 50% of AFM patients had EV-D68 in respiratory secretions. However,
EV-D68 was not detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of any patient, preventing the establishment of a causative
link between EV-D68 and AFM. We have recently shown that many (including IL/52 and MO/47), but not all
(such as CA4231), clinical isolates of EV-D68 from the 2014 outbreak cause neurologic disease in neonatal mice
and propose to use this novel model of virus-induced CNS disease to define patterns and mechanisms of EV-
D68-induced paralysis. Using chimeric viruses we have demonstrated that the 5’ untranslated region (UTR)
and the viral structural proteins VP3 and VP1 are determinants of paralysis. In the proposed studies we will use
similar methods to determine which viral sequences are involved in specific mechanisms of paralysis, including
neuronal infectivity and apoptosis. An increased knowledge of pathogenic mechanisms that are involved in EV-
D68-induced CNS disease will inform the development of antivirals for EV-D68-induced AFM. In addition, by
focusing our efforts on host responses to EV-D68 infections our experiments may identify therapeutic
strategies that have broad spectrum applicability to additional EVs. Our studies may also have relevance for
other viral and non-viral causes of CNS disease."

Every living cell on the planet is covered by a dense layer of glycans. These complicated structures play critical
roles in many biological and disease processes. Functional studies and medical applications require well-defined
glycan structures. While automated peptide and nucleic acid syntheses have matured and allow non-specialists
to access defined standards, the synthesis of glycans and glycoconjugates is still often laborious, time-
consuming, and requires specialties. So far, only a few platforms have been introduced to automate chemical
syntheses of glycans but suffer from slow reaction rates, low selectivity, efficiency, and yields, especially in
preparing complex glycans. A mature and practical automated system to synthesize complex glycans is not
available. In the past decade, glycosyltransferases (GTs)-catalyzed reactions have been widely explored to
prepare diverse complex glycans. With perfect regio- and stereo-selectivity as well as high conversion rates,
they are attractive for automation. The challenge is tedious repeated process of separating intermediates and
the final product. This has been well overcome by solid-phase-based automation in peptide and nucleic acid
synthesis. But GTs are often much less active when the acceptor substrate is immobilized, causing slow
conversions and low yields. Catch-and-release strategies have the potential to solve the problem. In such
strategy, acceptors are tagged with a functional group, and “captured” on solid phase through specific
interactions between the group and the solid phase. After cleanup, they can be “released” using appropriate
solvents to disrupt the interaction. Several “catch-and-release” strategies have been introduced to expedite
enzymatic assembly of glycans, but all suffer from one major drawback: chemicals, organic solvents, high
concentrations of salts, etc, must be introduced to release glycans from solid phase. Thus, extra steps which
often cannot be easily realized on automated platforms have to be involved to clean up each intermediate for
the next round reaction and catch-and-release separation. This will greatly complicate and prolong automated
synthesis and decrease efficiency. We propose a simple catch-and-release strategy enabled by DNA
hybridization (Catch) and dehybridization (Release). In this strategy, the glycan an conveniently “captured” with
any GT reaction mixtures, and “released” using pure water. We believe this catch-and-release strategy is the
missing puzzle to tackle practical automated glycan synthesis. Iterative enzymatic assembly is already widely
employed to prepare complex glycans, and many liquid handling systems are commercially available. Upon the
success of current technology, these can be readily integrated to generate a practical and costless automated
platform for glycan synthesis (future work)."
10823271,"Efficient and cost-effective breast cancer risk stratification using whole-slide histopathology
images
Breast cancer prognosis depends highly on receptor status, as optimal treatment depends on
the presence or absence of overexpression of estrogen, progesterone, or HER-2/neu receptors.
To prevent over-treating patients with chemotherapy, it is crucial to quantify the risk of
recurrence for estrogen receptor (ER) positive (ER+), HER2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer. A
common assessment method to meet this need is the Oncotype DX (ODX) Recurrence Score.
Unfortunately, ODX and similar gene assays are expensive, time-consuming, and tissue
destructive. As an alternative, we propose estimating the ODX recurrence score using routine,
ubiquitous, and inexpensive hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of biopsies. There are other
efforts to predict ODX recurrence risk from H&E. These automated methods detect histological
primitives (e.g., nuclei) often in specific, also automatically detected, anatomical regions (e.g.,
ducts, tubules, lumen, epithelium, and stroma). Classification is performed into two or three risk
categories, often collapsing two categories into one. The performance of these models is
promising but still modest. One way to improve the performance of the models is to train on
larger datasets; however, annotating larger datasets is challenging. Here, we propose an
automated method to predict ODX recurrence risk without annotations. If successful, this
method would have a wide range of applications, including but not limited to the availability of an
inexpensive, web-based tool to predict ODX in developing countries or rural areas with internet
access where standard Oncotype Dx assay would be cost-prohibitive or take too long to obtain.
Furthermore, our method would find use in clinical research where valuable tumor tissue could
be saved by obtaining correlative research data based on standard H&E-stained slides."

Tissue-resident macrophages (TRMs) play fundamental roles in tissue homeostasis, immunity, and disease.
Thus, unlocking their biology is key to gaining a deeper knowledge of many human pathologies. TRMs are unique
from other hematopoietic cells, most of which are comparatively short-lived and continually replenished from the
bone marrow. Instead, TRMs form from yolk sac and fetal progenitors and persist into adult life through self-
renewal. Over time, and with kinetics specific to each tissue, these fetal-derived TRMs are replaced in most
tissues by bone marrow-derived monocytes, which may subsequently acquire a similar transcriptional profile to
their embryonic-derived counterparts. However, our understanding of universal factors that regulate TRMs
across tissues is limited. Cellular metabolism is one such factor that governs the differentiation trajectories of
various immune cell subsets, but how it shapes TRM differentiation, persistence, and function has yet to be
studied in detail. We previously identified polyamine metabolism, and its role in the synthesis of the amino acid
hypusine as a central axis governing macrophage metabolism and activation. We also showed that hypusine
synthesis directs the ability of T cells to take on distinct effector fates. These findings illuminated hypusine as a
focal coordinator of immune cell fate and effector programs. However, how hypusine contributes to tissue
immunity and TRM maintenance remains unknown. The sole protein to contain hypusine is the translation factor
eIF5A, in which a conserved lysine is enzymatically converted to hypusine in a two-step process via spermidine.
Hypusinated eIF5A promotes the translation of transcripts with specific sequence properties. Our goal in this
proposal is to gain deep understanding of TRM biology in homeostasis and disease by addressing hypusine
metabolism. Our central hypothesis is that hypusine regulates the differentiation of monocyte-derived cells into
TRMs and/or their maintenance in tissues, and that by targeting hypusine we can modulate macrophages to
benefit disease. We base this on our published work and striking preliminary data suggesting that hypusine
synthesis controls macrophage tissue-residency across multiple organs. Our approach will add new insight into
how short-lived precursor cells develop into long-lived TRMs that carry out functions essential for life. Importantly,
it will establish if hypusine synthesis is a tractable route to modulate TRMs in contexts where they influence
disease, such as with tumor-associated macrophages and cancer. We will test our central hypothesis by, 1)
investigating the role of hypusine synthesis in TRM formation and/or maintenance, 2) probing the mechanisms
through which hypusine governs macrophage tissue-residency, and 3) examining whether manipulating
hypusine synthesis in macrophages benefits anti-tumor immunity."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia among the elderly and the most prevalent age-
related neurodegenerative disease, affecting ~56 million individuals worldwide. Despite of its high heritability
(estimates ranging 60-80%) and many genetic variants (residing in tens of loci across the genome) identified
from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), our knowledge of the underlying genetic mechanisms remains
limited. Uncovering pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AD proves to be highly challenging. To
advance our mechanistic understanding of AD, we will first acquire and harmonize various in-house, protected
and public data, encompassing bulk and single cell RNA-seq data, GWAS summary statistics, array
genotyping and whole genome sequencing data, as well as functional genomic data. We will then analyze
them using a suite of computational methods and bioinformatics tools to generate cell-type-specific

validations will be carried out in iPSC-derived neural cells (particularly excitatory neurons and microglia), as
well as in iPSC-derived brain organoids involving diverse cell types including neurons, astrocytes, and
microglia. In these iPSC-derived cells and organoids models, we will leverage CRISPRi as well as knock-in
experimental technologies to perturb the most promising putatively causal regulatory DNA elements, and
evaluate the impact by measuring a cascade of molecular and cellular phenotypes including gene expression

The vaginal microbiome is associated with important health outcomes, including bacterial vaginosis (BV),
preterm birth, HIV risk, and cervical cancer, but mechanisms for these associations are unclear and current
microbiome-directed therapies have low efficacy. Metabolome alterations including high-level production of
amines like putrescine are a defining feature of BV and a major cause of symptoms, but underlying mechanisms
and host responses to BV-associated metabolites including amines are poorly characterized. In preliminary data
from a South African cohort with high BV prevalence, 60% of detectable metabolites in vaginal fluid significantly
differ between optimal Lactobacillus-dominant bacterial communities and non-optimal non-Lactobacillus-
dominant (NLD) communities. Strongly BV- and NLD-associated metabolites included putrescine and imidazole
propionate (ImP), both of which are known to have adverse host effects in non-vaginal diseases but whose
production and effects remain largely uncharacterized in the genital tract. These results suggest bacteria
comprising NLD communities express enzymes that produce these metabolites. The study will (1) characterize
metabolome and metagenome composition in additional cohorts to validate findings and identify candidate
enzymes for putrescine and ImP production, (2) characterize the enzymes in cultured vaginal bacteria and
assess effects of known pharmacologic inhibitors, and (3) assess effects of putrescine and ImP on metabolic
and inflammatory host responses and test whether they can be blocked by known host pathway inhibitors. The
results will elucidate vaginal metabolome-related pathophysiology and may directly identify candidate therapies.
 The PI is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Division of Infectious Diseases at
Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH); in addition to the research plan this proposal includes a five-year career
development plan. His career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist investigator studying
mechanisms of vaginal microbiome- and metabolome-mediated disease through bacteriologic, biochemical, and
immunologic approaches to identify novel therapies. The proposal builds on the PI’s prior experience studying
vaginal microbiome dynamics and investigating the physiology of bacterial species within the microbiome. The
current proposal significantly expands his scientific scope by investigating microbial determinants of vaginal
metabolome composition, identifying host pathways those metabolites affect, and testing pathway inhibitors. He
will pursue this research under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Doug Kwon, at the Ragon Institute of
MGH, MIT and Harvard and his co-mentor, Dr. Emily Balskus, at the Harvard University Department of Chemistry

Dr. Yerevanian will carry out the planned career development activities in the research and training environment
at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.
This research program utilizes the organism C. elegans, murine cell lines and mouse models to examine the
physiology of riboflavin depletion and identify the core molecular mechanisms that underpin the lifespan
extending effects of riboflavin depletion in C. elegans. The biology of riboflavin utilization and transport is strongly
conserved through metazoans, making it an attractive area to study as a translational target. The ability to
modulate cellular energetics and metabolic hormesis through riboflavin depletion may provide key therapeutic
targets for the complications of aging, particularly metabolic complications including insulin resistance, changes
in body composition and neurodegenerative diseases. Preliminary studies have already shown that riboflavin
depletion extends lifespan in C. elegans, and utilizes canonical pathways associated with longevity including
AMPK and FOXO. We hope to further elucidate the metabolic regulators of this process, including flavin co-
factor synthesis, mitochondrial energetics, and lipid metabolism. The investigator will utilize functional genomics
of C. elegans, metabolic assays of enzyme regulation, and novel mechanisms for altering cellular energetics to

Circadian rhythms are autonomous cycles of behavior and physiology that undergo routine disruption in modern
society due to the rise in shift work, exposure to blue light at night, disrupted sleep, and consumption of highly-
palatable high-fat diet. Molecular clocks are encoded by transcription feedback loops that drive the 24-hr sleep-
wake cycle and physiological rhythms in hormone levels, glucose metabolism, and energetics. In the previous
grant period, we revealed an essential function for both brain and peripheral clocks in rhythmic energy
homeostasis and glucose metabolism. We showed that morning/evening variation in chromatin conformation
controls -cell insulin secretion. We also showed that clock ablation in neurons of forebrain and midbrain impairs
appetitive drive, sleep/wake rhythms, energy balance, glucose tolerance, and transcription, although a gap
remains in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying rhythmic integration of behavior and metabolism.
Here we seek to extend our insight into circadian mechanisms linking behavior and metabolism. (i) In our first
aim, we will dissect the cell and molecular basis for genomic rhythms driving -cell function important in glucose
constancy across the sleep-wake cycle. (ii) In our second aim, we will identify the neurocircuit basis for rhythms
of hedonic and homeostatic feeding coordinating appetitive drive with glucose homeostasis. An innovation of our
work is the multidimensional integration of genetics, genomics, and behavioral analyses to gain molecular insight
into rhythmic -cell function and neuronal control of hunger. Ultimately, we are poised to uncover new insight
into how central and peripheral clocks impact physiology, findings which have broad implications for the
treatment and prevention of obesity and metabolic syndrome."

A heterozygous hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion in a single allele of the C9orf72 gene is the most
frequent known genetic cause of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two
fatal and irreversible neurodegenerative diseases. Given that there are no effective treatments for FTD (an
Alzheimer’s-related dementia) and ALS, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Targeting the
C9orf72 gene itself by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing may provide a curative intervention.
With the completion of the proposed IND-enabling studies, we will have developed a platform for allele-specific
gene therapy of the human mutant C9orf72 gene combining novel allele-specific editing with a novel AAV-LC.V1
convection-enhanced delivery platform. We will have addressed a number of open questions in the field,
including whether editing efficiencies in post-mitotic neurons differ from mitotic cells, how to deliver
CRISPR/Cas9 with multiple gRNAs to motor neurons in the cortex and spinal cord of mouse, whether it is
possible to reverse clinical phenotypes in pre-symptomatic vs. symptomatic mice, and whether CRISPR self-
deactivation decreases unwanted off-target editing and immune response in mice. The results of our experiments
will lead to rational design of IND dose finding studies in non-human primates and toxicology studies in rats,
inform clinical trial design, and accelerate gene editing for neurodegenerative disease toward the clinic."
10840867,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The experiments in this proposal focus on developing a therapy for Huntington's disease based upon Cas9 RNP
formulations that are complexed to amphiphilic delivery peptides (ADPs) and conjugated to PEG. We have
chosen Huntington's disease as a disease target because it is a fatal disease with no treatment, caused by a
well-defined genetic mutation. CRISPR-based genome editing holds tremendous potential for treating
Huntington's disease but has been challenging to develop because of delivery limitations. Two key challenges
need to be solved before CRISPR-based genome editing can be used clinically. First, strategies for efficiently
and safely delivering Cas9 and gRNA into neurons, after an intracranial injection, need to be developed. Second,
strategies that can enable large volumes of brain tissue (>1 cm) to be transfected after an intracranial injection
of CRISPR reagents must also be developed. This is particularly important for genome editing in large animals
because charged macromolecules, such as Cas9 enzymes or viruses, typically only diffuse 1–2 mm away from
the injection site after an intracranial injection.
We have recently developed a new strategy for performing genome editing in the brain using a combination of
convection-enhanced delivery (CED) combined with the Cas9 RNP complexed to new rationally designed
amphiphilic delivery peptides (ADPs). This new strategy for Cas9 RNP delivery has shown remarkable promise,
and was able to edit as much as 40% of the neurons in the vicinity of the injection site, after an intracranial
injection, using the Ai9 mouse model. In addition, we have also demonstrated that conjugation of PEG to the
Cas9 RNP dramatically enhances its distribution through brain tissue. Our Cas9 RNP + ADP formulations have
much higher brain transfection ability than other strategies based upon just the Cas9 RNP fused to ADPs or
nanoparticle based delivery methods. In addition, our formulation is based upon the Cas9 RNP, PEG and a well-
defined peptide, and is anticipated to be significantly easier to manufacture than viral or nanoparticle-based
formulations, as all the components – protein, gRNA, PEG, and peptide – can readily be produced under GMP
conditions and have a robust clinical track record. In this proposal, we will build upon the momentum of our
ongoing studies and will develop a Cas9 RNP formulation that can edit >50% of the mutant Huntington's gene
after a single intracranial injection, administered via CED, using an RNP formulation that has the manufacturing
and toxicology properties needed for performing IND-enabling studies. We propose the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: Develop RNP monoparticles that efficiently transfect large volumes of brain tissue.
Specific Aim 2. Rescue mice and rats from HD via editing of HTT using Cas9 RNP monoparticles.
Specific Aim 3. Safety and process development of Cas9 RNP monoparticles."

Translation of a laboratory discovery to a clinical trial generates many management and regulatory challenges.
Gene editing brings additional safety issues to the fore, such as the adverse consequences of off-target editing,
that require creativity and experience to properly investigate, quantify, and mitigate as needed. The Viral Vector
and Regulatory Core brings the necessary expertise and history of collaboration across U19 team members to
offer two critical services to this U19: scaled production of all AAV vectors to ensure consistently high quality of
these biological reagents for therapeutic testing in the projects; and practical guidance and support to help the
projects navigate the regulatory path to an IND submission. Key innovations include access to a scalable
manufacturing system for AAV9 available through the Translational Gene Therapy Core at UTSW, which is
directed by the Viral Vector and Regulatory Core Lead Steven Gray. The continuity of AAV product quality and
potency offered through the Translational Gene Therapy Core will streamline the regulatory process and avoid
costly and time-consuming bridging studies. A second innovation developed by the Core team are preclinical
and clinical immune-management protocols for delivery of non-self transgenes. Since any gene editing–based
treatment developed through this Program is expected to be viewed as non-self by the recipient's immune
system, incorporation of these strategies is likely to be critical for the preclinical and clinical success. Close
engagement with the Genome Editing Core on vector design and interpretation of genome editing results, and
with the Preclinical Mouse Model Core on study design to assure all assessments are aligned with IND
requirements, will be thoroughly woven into the pipeline to optimize efficiency. The approach to achieve the Viral
Vector and Regulatory Core's goals will leverage best practices based on the experience of the Core Lead,
supporting staff and consultants that have resulted in numerous successful pre-IND and IND submissions for
AAV-based therapeutics. The significance of the Core is that it will ensure that all activities in the projects and
other cores meet FDA quality expectations, and will work proactively to avoid unnecessary delays or work
repetition to meet those expectations. This is central to the overall aims of this U19 Program and is critical,
particularly for research labs that have not gone through the translational process. The Specific Aims are: 1) To
support the U19 projects by supplying AAV vectors; 2) To conduct an INTERACT meeting to understand FDA
expectations for pre-clinical proof of concept data of the lead project therapeutic entity; 3) To conduct a type B
pre-IND meeting and coordinate IND-enabling studies; and 4) To coordinate parties to assemble and submit an
allowable IND."

astrocytes of the granular cell layer, and fibrous astrocytes of the white matter. This proposal aims
at understanding mechanisms that regulate diverse astrocyte subpopulations in the cerebellum.
Our results strongly suggest that a transcription factor, Yin Yang 1 (YY1), is essential for
sustaining the distinct functions of astrocyte subpopulations in both the developing and the adult
cerebellum. Deletion of YY1 in cerebellar astrocytes manifests in contrasting effects in the
molecular layer versus the granular cell layer and white matter by post-natal day 20. We found
astrogliosis in the molecular layer associated with GFAP+ astrocyte hypertrophy and loss of typical
morphology whereas the numbers of GFAP+ astrocytes in the granular cell layer and white matter
were drastically diminished. Furthermore, we found that YY1 differentially alters gene expression
at the later stages of astrocyte development in a region-specific manner and is continuously
needed in mature astrocytes. To test the hypothesis that YY1-dependent chromatin architecture
is critical to execute and sustain programs that affect functions of diverse astrocyte
subpopulations in the cerebellum, we will: 1. Establish the effects of YY1 on the major functions
of subpopulations of cerebellar astrocytes, and 2. Obtain insights into the molecular mechanisms
by which YY1 regulates subpopulations of cerebellar astrocytes."

The inner membrane of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria contains lipids and proteins that are distinct from
those of mammalian cell membranes. Inner membranes therefore could be attacked by small molecules during
infection, when soluble host innate immunity damages the protective outer membrane barrier, increasing
access to chemicals. Exploration of molecules that a) interrupt pathogenesis in cell culture with minimal host
cell damage, and b) perturb inner membranes under broth conditions that permeabilize the outer membrane
has the potential to reveal whether bacterial virulence can be short-circuited by compounds that disturb inner
membranes but do not inhibit bacterial growth under standard broth conditions. An in-macrophage cell biology-
based method called SAFIRE appears to identify compounds that negatively affect bacterial inner membranes
while sparing host cell membranes. Within this application we propose to study a SAFIRE-identified compound,
D66, which appears to damage bacterial inner membranes without lysing them. Published and unpublished
preliminary data together indicate that D66 accesses bacterial inner membranes when the LPS layer is
damaged or efflux pumps are compromised, conditions consistent with the macrophage phagosome. However,
D66 disrupts inner membrane voltage rapidly and at concentrations that do not destroy the inner membrane
lipid bilayer, indicating that the compound is not causing bacterial lysis but is disturbing the membrane more
subtly. We hypothesize that D66 damages the bacterial cell membrane in a process that triggers stress
response pathways but does not cause rapid physical disruption of the lipid bilayer. We propose cell biological
and animal infection experiments to test this hypothesis."
10849854,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The average age at the time of spinal cord injury (SCI) has increased to 50.5 years old in the US. Observations
from several independent laboratories demonstrate that inflammation, specifically sustained pro-inflammatory
macrophage activation, contributes to age-related SCI deficits. In addition, it was recently discovered that the
efficacy of immunomodulatory SCI therapies is age-dependent. There is an urgent need to understand the
age-dependent mechanisms of sustained pro-inflammatory macrophage activation in SCI. The purpose of this
proposal is to investigate the role of macrophage bioenergetics in age-dependent inflammation and SCI
pathophysiology. The central hypothesis is that age-dependent impairments in macrophage metabolism drive
pro-inflammatory macrophage activation and contribute to secondary injury after SCI. The premise is that the
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) pathway is a key regulator of pro- or anti-inflammatory macrophage activation
as a connecting link between glycolysis (pro-inflammatory) or oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS, i.e. TCA or
Krebs cycle activity; anti-inflammatory). PDH kinase (PDK) regulates PDH thereby serving as the gatekeeper
for OXPHOS. The hypothesis to be tested is that PDK inhibition will drive metabolic processes (i.e. increased
OXPHOS) required for reparative macrophage activation and improved SCI recovery by PDK. Accordingly,
three independent Aims are designed to selectively target macrophage metabolism mechanistically, using
chimerization with PDK knockout mice, and therapeutically, using a newly generated liposomal drug
formulation of dichloroacetate (DCA), a PDK inhibitor. 4 and 14-month-old mice will undergo T9 contusion SCI
to model the current SCI demographic. Aim 1 will identify PDH as a bottleneck for SCI macrophage
metabolism using a newly optimized purification approach that allows for isolation of macrophages after SCI
and assessment of extracellular acidification (ECAR, i.e. glycolysis) and oxygen consumption (OCR, i.e.
OXPHOS) rates using the Seahorse bioanalyzer. Aim 2 will identify metabolic targets for macrophage
dysfunction after SCI using state-of-the-art techniques including single-cell RNA-sequencing and in vivo Stable
Isotope-Resolved Metabolomics to determine the metabolic profiles of resident microglia and peripherally
derived macrophages. Aim 3 will identify PDK inhibition as a therapeutic target to treat SCI through evaluation
of anatomic and functional recovery. Completion of the proposed work will identify ways to harness the
reparative functions of CNS macrophages and improve clinical practice by refining translational treatment
strategies including age as a potential influence in SCI treatment and recovery. Understanding the extent to
which metabolic activity regulates macrophage function will provide insight into age-dependent CNS
inflammation, thereby advancing the fields of neurotrauma, neuroscience, and aging. Macrophage metabolism
is a contributing factor in a host of inflammatory conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer,
etc., and the completion of the proposed aims will advance the study of human health on multiple fronts."
10805461,"ABSTRACT. The ongoing epidemic of suicide among former U.S. military personnel—17 deaths every day—
lies at the core of a 20-year trend of increasing suicide rates in the U.S. The rate of suicide in veterans is about
1.5 times that of the civilian population, due to veterans' unique burden of medical, psychological, and social-
environmental risk factors compounded by easy access to lethal means. To date, veteran suicide research and
prevention efforts have focused almost entirely on the population served by the Veterans Health Administration
(VHA). Meanwhile, most veterans do not seek VHA care but prefer private-sector health services. Since 2005,
suicides among veterans outside the reach of VHA have increased at more than double the rate seen among
VHA users (57% vs. 28%, respectively). This study's primary objective is to develop efficient longitudinal
predictive algorithms for suicide and firearm-related suicide among military veterans who utilized non-
VHA health care, by analyzing the largest database ever assembled of linked civilian medical record
data pertinent to veteran suicide risk. Too little is known about veterans receiving care outside the VHA,
including the nature and severity of their health conditions, their patterns of healthcare utilization, and their
unique risk factors for all suicide and firearm-related suicide. Filling these gaps in knowledge is crucial to the
goal of meaningfully reducing suicide in the veteran population overall. To that end, our multi-disciplinary team
of nationally distinguished researchers will assemble and analyze an unprecedented longitudinal database of
linked VA and Department of Defense data, health records, social indicators, and death records of veterans
receiving health care from 5 large civilian health systems in North Carolina and Utah. The database will yield
an estimated 3.8 million person-year observations, including approximately 900 firearm-involved suicides and
1,190 total suicide deaths. We will analyze these data to describe the demographic and health characteristics
of veterans who utilize non-VHA healthcare services, their patterns of healthcare utilization, their mortality
outcomes, and their incidence of suicide deaths, by method. We will use machine learning methods to develop
specific risk algorithms for predicting all suicides and firearm-related suicides among veterans who utilize non-
VHA healthcare, to identify veterans at elevated risk of suicide. Utah-based collaborators will use linked VHA
data to identify and describe risk patterns for veterans who combine VHA and non-VHA healthcare. Finally, we
will conduct a series of key informant interviews to better understand barriers and facilitators to integrating this
type of algorithm into civilian health system workflows. In summary, the proposed work will fill critical gaps in
the literature by leveraging large-scale, real-world data sources to yield novel knowledge of suicide risks, while
informing prevention efforts aimed at reducing veteran suicide. We will also gather implementation information
to inform how large civilian health systems will be able to use this information to identify and intervene with the
veterans who are at greatest risk of suicide within their patient populations."

 2 Project Title: Implementation of a Nationally Consistent Produce Safety Program in Washington State
 3 Project Description: Following Path C using our own state authority, the Washington State Department of
 4 Agriculture (WSDA) intends to further develop a sustainable infrastructure to maintain implementation of the
 5 Produce Safety Program (PSP) focused on and in alignment with the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA)
 6 Produce Safety Rule (PSR). WSDA will continue to assess the needs and opportunities related to the existing
 7 regulatory program and will develop a multi-year Project Plan with the following seven overarching goals:
 8 1. Conduct ongoing program assessments and planning that are essential to sustainable
 9 implementation of the PSP.
10 2. Maintain foundational resources necessary to implement a sustainable PSP.
11 3. Routinely provide education, outreach, and technical assistance opportunities to the Washington
12 produce industry.
13 4. Conduct ongoing quality control of farm inventory in order to maintain a complete and accurate
14 database of Washington produce farms.
15 5. Ensure PSP’s inspection regulatory program focuses on quality and national consistency.
16 6. Coordinate implementation of a quality compliance and enforcement program for the regulated
17 produce industry.
18 7. Strengthen PSP’s event response planning infrastructure to build upon existing systems for
19 detecting, investigating, mitigating, and analyzing produce-related outbreaks.
20 To achieve these goals, WSDA will continually assess and strategically plan for resources needed aimed at
21 maintenance of the existing regulatory program; perform ongoing quality control of produce inventory to assist
22 in long-term program planning; provide opportunities of evidence-based, nationally consistent training and
23 workshops for produce growers, Cooperative Extension, and other industry members on the PSR; and develop
24 a comprehensive compliance and enforcement program focused on quality and national consistency.
25 Expected Outcomes: Continued development of WSDA’s PSP will reduce public health risks for consumers
26 of Washington produce across the country and around the world. By utilizing both education and enforcement
27 to promote understanding of and compliance with the PSR, the PSP will encourage the safe
28 growing/harvesting/packing/holding of fruits and vegetables, significantly advance a national integrated food
29 safety system, and effectively fulfill the requirements of the Food Safety Modernization Act.

10857209,"In utero exposure to environmental chemicals can disturb neurobehavioral development in both animals and in
humans. The pathways linking in utero environmental exposures to neurobehavioral development likely involve
exposure-induced changes in the function of neural circuits that support cognitive control and reward
processes. We hypothesize that changes in the function of these circuits may act as a pathway between
environmental exposure and a range of maladaptive behaviors that commonly emerge in late childhood and
adolescence, a period that has been largely understudied with respect to the effects of prenatal exposures on
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Such behavioral symptoms include attention problems, substance abuse, and
psychotic experiences. This study will: 1) apply novel pattern recognition approaches to identify specific
exposure profiles of complex high-dimensional mixtures of prenatal chemical and social exposures and
examine how these profiles explain variation in risk for these behavioral symptoms in adolescence; 2) use task
and resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to identify how distinct exposure profiles affect circuits that support
cognitive control and reinforcement learning; and 3) explore if exposure-induced changes in brain activation
and connectivity mediate associations between prenatal exposure profiles and behavioral symptoms in
adolescence.
Impact: This R01 will integrate advanced pattern recognition methods, a cognitive neuroscience approach and
state-of-the-art fMRI techniques to explore brain pathways through which prenatal exposures alter behavior later
in adolescence. We will explore circuit-based changes in brain function that may mediate associations between
prenatal exposure profiles and symptoms of psychiatric disorders that typically emerge and co-occur in
adolescence. By simultaneously studying mixtures of chemical and social stressors as well as profiles of co-
occurring symptoms, we will greatly enhance our ability to comprehensively characterize the complex impacts
of prenatal environmental exposures on behavioral symptoms in adolescence. Our findings will allow public
health interventions to improve the quality of children's perinatal environment and the development of novel
circuit-specific intervention tools."
10875610,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In this proposal, we aim to engineer a biomaterial scaffold to accelerate diabetic wound closure by improving upon a
new sub-class of hydrogel biomaterials we have invented called Microporous Annealed Particle gel or MAP gel. MAP
gels are composed of microscopic spherical building blocks made using microfluidic generation and assembled in situ to
form a stable MAP scaffold. MAP scaffolds have been shown to improve tissue healing in both skin and brain through a
porosity-dependent reduction in wound inflammation and promotion of cell/tissue integration. We are focusing on
material improvements to counter three known difficulties for material-based treatment of diabetic wounds: abnormally
high immune activation, increased degradative microenvironment, and diminished new tissue generation. Specifically, we
have identified three MAP properties that we can independently modulate for scientific optimization: pore geometry
(known immunomodulatory parameter), degradability (premature material degradation results in loss of porous
geometry), and heterogeneous heparin “micro-islands” (a novel material strategy we have developed to improve intra-
scaffold angiogenesis). We hypothesize that investigating and optimizing each property individually will accelerate
diabetic wound closure and, finally, that the optimized properties can be combined synergistically.
 We will evaluate and optimize each material property using the following characterization workflow: in vitro property
quantification (property-dependent), in vitro cell response (survival, proliferation, and migration), in vivo immune
response (analysis by FACS), in vivo material degradation (analysis by histology), and in vivo tissue healing/regeneration
(analysis by immunohistology). Our studies focus on the diabetic wound environment through use of dermal cell lines in
vitro and a diabetic mouse (db/db) splinted wound healing model. Each Aim of our approach isolates an individual
material property to simplify the investigation. For example, pore geometry impact is investigated using a single hydrogel
formulation and hydrogel formulation impact uses a single pore geometry (constant formulation and pore geometry taken
from our successful non-diabetic studies). If successful, this project will provide a better understanding of tissue response
to a new class of biomaterial and produce an inexpensive and effective scaffold treatment option for accelerating diabetic
wound closure."
10766261,"Summary/Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 has caused the deaths of millions of people globally. Effective antiviral therapeutic
treatment options are urgently needed. CRISPR-mediated genome editing has provided a very promising avenue
for treatment of a variety of genetic diseases. Particularly, the CRISPR-Cas13 system has been demonstrated
to possess the potential of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections by degradation of viral genomic RNA
and viral mRNA. However, it is still very challenging to deliver the CRISPR machinery to initiate genome editing
efficiently in vivo. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain a variety of molecular components including lipids, mRNA,
microRNAs, and proteins. A large body of studies has shown that EVs mediate cell-to-cell communication by
transmitting their encapsulated contents. This proposal intends to construct EVs encapsulating the CRISPR
machinery and deliver the EVs to respiratory epithelial cells to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in vivo. We will
therefore genetically engineer the Cas13d protein so that Cas13d/CRISPR-RNA (crRNA) ribonucleoprotein
complex can be encapsulated into EVs. We will also engineer the membrane of EVs, such that EVs target
respiratory epithelial cells and deliver Cas13d/crRNA for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 viral assembly and proliferation,
thereby inhibiting COVID-19. This study will allow us to understand the feasibility of an EVs-based vehicle to
deliver genome editing machinery to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proliferation in lung epithelial cells. This study will
provide a treatment option for COVID-19 patients to reduce disease severity and mortality."
10892921,"ABSTRACT
Macromolecular interactions are often understood from the perspective of the bound state as
determined at high-resolution from x-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy with kinetic
and thermodynamic parameters used to describe the interaction process. This approach is,
however, limited spatially and temporally to a bulk, population level description of the process
from the perspective of affinity and kinetics, and the single state perspective of a bound state
structure. The process of forming an interaction is, in fact, quite complex, involving random
collisions between molecules that transition through a complicated set of pathways to the final
bound state. These collisions and the mechanism by which they achieve the bound state
determine the association rate but are not well defined by current methods. Here, a combined
computational and experimental approach to the interrogation of the process of antibody-
antigen binding in HIV-1 N332-glycan targeting broadly neutralizing antibodies is proposed to
enable precise enhancement of antibody-immunogen association rate kinetics. Using molecular
simulation, full encounter to bound state transition mechanisms will be elucidated at atomic
resolution. The goal of this effort is to enable precise selection of antigens with an affinity
gradient conducive to the consistent induction of broadly neutralizing antibody responses via
vaccination. The definition of design principles by which the kinetics of an interaction may be
manipulated in a protein engineering context will have a broad impact on the design of novel
therapeutics and macromolecular probes in any biological context."

partner with University of California, Irvine (UCI) to produce a seamless and supportive bridge for
underrepresented (UR) and underserved (US) students interested in biomedical research careers. Both
campuses are HSI and AANAPISI that normalize diversity and value inclusion along with providing rigorous
STEM training. Experiences at both institutions will support science identity and a sense of belonging, which
will remain with BTD trainees throughout their career. The BTD program will support ten talented UR/US
Master’s degree students from the CSULB Biological Sciences, Biochemistry and Chemistry graduate
programs. These students will complete graduate courses and defend an M.S. thesis with a two-year time line.
Faculty with strong records in publication and graduate training were selected as potential BTD research
mentors. The M.S. programs will be enhanced through a weekly Career Development Community, an annual
Career Panel and Enhancing Reproducibility workshop, and opportunities to present research at conferences.
BTD students will read literature about ethnicity and race in STEM to gain meta-cognition of science identity,
imposterism and the diversity-innovation paradox. A structured near-peer mentoring program will partner first
and second year BTD students to provide guidance and support to mentees and leadership experience for

Patients with bone dominant (BD) and bone only (BO) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) represent a large
patient population1,2 who are often excluded from clinical trials using RECIST 1.1 as the primary response
assessment because bone lesions are classified as non-measurable, non-target lesions3. Current blood-based
biomarkers such as tumor markers (CA15.3, CA27.29 and CEA) have similarly shown limited utility in
assessing response to therapy in patients with MBC. There is therefore an important need for better measures
of therapeutic response for patients with BD MBC. EA1183 FEATURE is a prospective, multicenter clinical trial
approved by the NCI and sponsored by ECOG-ACRIN designed to evaluate the value of serial FDG-PET/CT to
assess response in BD MBC. The trial will test the ability of tumor metabolic changes to predict the clinically
meaningful outcomes of progression free survival (PFS) and time to skeletal-related event (tSRE).
Measurement and characterization of ctDNA provides an option of non-invasively evaluating both disease
burden and emergence of genomic changes in tumor biology. We propose to integrate fluid-based tumor
monitoring (by serial collection of circulating tumor DNA, ctDNA) and FDG-PET/CT imaging to determine if
these biomarkers, separately or combined, can predict a response to therapy for in patients with BO or BD
MBC participating in the EA1183 FEATURE trial. We will also assess the extent to which FDG-PET/CT,
ctDNA, or both can predict PFS as early as 4 weeks into therapy. We hypothesize that integration of imaging
(FDG-PET/CT) and fluid-based, liquid biopsy (ctDNA) assays may permit characterization of therapy response
for patients with BO and BD MBC in advance of currently used methods, possibly as early as 4 weeks. This
R01 proposal will provide support for additional objectives in EA1183, which are the aims of our proposal: 1.) to
assess ability of qualitative and quantitative changes in serial ctDNA measures to predict PFS and time to SRE
in patients with BO or BD MBC beginning new systemic therapy in EA1183; 2) to determine if early metabolic
changes in bone metastases assessed by FDG-PET/CT at 4 weeks after start of systemic therapy predict PFS
and tSRE in patients with BO or BD MBC; 3) to evaluate the relationship between changes in ctDNA and
metabolic response as assessed by FDG-PET/CT and to test the combined ability of FDG-PET/CT and ctDNA
at 4 and 12 weeks after the start of new systemic therapy to predict PFS and SRE. The outcome of this study
will be the generation of robust response endpoints for BD MBC to provide access to clinical trials and guide
clinic al practice for the large group of patients with this type of MBC."

10900814,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer survivors are a growing population and their symptom burden is significant. Despite growing
evidence on specific symptoms and risk management strategies, efforts to translate knowledge into practice
have produced suboptimal results. Primary care is an ideal receptor site for breast cancer survivors, with
studies demonstrating the effectiveness of primary care based survivorship care. Nevertheless, over the past
decade, the emphasis on survivorship care plans and survivorship models has not had an evident impact on
primary care breast cancer survivorship care processes. Over the past two decades, primary care practices
have redesigned structures and care processes to deliver care to different complex populations; however,
breast cancer survivors are not among them. Many currently proposed and tested strategies are considered
oncology-centric and do not fit well within the real world contexts of primary care practices. Results from our
recent research studies indicate that breast cancer survivorship is not considered clinically actionable even
among primary care practices with advanced staffing models. Therefore, capacity building and stakeholder-
informed strategies are needed to enhance the translational potential of survivorship evidence into primary
care practices. This project uses a “designing for dissemination” perspective, blending the implementation
Exploration, Planning, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) framework and the primary care Practice
Change Model (PCM) as a theoretical basis for understanding multilevel factors impacting the implementation
of cancer survivorship guidelines in primary care. These perspectives help frame and identify mismatches
among existing policy, practice, provider, and patient motivators to translate the evidence into clinically
actionable primary care practice change strategies. Using a blended implementation/primary care practice
change conceptual framework, this project aims to: (1) engage diverse primary care stakeholders in identifying
actionable, practice-based activities for provision of long-term breast cancer survivorship care in primary care
using depth interviews; (2) prioritize, synthesize, and identify actionable activities for providing care to long-
term cancer survivors in primary care by engaging key stakeholders using modified online Delphi methods and
concept mapping; and (3) implement and evaluate actionable breast cancer survivorship symptom and risk
management activities using a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation cluster study design with waitlist
control in 26 primary care practices. Study results are poised to have profound impact on implementation
strategies used throughout the U.S. to provide long-term care for patients with a history of breast cancer."

10774329,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vertebrates evolved sophisticated immune systems to eliminate infections by helminth parasites
(tapeworms, nematodes). Nevertheless, helminths often succeed in establishing persistent infections
because they evolved strategies to evade or manipulate their host’s immune system. Because of this host-
parasite co-evolution, infection success is expected to depend on an epistatic interaction between host
immune genes and parasites’ immune-evasion genes. But, the immunogenetic mechanisms underlying
this between-species epistasis remains poorly understood, because most studies focus on immunological
effects of either host genes, or parasite genes, studied separately. Few experimental models of infection are
amenable to ‘reciprocal mapping’ – the concurrent genetic analysis of both interacting species. A small
fish, the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and its parasitic tapeworm (Schistocephalus
solidus), offer an experimentally tractable system for reciprocal genetic analysis of trans-
species epistasis between a vertebrate host and cestode parasite. Some natural populations of
stickleback evolved an aggressive inflammatory response to tapeworm infection that limits tapeworm
growth and survival, but results in severe and persistent fibrosis throughout the body cavity, a new model
for human Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis. Although an effective defense against infection, this fibrosis
is also pathological, limiting fish mobility and reproduction. To ameliorate this pathology, some
stickleback populations evolved a remarkable capacity to recover, partially reversing earlier fibrosis. Other
populations evolved a tolerance strategy, allowing tapeworm growth by suppressing fibrosis at the start of
infection; but these genotypes are unable to reverse fibrosis when it does occur. Aim 1 is to identify the
genetic basis of naturally-evolved variation among stickleback populations in the speed of fibrosis onset,
maximum severity, and reversal. We will achieve this using a triangulation approach merging QTL linkage
mapping, population genomics, and experimental evolution. CRISPR/cas9 editing will be used to confirm
the phenotypic effect of mapped genes. However, fibrosis is also a phenotypic outcome of heritable
differences between parasite populations. So, Aim 2 is to identify tapeworm genes that modulate the host
fibrosis response, using QTL mapping, population genomics and experimental gene editing. Aim 3
merges the results of Aims 1&2, to test for between-species epistatic interactions (synergy between host
and parasite genes) regulating onset, severity, and reversal of fibrosis. Ultimately, our goal is to identify
host and parasite genes that jointly determine infection success, and influence fibrosis severity or
suppression, to understand (i) mechanisms of immunity to peritoneal helminth infections, (ii) how the
cestode evolved to suppress or evade host immunity, and (iii) the genes underlying variation in onset,
severity, and recovery from fibrosis that is both immunologically adaptive but also pathological."
10832080,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Our pioneering research in adolescents and adults born preterm has identified 3 distinct characteristics of the
preterm heart that could increase risk for heart failure. These include (1) reduced cardiac size contributing to a
blunted cardiac reserve during exercise, (2) increased left ventricular (LV) cardiac fibrosis, and (3) right
ventricular (RV) dysfunction relative to the underlying pulmonary vascular disease, or impaired RV-pulmonary
vascular (PV) coupling. However, how these findings may progress across the early lifespan is unknown. The
objective of this proposal is (1) to develop cardiac growth and function curves using mixed effect quantile
regression models to predict cardiovascular trajectories in children and adults born preterm, and (2) to identify
risk factors and biomarkers for impaired growth and function. We propose cross-sectional repeated biventricular
and pulmonary vascular assessments obtained at baseline and repeated after 2 years in children and young
adults born <32 weeks preterm (age 8-30 years; n=150), compared to age-, sex-, and racially-matched term-
born controls (n=150). Multivariate models of the natural history of disease will be developed using mixed effect
quantile regression to predict growth and function trajectories. Aim 1: Identify novel characteristics that impair
cardiac growth from childhood through early adulthood after preterm birth. We will use repeated measures of
cardiac structure (e.g. LV end diastolic volume index and LV mass index by MRI) obtained at baseline and after
2 years. Multivariable models using mixed effect quantile regression will be used to develop cardiac growth
curves for each sex, adjusting for effects of neonatal and common cardiovascular health modifiers. We
hypothesize that preterm females will have a lower cardiac growth trajectory defined as growth at a consistent
but lower growth percentile, while preterm males will have a growth failure defined as a progressive fall from a
term growth curve. Aim 2: Determine whether biventricular cardiac fibrosis is associated with neonatal
characteristics and progressive with chronological age after preterm birth. Using cardiac MRI with late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) and native T1 mapping, we will assess biventricular cardiac fibrosis. We hypothesize that
fibrosis scores are elevated in preterm-born children and adults, associate with neonatal resuscitation, and
progress with age. Aim 3: Assess whether RV-PV coupling declines with age due to worsening RV function. We
will use serial noninvasive measures of RV-PV coupling (MRI RV stroke volume/end systolic volume), RV
function (MRI ejection fraction, strain), and pulmonary vascular disease (ECHO tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity,
pulmonary artery acceleration time, and pulmonary vascularization) to establish the trajectories of RV and PV
disease after preterm birth. We hypothesize that preterm-born individuals demonstrate worsening RV-PV
coupling with age due to worsening RV function rather than rising afterload (worsening PV disease), most notable
in males and those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Study results will provide justification and potential targets
for future early intervention studies to promote cardiac growth and preserve cardiac function after preterm birth."
10830477,"Obesity causes chronic “sterile” inflammation, which is implicated in insulin resistance and
other metabolic complications. NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3) is an intracellular
sensor for various “danger” signals from microbial infection and metabolic stress. Activation of
NLRP3 inflammasomes elicits host defense responses by promoting caspase 1-dependent
release of IL-1β and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Intriguingly, activation of NLRP3
inflammasomes is also implicated in “sterile” inflammation and insulin resistance in diet-induced
obesity (DIO), yet the “danger” signals that lead to NLRP3 activation in obesity remains elusive.
Prions are misfolded proteins that are capable of self-transmitting their misfolded shape onto
normal variants of the same protein. Recent progress in the field has identified more than 240
non-infectious prion-like proteins in mammals. Although a few of these proteins are well implicated
in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, surprisingly little information is known about
majority of the prion-like proteins’ potential involvement in human health and disease. Here, we
propose to investigate a novel pathway by which a putative prion-like protein regulates NLRP3
activation in DIO. This pathway is mediated by the ALCAT1 enzyme, the first acyl-CoA dependent
lysocardiolipin acyltransferase previously identified by us. Our groundbreaking work in the field
shows that ALCAT1 promotes the development of age-related metabolic diseases by catalyzing
pathological remodeling of cardiolipin (CL) with very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, such
as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Enrichment of DHA renders CL highly sensitive to oxidative
damage (CL-Ox) by reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to CL depletion and mitochondrial
dysfunction in metabolic diseases. Remarkably, our preliminary studies also identified a pivotal
role of ALCAT1 in linking DIO to NLRP3 activation as a putative prion-like protein, including 1)
ALCAT1 forms prion-like protein aggregates in response to oxidative stress, which is mediated
by a prion-like domain at the N-terminus; 2) ALCAT1 expression in adipose tissue is dramatically
upregulated by DIO; and 3)Targeted deletion of ALCAT1 in adipocytes significantly attenuates
NLRP3 activation by preventing macrophage infiltration in white adipose tissue. Together, these
exciting findings let us to hypothesize that ALCAT1 promotes NLRP3 activation in DIO as a
putative prion-like protein, which will be tested by three Specific Aims: AIM 1 will determine
whether ALCAT1 promotes NLRP3 activation through mitochondrial dysfunction; AIM 2 will
identify molecular mechanisms by which ALCAT1 promotes NLRP3 activation as a prion-like
protein; and AIM 3 will assess whether ALCAT1 links cellular senescence in adipose tissue to
chronic inflammation in DIO mice. Successful completion of the proposed studies will not only
validate ALCAT1 as a novel drug target of chronic inflammation, but also provide proof of concept
studies of targeting the enzyme for the treatment of obesity and its related complications."
10894696,"Abstract
 The main goal of this project is to determine the contribution of human microglia in the establishment of
early neural networks during development in healthy and autistic conditions. Although the exact cause of
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) remains unclear, epigenetic, genetic and environmental factors are at play.
Given that ASD is a complex multifactorial disorder and that epigenetic modifications have been shown to
control microglial phenotypes/plasticity, we hypothesized that microglial epigenetic signature might influence
neuronal development. Given that microglia originate in the periphery and later invade the brain, they are most
likely the first brain cell type to be exposed to an environmental factor or at least be impacted by the
environmental factor given their role as gate keepers of the brain. Therefore, a better understanding of the
genetic, environmental or a synergistic impact of both, will pave the way to a better understanding of human
neurodevelopment and human microglial roles during this process yielding to the discovery of novel
therapeutic targets and efficient therapies for a broad range of neurological disorders including ASD. Thus,
with this project, we aim to establish whether and how human microglia interfere with neural network
establishment and if high-risk ASD epigenetic genes could alter their function and their role during human
neurodevelopment. Based on our preliminary data we propose the following specific aims are: Aim 1:
Determine the role of healthy human microglia on healthy brain cortical organoids (BCO), Aim 2:
Measure the impact of microglia carrying ASD mutations on BCO development and function, and Aim
3: Impact of environmental ASD-risk factors in combination with underlying genetic predisposition: the
two-hit hypothesis. Here we will test the isolated and additive effect of ASD-related environmental factors on
the function of microglia and its impact on BCO physiology."
10792921,"Sepsis is a life-threatening illness due to the human body’s extreme inflammatory response to infection. There
are >1.5 million cases of sepsis and >250,000 sepsis-related deaths each year in the United States. However,
there are no effective therapies. Hyperactive inflammasomes are involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis and
could be therapeutically targeted to save lives. Inflammasomes are large cytosolic multiprotein complexes
formed in response to infections and cellular stresses that drive auto-activation of inflammatory caspases
(Caspase-1, -4, -5), production of inflammatory mediators [interleukin (IL) -1 and -18)], and pyroptosis, a form of
cell death. Canonical inflammasomes are assembled by a pattern recognition receptor (PRR), an adaptor ASC
(optional) and Caspase-1. Non-canonical inflammasomes are activated by direct binding of a bacterial endotoxin
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to Caspase-4/5 (mouse Caspase-11), which oligomerizes and cleaves Gasdermin D
(GSDMD). Active GSDMD induces pore formation in the plasma membrane and cell death. Although much has
been learned about the regulatory mechanisms for canonical inflammasomes, little is known for non-canonical
inflammasomes. To address this gap, we recently identified an ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain-containing
protein 1 (UBXN1) involved in non-canonical inflammasome-mediated sepsis, and believe that validating its role
in this process will reveal new treatment strategies. To begin uncovering its function, we generated the first
inducible global Ubxn1 knockout mouse model—a critical tool, as early global knockout is embryonically lethal.
Using this model, we found that Ubxn1-/- mice were highly resistant to lethal LPS endotoxemia and cecal-
ligation-and-puncture (CLP)-elicited polymicrobial sepsis, compared to sex- and age-matched Ubxn1+/+
littermates. Accordingly, the levels of IL-1, IL-18, and GSDMD/Caspase-11 activation were reduced in Ubxn1-/-
mice. Of note, GSDMD and Caspase-11 activation in response to LPS was reduced in primary Ubxn1-/-
macrophages as well. This UBXN1 function is conserved in human cells. Both Caspase-4/GSDMD activation
and pyroptosis were impaired in IFN-γ-primed, LPS-transfected UBXN1-/- HeLa cells. Moreover, UBXN1
interacted with LPS and Caspase-4. These results support our hypothesis that UBXN1 positively regulates non-
canonical inflammasome signaling and thus contributes to sepsis pathogenesis. We will prove this by pinpointing
the molecular mechanism of UBXN1 action on the Caspase-4/11-LPS, and by characterizing the physiological
role of UBXN1 in CLP sepsis.
 UBXN1 protein is highly conserved between rodents and humans (93% identical), so is its function in
inflammasome signaling. By using the CLP method, our studies should provide pre-clinical evidence relevant
to human sepsis. Successful completion of this R21 will lay a solid foundation for more in-depth mechanistic
and functional studies in a future R01 application."
10799715,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic heightened awareness of health disparities and related social determinants (SDs)
globally, as well as inequalities in countries’ capacities to study and address such disparities and their SDs.
This is especially relevant to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which account for >70% of deaths annually
and disproportionately impact low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Armenia (AM) faces particular NCD-
related challenges; NCDs account for 93% of all deaths and the top 10 causes of death, premature death, and
disability. Critical to decreasing NCD burden is reducing modifiable NCD risk factors (e.g., tobacco/alcohol use,
unhealthy diet); this is particularly important in AM. AM has the 11th highest male smoking rate globally (52%),
ranks in the top 40% of countries in alcoholism rates, and has a 48% prevalence of overweight/obesity. SDs
(e.g., healthcare, social context) impact both modifiable NCD risk factors and NCD outcomes, and play a
crucial role in NCD-related health disparities in AM. We propose the Armenia-US Collaboration to Address
Chronic Disease via Education in Social Determinants Science (ACCESS) program, in response to PAR-
21-230. Its overall goal is to reduce the NCD burden in AM by enhancing research capacity related to NCD
prevention and control, emphasizing SDs of NCD risk factors as key components. ACCESS is a strategic
collaboration between George Washington University (GW) and American University of Armenia (AUA),
alongside AM’s Ministry of Health (MOH) and its entities (e.g., NIH). Leveraging our team’s substantial ongoing
collaborations, ACCESS will be an effective, sustainable program that enhances research infrastructure,
training, and research opportunities related to NCD prevention and control for junior researchers. In Aim 1, we
will develop a formal NCD prevention and control research training program (emphasizing SDs of NCD risk
factors) and related institutional infrastructure. We will offer specialized training to: a) long-term MPH trainees
who already hold an MD or related doctoral degree in order to develop future NCD research leaders; and b)
short-term trainees (e.g., public health/clinical students/professionals) to enhance core NCD research skills. In
Aim 2, we will advance AM’s national NCD research agenda via mentored research focused on SDs of NCD
risk factors among future NCD research leaders (i.e., long-term trainees). In Aim 3, we will catalyze NCD-
related research dissemination and knowledge translation to inform policy and practice, by enhancing related
skills and leveraging the engagement of the MOH and its entities. ACCESS will be the 1st program of its kind in
AM and will address AM’s national health priorities. We will establish future NCD prevention and control
leaders and an educational core for the broader community of public health and clinical professionals in AM.
Our team is uniquely-suited to establish ACCESS, enhance NCD research capacity in AM in the next 5 years,
and sustain and expand it in scope and scale in the long-term to optimize its impact on global NCD burden."
10820502,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among women in the United States. Women
who experience hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDP), including chronic hypertension, gestational
hypertension, and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, face substantially higher future CVD risk. About one in seven
women experience HDP by the end of their childbearing years, with higher rates among women of color.
Transitioning to primary care postpartum is recommended for all women, but has particular urgency for women
with HDP. Women with HDP have a high risk of adverse outcomes in the immediate postpartum period (e.g.
maternal morbidity and mortality), one to three years postpartum (e.g., hypertension, metabolic syndrome
onset), and long-term (e.g. ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke). The limited existing research on
postpartum primary care utilization shows that up to 80% of women who experienced HDP do not receive
primary care in the year following birth. Primary care is an appropriate setting for short and long-term CVD risk
management, including identification and treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, little is
known about the primary care provided for postpartum women with HDP and whether it responds to their
heightened CVD risk. Despite low rates of postpartum transition to primary care for women with HDP, little is
known about how systems factors impact this transition and primary care CVD risk assessment and
management in the postpartum year. Using an explanatory-sequential mixed methods design, we examine the
postpartum transition to primary care for CVD risk management for women with HDP in Massachusetts and
nationally. These aims address NHLBI’s strategic objective to “investigate factors that account for differences
in health among populations,” which includes managing cardiometabolic risk to improve health trajectories in
sex-specific populations. The specific aims are 1) To determine the role of systems factors in the transition to
preventive primary care for women with HDP in the postpartum year; 2) To characterize and examine clinician
and organizational factors influencing cardiometabolic risk assessment and management in primary care in the
postpartum year; and 3) To identify organizational and contextual factors shaping the postpartum transition to
primary care and CVD risk management in primary care. With input from a multi-stakeholder advisory board,
we will integrate results across aims to develop practice and policy recommendations to improve care quality
for women with HDP to reduce future CVD risk. Results from this study will contribute to an improved
understanding of systems factors associated with successful transition to postpartum primary care for women
at high CVD risk, and help to identify interventions, healthcare quality metrics, and policy levers to improve
clinical practice."
10877133,"Project Summary
Clinician scientists in infectious diseases must serve as leaders in the development of new strategies to
effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat infection. This requires clinicians to build upon scientific advancements
from varied disciplines through collaboration with basic scientists, clinical investigators, and translational
researchers whose work is “bench to bedside.”
Given the current nature of post-doctoral MD research training, relatively few physicians have the
interdisciplinary clinical and research training needed to conduct high quality research that address infectious
diseases. Also, with the global burden of infectious disease, clinical researchers who are able to conduct basic
science, clinical investigation and translational research on both the domestic and an international level is
imperative.
The ultimate goals of this research training program is to develop academic leaders in infectious diseases by
1) providing a dynamic, highly collaborative training environment with outstanding research opportunities,
particularly for those interested in international ID; 2) providing a structured supportive training process that
consistently trains research-naïve physicians producing productive physician-investigators who have
successfully competed for extramural funds after program graduation; and 3) promoting the academic success
of physician-investigators from underrepresented groups and women, critical for the future creditability of
academic medicine. We propose to achieve this goal by providing two years of integrated research experience
and coursework to post-doctoral fellows in Adult Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.
The Johns Hopkins University is uniquely qualified to develop and maintain such a program given the on-going
research of our faculty, the successful outcomes of our previous trainees, the resources available, and the
continuous influx of bright dedicated infectious diseases physicians. The proposed training program will be
unique at Johns Hopkins University because of its emphasis on the development of successful leaders in
infectious diseases research."
10890659,"In this renewal, we will continue our studies of the causes and disease consequences of human
genetic variation. We have generated whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from the three-generation
Utah CEPH pedigrees to longitudinally characterize rates and patterns of de novo mutations (DNMs). We
showed significant differences in the rates of accumulation of mutations among families, and we
demonstrated that 10% of apparent DNMs are actually postzygotic events that result in mosaicism. We
also showed that a higher rate of age-adjusted germline DNM transmission is significantly associated with
a shorter lifespan and earlier menopause. These results imply that one’s germline DNM rate, which
increases with age, is associated with the somatic mutation rate. In the next funding period, we will test
this hypothesis directly using blood-derived DNA samples collected at three different time points in the
same CEPH pedigree members over a 35-year time period. To our knowledge, this is the first long-term
longitudinal study of germline and somatic mutation rates in human pedigrees. We also hypothesize that
DNA repair mechanisms influence variation in both germline and somatic mutation rates. We will test
this hypothesis using whole-genome sequence data (supported by separate funding) and RNA-seq data
from freshly collected whole blood samples. We predict that lower expression of critical DNA repair
genes will result in higher germline and somatic mutation rates.
 To increase our power to detect patterns and disease associations, we will (under separate
funding) expand the CEPH pedigree collection to include more than 700 members of the fourth
generation, who are now adults. We will also resample generations 2 and 3 for a third time. We will
undertake WGS and RNA-seq in these study participants, creating a unique, publicly available repository
of genetic information spanning four generations. More than 180 phenotypic measurements were made
for generations 2 and 3 of the CEPH pedigrees 20 years ago, and the same measurements will be made for
generation 4. These resources will allow us to explore the effects of genetic variation, including mutation
rates and DNA repair, on a broad assortment of phenotypes across several generations.
 In addition, we will continue our work to develop new and improved methods for genome
sequence analysis, including the detection of mobile element insertions. We will analyze WGS and
RNA-seq data from members of large Utah disease pedigrees obtained from the Utah Population
Database, focusing on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. These projects
involve analysis of WGS and RNA-seq data as well as functional analysis in in vitro and in vivo systems."

With the fast advances in technology in the last decade enabling the rapid accumulation of large quantities of
data relevant to biomedical research, there is an urgent need to train the next generation of scientists with skills
to correctly analyze and interpret these data while working closely in collaborative environments with other
scientists. The Interdisciplinary Training Program for Biostatisticians provides critical training to build the next
generation of leaders in biostatistics, who will guide the design of data collection, analysis of data, and
interpretation and dissemination of the results. There is a need for biostatisticians who are not only strong
methodologists, but also excellent communicators who are comfortable working in multidisciplinary settings. This
training program provides strong training in interdisciplinary research, reproducibility methods, and the
responsible conduct or research while supporting students in their professional and career development.
Our training objectives are: A) to appoint four new and reappoint four current trainees with diverse backgrounds
per year to a program that integrates rigorous theoretical statistical training with research experience in
bioinformatics, genetics, observational studies and clinical trials, as well as additional training in biology and in
reproducible, responsible and ethical conduct of research; B) to achieve a > 90% graduation rate within 5-6 years
from the start of the PhD program among trainees; C) to maintain a program that produces biostatisticians trained
in both standard biostatistical methods and emerging methodologies in biomedical research but also with applied
research experience in an interdisciplinary working environment; D) to prepare biostatisticians who graduate
from the program for competitive careers in academia, industry, and government via a curriculum that includes
opportunities for a strong record of scientific publications, presentations at conferences, and experience in
interdisciplinary collaborations, and teaching. The program seeks to recruit a diverse group of trainees and to
provide a supportive environment where all trainees can thrive and succeed. This is done by creating a strong
community, providing multiple mentors, and seeking regular feedback from trainees to identify opportunities to
improve the program. Through mentored research rotations in multiple areas of biostatistical application,
trainees receive hands-on experience in working in multidisciplinary teams performing research. They also
receive formal training and mentorship in reproducible methods for conducting research and responsible conduct
of research. This provides trainees with a breadth of exposure that is critical to prepare them to be leaders in
biostatistics, a field that is highly collaborative and requires mastery of a wide range of areas of application and
statistical methodologies. Trainees receive thorough career and professional development training. Regular
feedback and evaluation of the program ensures that trainees are receiving excellent mentorship and that
mentors receive feedback and opportunities to receive additional training. Trainees are encouraged to develop
their own training plan and learn to become more autonomous throughout the program."

Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common primary tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) in adults. Despite
aggressive surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, median survival is only 15-20 months. In GB tumors,
approximately 30-50% of the cells in the tumor are innate myeloid immune cells, primarily macrophages (MP)
and microglia (MG). Research in the Tsirka laboratory has shown that MP and MG enhance GB growth by
promoting angiogenesis and fostering an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), partly through
the action of the co-receptor Neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Our recent work has suggested distinct roles for MG and MP
in glioma. Expression of NRP1 on glioma-associated MP and MG (GAM) is critical for their oncogenic activity.
Deletion of NRP1 from myeloid cells blunts angiogenesis and results in decreased GB volume. Prior research
has shown that hypoxic glioma cells upregulate stem cell-associated genes and function as glioma stem cells
(GSC), which are thought to drive the immunosuppressive and angiogenic nature of GAM. NRP1 has been
shown to be critical for the GAM responses to hypoxia. The long-term goal of our research group is to define the
TME roles of MG and MP as well as methods through which MP and MG can be repolarized to exert anti-
tumorigenic effects rather than facilitate tumor growth. The overall objective of my proposal is to determine the
mechanisms by which MG and MP interact with hypoxic regions and GSC to exert oncogenic effects. I
hypothesize that NRP1 activation on myeloid cells is an important mediator for pro-tumorigenic signaling
between hypoxic glioma cells, GSC and GAM. To test this hypothesis, I will pursue two specific aims: 1)
Determine the NRP1 pathways activated in GAM by hypoxic glioma cells; and 2) identify how GAM-NRP1
signaling affects the interaction between GSC and GAM. For the first aim, MP and MG will be separately treated
with media from glioma cells cultured in normoxia or hypoxia, with or without a NRP1 inhibitor, and assessed for
differences in the expression of pro/anti-inflammatory and angiogenesis factors identified through
phosphoproteomics. Using immunocompetent mouse models of GB, I will investigate how GAM-NRP1 affects
GAM phenotypes and tumor cell proliferation in normoxic and hypoxic tumor regions. In the second aim, the
contribution of GAM-NRP1 to GSC/GAM interactions will be interrogated in culture and in vivo. The proposed
research is expected to be significant because it will determine roles for MP and MG behavior in the context of
hypoxic areas of glioma and further explore the interaction between GSC and GAM. It will also help determine
whether modulation of NRP1 is a viable method for promoting anti-tumorigenic outputs for GAM."

Futuros Fuertes 2.0: A primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in low-income Latino children
 Latino children are at higher risk of obesity and obesity sequelae relative to non-Hispanic white
children. Poverty also increases obesity risk. Disparities in obesity for Latino children emerge in early
childhood; and feeding and sedentary behaviors that increase obesity risk begin in the first two years of life.
Consequently, it is critical to develop and test interventions to prevent obesity among low-income Latino
children beginning in infancy. Primary care provides an ideal setting for obesity prevention among infants and
toddlers given frequent visits in the first two years of life. Incorporating culturally concordant lay health
educators into primary care settings serving diverse, low-income populations is a strategic approach for
leveraging primary care visits to promote healthy behaviors. Furthermore, the use of text messages is a
promising strategy for extending the reach of primary care-based interventions and engaging family members
who do not attend in-person visits. Our team developed and successfully pilot tested Futuros Fuertes 1.0
(Strong Futures), a culturally tailored, primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in Latino infants and
toddlers. A pilot trial of Futuros Fuertes 1.0 found impact on child health behaviors and BMI z-score and
informed modifications and enhancements leading to Futuros Fuertes 2.0.
 Parents/caregivers receive Futuros Fuertes 2.0 intervention content through: health education and
coaching sessions from a lay health educator, two text messages per week, and environmental prompts. Text
messages are also sent to up to 2 additional family members. Through Futuros Fuertes 2.0, parents are
coached on responsive feeding techniques, foods and beverages that are healthy for their child and those to
avoid, screen time guidelines, and strategies to enhance sleep duration. Our central hypothesis is that a
culturally tailored, primary care-based intervention for low-income Latino parents/caregivers delivered via
health education and coaching sessions in the infant and toddler period and reinforced through text messages
to multiple family caregivers will result in lower BMI at age 2. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of Futuros
Fuertes 2.0 on children’s BMI and on feeding, screen time and sleep. Low-income Latino infant-
parent/caregiver dyads (n=576) will be recruited from birth to 1 month at two health centers in Northern
California and randomized to: Futuros Fuertes 2.0 or a control intervention. In Aim 2, we will assess mediators
and moderators of intervention effect. In Aim 3, we will use a qualitative approach (semi-structured interviews)
to understand parent and provider experiences with the Futuros Fuertes 2.0 intervention. The Futuros Fuertes
2.0 model may improve feeding, screen time and sleep behaviors among low-income Latino children and
therefore has the potential for lowering their lifetime risk of obesity and metabolic complications."

 American Indians (AIs) have a lower life expectancy by 5.5 years less compared to all
other U.S. races. Cardiovascular disease prevalence has been increasing among AIs and serves
as the leading cause of mortality among AIs. Trauma confers risk for poor cardiovascular health.
AIs have disproportionately higher incidence of childhood trauma compared to other racial and
ethnic groups. Additionally, AIs deal with the ongoing implications from historical trauma,
which is the emotional and psychological wounding associated with the loss of land, language,
and cultural traditions. It remains possible that both childhood and historical traumas may
contribute to persisting AI health disparities. The relationship between trauma and health in
other racial and ethnic groups has been studied for many years, and research indicates
differences in physiological responses to acute stress may contribute to the negative effects of
trauma on health. To date, the relationship between trauma and markers of risk for
cardiometabolic disease and poor mental health, and the role of physiological responses to
stress in this relationship, have not been studied in an exclusively AI community.
 To address this critical research gap, the present study will elucidate relationships
between trauma and health in the Blackfeet community in Montana. The life expectancy for
members of the Blackfeet is 13 years less than the life expectancy of non-Hispanic Whites living
in the same county, in part due to the disproportionality high incidence of cardiometabolic
disease and mental health conditions in the community which suffers from both high rates of
trauma.
 A sample of AI adults (N=400, 50% female, age range: 18-25 years) residing on the same
reservation will participate in a cross-sectional study. Participants will report childhood and
historical trauma, alcohol use, and depressive and anxiety symptomology and will complete two
in-person visits. During Visit 1, participants will have their resting blood pressure assessed,
waist circumference measured, and blood samples taken for biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk.
During Visit 2, participants will have arterial stiffness measured and complete a validated acute
psychological laboratory paradigm. Participants will have cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and
inflammatory responses to the acute stress measured. The findings will ultimately inform future
intervention efforts and provide the basis for longitudinal work to capture trajectories of
cardiometabolic and mental health in the context of past and ongoing trauma."

Human babesiosis caused by the hemoparasite Babesia microti is an emerging tick-borne disease in the
United States. Symptoms include fever, chills, sweats, headache, myalgia and anorexia. In young and healthy
individuals, symptoms tend to be few and mild. In individuals >50 years of age and in immunocompromised
patients, symptoms can be severe and hospital admission required. Despite medical care, complications such
as severe anemia, adult respiratory distress syndrome and renal insufficiency or failure can develop. Death is
the outcome in 2-3% of hospitalized cases. Prophylaxis is limited to endemic area avoidance and tick exposure
reduction. These measures have been ineffective in curtailing the emergence of babesiosis. No vaccine is
available and no chemoprophylaxis has been tested for babesiosis. Tafenoquine is approved for pre-exposure
prophylaxis of malaria and radical cure of Plasmodium vivax infection. The prophylactic regimen consists of a
loading dose taken for three consecutive days followed by a weekly maintenance dose until one week after
travel. The therapeutic regimen is a single dose taken along with chloroquine. Tafenoquine has never been
tested as prophylaxis for babesiosis. Pre-clinical studies indicate that i) prompt resolution of B. microti infection
is achieved by single dose tafenoquine but ii) radical cure is attained only if tafenoquine is administered over
several consecutive days. In a recent case report, we were the first to document the therapeutic benefit of
tafenoquine in an elderly immunocompromised patient who suffered from relapsing babesiosis in the context of
broad antimicrobial resistance. Cure was achieved following initiation of tafenoquine. We hypothesize that
tafenoquine can be used for the prophylaxis of babesiosis, including when the host immune response is
weakened by advanced age or severe immune suppression. In Aim #1, we will use the DBA/2J mouse strain to
model the severe babesiosis of old age. We will initiate our studies by infecting young DBA/2J mice and, in
doing so, identify regimens that offer a prospect of conferring prophylaxis in old age. Briefly, we will administer
tafenoquine for three consecutive days during the “window period”, starting on day 3 post-infection. We will
monitor the course of parasitemia from its onset (day 7) until day 35 post-infection. We will ascertain whether
radical cure is achieved by adoptive transfer of blood to rag-deficient mice. We identify the protective regimen
that uses the lowest daily dose and test whether this regimen confers prophylaxis to old DBA/2J mice. We will
detect tafenoquine in plasma by use of LC/MS/MS and identify the maximal concentration and the overall drug
exposure required for prophylaxis in young and old DBA/2J mice. In Aim #2, we will use young rag-deficient
BALB/c mice to model severe immune suppression. We will test whether prophylaxis of rag-deficient mice
requires a daily dose higher than those used for prophylaxis of young and old DBA/2J mice. If successful, the
work will lay the ground for a clinical trial that will test tafenoquine for post-exposure prophylaxis of babesiosis."
10833679,"Project Summary
 Reactivation of HSV in latently infected sensory neurons is of considerable clinical importance
especially with respect to eye disease. Development of effective alternative strategies to limit reactivation has
been limited by an insufficient understanding of mechanisms that regulate intermittent reversion from the latent
to the infectious state. HSV latency associated transcript (LAT) plays a critical role in latency-reactivation and
is the only viral transcript detected at high levels in infected sensory neurons of humans, mice, and rabbits.
Because the viral genome, but no detectable infectious virus, is present in latent HSV infection, it is clear that
the viral genome is not fully quiescent in latently infected cells. Our previous studies, and those published in
the current funding period, established an important link between gD expression and the ability of LAT to
enhance herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) expression in TG of latently infected mice. Our findings suggest
a novel model, in which gD expression and LAT enhanced upregulation of HVEM expression contribute to HSV
reactivation in TG of latently infected mice. In this proposal, we hypothesize that low level gD expression
and its binding to HVEM contribute to ocular HSV reactivation. Our progress during the current funding
period has provided novel insights into potential mechanisms by which LAT regulation of HVEM expression
defines the extent of latency-reactivation and eye disease. Based on our data, we have formulated a bimodal
model in which the increased reactivation effects of sncRNA1&2 during latency are mediated by two different,
but inter-related, mechanisms: (i) sncRNA1&2 binding to the HVEM promoter leads to higher levels of HVEM
expression; and (ii) higher expression of HVEM enhances gD binding to HVEM and increases reactivation. We
will test our model using clinically relevant recombinant viruses in mouse models that control for the complexity
of the latent microenvironment in TG and its potential relationships with the primary infection as follows: (1)
Determine whether sncRNA1&2 are both required to upregulate HVEM and increase reactivation from
latency; and (2) Determine whether gD expression during latency and its binding to HVEM is required
for efficient reactivation from latency in TG of latently infected mice. Validation of this hypothetical model
will identify previously undescribed mechanisms that contribute to HSV-1 reactivation and will provide the
framework for identification of molecular targets and viral immune evasion response that could be exploited to
better manage latent HSV infection.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND"
10851741,"Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease manifesting with severe inflammation and loss of function
of lacrimal (LG) and/or salivary (SG) glands, leading to severe dry eye and dry mouth. SS patients also exhibit
extraglandular systemic symptoms including development of autoantibodies, inflammation of visceral organs and
increased risk of B-cell lymphoma. Pathogenesis is complex and involves interplay between the activated
immune system and exocrine epithelia; thus, SS therapies should ideally achieve both local glandular and
systemic immunomodulation to fully treat the disease. Our initial focus is developing an effective treatment
regimen for SS-associated dry eye disease (DED) and systemic symptoms, using the male NOD mouse which
exhibits these disease manifestations of SS. We later explore efficacy in a model of autoimmune sialoadenitis
and systemic symptoms, the female NOR mouse. Topical treatments are currently used clinically to manage
symptoms of SS-associated DED, but these approaches are insufficient to suppress LG inflammation. Systemic
symptoms are also treated to limited success with general immunomodulatory agents which also lack sufficient
bioavailability to treat glandular inflammation. We hypothesize and test that a combined approach of
optimized local glandular plus systemic delivery of therapeutics is necessary to effectively treat both
glandular and extraglandular symptoms of SS. To achieve this, we use a versatile protein-polymer platform
comprised of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) that can be genetically fused to peptides/proteins in ways that
optimize their pharmacokinetics and bioactivity. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1. Local LG
immunosuppression using Supra-LG Rapa ELP depots and Molecular targeting to ICAM-1. The
immunosuppressant, Rapamycin (Rapa), will be complexed to a depot-forming FKBP12-ELP fusion protein that
sequesters Rapa; this carrier will be further modified to target intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)
increased in diseased LG in SS. In male NOD mice, efficacy will be assessed when delivered supra-LG towards
SS-associated DED and systemic disease. Aim 2. Th17 immunosuppression using systemic delivery of
extracellular IL-17 receptor ELPs. Elevated IL-17A is linked to SS pathogenesis. We develop soluble and
depot-ELP fusions expressing the extracellular domain of the IL-17 receptor (eIL17R) to form multivalent IL-17A-
sequestering nanoparticles for systemic delivery using subcutaneous (SC, flank) administration. In male NOD
mice, efficacy will be assessed in SS-associated DED and systemic symptoms. Aim 3: Efficacy of local and
systemic combination therapies in glandular and extraglandular symptoms of SS. Efficacy of combination
local + systemic treatments will be assessed using formulations delivered by supra-LG (5FV-Rapa) and SC
(soluble eIL17R-A192). Efficacy will be assessed both in male NOD mice (autoimmune dacryoadenitis/systemic
symptoms) and in female NOR mice (autoimmune sialoadenitis/systemic symptoms)."

Neuronal signaling events at synapses determine circuit responses and result in specific behavioral outputs.
This signaling is dynamic - modulated by the history of synaptic activity and perceived stimuli. Defects in
neurotransmission also play a causative role in neurological disorders. However, our understanding of this
process is limited by two factors: size and speed. Over the years, we have developed several techniques in
electron microscopy to visualize changes in protein localization and synaptic ultrastructure associated with
neuronal activity with millisecond temporal precision. Our experiments have revealed key insights into
mechanisms of the synaptic vesicle cycle as well as new parameters controlling synaptic plasticity. However,
many mysteries remain. How do exocytic and endocytic proteins coordinate to mediate membrane remodeling
at synapses on a millisecond time scale? How do these proteins interact with each other and membrane lipids
to perform their functions? How heterogenous are these processes? To address these questions, we will
develop novel approaches in electron microscopy and leverage these tools to dissect the molecular
mechanisms underlying synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis."
10813082,"K+ channel structural dynamics landscape: from selectivity to gating
The chemical and electrical activities that make life possible are controlled by a constellation of ion channels. These are transmembrane proteins that regulate the differential concentration of ions across the cell membrane, with, in the case of K+ channels, the extraordinary ability to differentiate between extremely similar ions such as Na+ and K+. Although ion selectivity and gating mechanisms have been studied for many years, the underlying structural temporal dynamics remain poorly understood. Using techniques such as single molecule FRET (smFRET) or fluorescent non-canonical amino acids incorporation, it is possible to assess ion channel intramolecular movements and states in real time. In this project, I intend to incorporate a wide range of techniques, from electrophysiology to single molecule approaches to delineate the real-time dynamics of K+ channels in synthetic and live cell membranes. By combining my prior experience in ion channel biophysics and electrophysiology, along with establishing new approaches and training in relevant techniques, including smFRET, hyperspectral imaging, structure determination and Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations, I propose two specific aims to address the unifying question: What are the structural dynamics of ion selectivity and gating in K+ channels? These studies will, first, test the hypothesis that the potassium channel selectivity filter (SF) with sequence TxGYG becomes dynamic and unstable in the absence of K+, acquiring more stable conformations in the presence of K+, using NaK/NaK2K (non-selective and K+ selective) channels as models. This aim, giving new insights about ion channel selectivity, will be completed during the K99 phase. Development of additional techniques and theoretical skills will allow me to broaden my efforts in the R00 phase to the study of structural dynamics of channel gating mechanisms in more complex channels, including the pharmacologically relevant eukaryotic Two-Pore-Domain K+ channel family (K2P) that contributes to leak currents in excitable and non-excitable tissues. This K+ channel family plays a critical role in a multitude of physiological and pathological conditions and understanding the gating and selectivity mechanisms will help to modulate their behavior to overcome different pathologies. Overall, the proposed integrated research and training will facilitate my becoming an independent researcher using a wide range of cutting-edge techniques to assist in the better understanding of membrane protein structural dynamics in health and disease."
10904733,"The overarching goal of the UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) NRSA Training Program

translational research with real-world impact. The proposed TL1 training core is composed of two separate
programs: the established and highly successful predoctoral Yearlong Inquiry Program (YIP) for health
professional students and a newly focused Clinical Research Informatics Postdoctoral (CRISP) program for
clinical fellows. The primary goals of the YIP are to train and inspire exceptional and diverse young investigators
to embark on a life-long journey conducting a broad range of transformative clinical and translational research

The Liu laboratory at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard will serve as the Gene Editing Core for the Program.
Developing customized editing strategies that maximize therapeutic editing while minimizing undesired
byproducts is important for the success of all Research Projects. A centralized Gene Editing Core staffed by Liu
laboratory members will enhance the Program's efficiency by preventing bottlenecks in gene editing analyses
and ensuring consistency in methods and materials used in the proposed projects. The Gene Editing Core has
three central aims: 1) to assess on-target editing activity across all Research Projects from isolated cell lines and
from animal tissue samples; 2) to assess off-target editing activity in treated cells; 3) to optimize gene editing
technologies for therapeutic targets. The Core will play an essential role in generating rigorous analyses of gene
editing outcomes for the IND submission of our trailblazer project, coordinating closely with the Preclinical Mouse
Model Core analyze samples from large-scale efficacy studies. Additionally, the Core will facilitate the maturation
of the Follower Projects by continuing to develop the latest base editing and/or prime editing technologies in
model systems representative of each Follower Project's therapeutic target. Synergy between the Core and the
Follower Projects will enable the co-development of new genome editing tools that maximize on-target editing
efficiencies, minimize undesirable gene editing byproducts and off-target editing events, and maximize
compatibility with in vivo delivery methods of potential therapeutic relevance."
10842410,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 1 (SMA)
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a progressive motor neuron disease (MND) and the leading genetic cause of
infant mortality across all ethnic groups. SMA is caused by the homozygous loss of the essential survival motor
neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and while one or more copies of the highly similar SMN2 gene partially compensates for
the loss of SMN1 in SMA patients, SMN1, in contrast to SMN2, contains a C·G-to-T·A change at position 6 of
exon 7 (C6T). This change leads to skipping of exon 7 during mRNA splicing and the resulting truncated SMNΔ7
protein is rapidly degraded in cells. This rapid degradation results in SMN protein insufficiency, loss of motor
neurons, paralysis, and death. Patients with the most common form of SMA, type I, have a ~10-fold reduction in
SMN protein levels and live to a median age of 6 months if untreated.
In this trailblazer project, we aim to (1) Optimize base editing treatment protocols in Δ7 SMA mice; (2) Assess
biodistribution, off-targets, and toxicity profiles in SMA mice; and (3) Conduct large-scale efficacy studies. We
will work closely with the Gene Editing core to generate rigorous analyses of gene editing outcomes for the IND
submission of our trailblazer project, and we will coordinate closely with the Preclinical Mouse Model Core to
analyze samples from large-scale efficacy studies. The successful outcomes of this trailblazer project will also
inform the strategies used to develop genome editing-based therapeutic leads in all Follower Projects."
10892314,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Drug addiction is highly comorbid with psychiatric disorders, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
and major depressive disorder (MDD). These conditions share underlying genetic risk and are exacerbated by
similar environmental factors, including exposure to stress and traumatic events. The dorsal anterior cingulate
cortex (dACC), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and amygdala constitute key nodes of the brain’s reward circuitry,
and perturbations in reward signaling are highly implicated in addiction, MDD and PTSD. The human dACC,
NAc and amygdala have unique neuroanatomical features, which correspond to distinct biological functions.
Given the close relationship between brain structure and function, precisely assigning gene expression to the
spatial coordinates of individual cell populations within the cytoarchitecture can significantly advance our
understanding of how dysregulation in these areas contributes to addiction and comorbid neuropsychiatric
disorders. Towards this goal, we propose to generate detailed spatial transcriptomic maps, which will be
combined with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to register molecularly-defined cell types to their
spatial coordinates, facilitating prediction of the anatomical locations of distinct neuronal classes of cells within
the dACC, NAc and amygdala. These molecularly- and spatially-defined populations of cells will be associated
with gene expression changes linked to substance use and comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders. We
hypothesize that these regions have a precise molecular architecture that reveals 1) topographically organized
and molecularly-defined cell types within layers of the dACC, and across sub-regions of the NAc and amygdala;
2) spatial-enrichment of genes associated with addiction and comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders. By generating
the first transcriptome-scale spatial maps of the human dACC, NAc and amygdala, critical information about the
molecular landscape of these regions within the architecture of the human brain will be generated. Our spatial
registration approach will facilitate refined annotation of cell types in the human brain, and contribute to
understanding addiction and comorbid neuropsychiatric disorders by identifying clinical associations with
molecularly- and spatially-defined cell populations that can be targeted for prevention and treatment."
10896184,"Project Summary
All organisms must selectively regulate the uptake and extrusion of molecules from the environment. In addition
to identifying and importing crucial ions, nutrients, and transition metals, cells must also rigorously select and
export a wide range of substrates, including peptides, polysaccharides, and toxins. The cell employs ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporters to drive the unidirectional transport of substrates against their concentration
gradients. This proposal seeks to understand how prokaryotic ABC importers uptake nutrients that are crucial
for survival, and these findings could provide new targets for treatment against bacterial pathogens. Towards
this end, we will employ biochemical and biophysical methods to dissect how the E. coli MetNI transporter, an
established model system, transports methionine from the periplasm to the cytoplasm. While the most widely-
accepted model for import is based on structural studies, emerging functional studies suggest a substantially
different model for substrate translocation. These disparate models appear to conflict; however, we hypothesize
that the MetNI transporter can adopt multiple modes of transport in response to substrate features and
availability. We will use the tools of mechanistic enzymology to resolve these longstanding issues and to propose
new models that may merge previous findings or uncover entirely new mechanisms of action. In Aim 1, we will
test our hypothesis by measuring the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of individual steps in the transport
cycle. Using different substrates (L-Met, D-Met, and larger methionine derivatives) and binding-impaired
mutants, we will dissect three steps: (a) binding of the MetQ cognate periplasmic protein to the MetNI transporter,
(b) ATP binding and hydrolysis, and (c) transport. Our findings could reveal that the MetNI-Q mechanism is
inherently versatile and could preferentially select different translocation pathways depending on the substrate.
For Aim 2, we have generated heterodimeric MetNI “chimeras” to decipher if the two identical ATP sites work
together to enable efficient and specific transport. Specifically, we will determine if one or two ATP molecules
are hydrolyzed per transport cycle, and if transport efficiency is affected by impairment of one ATP site. Overall,
our findings will yield critical insights into how ABC transporters select for different substrates, and how ATP
usage drives substrate translocation across membranes."
10883649,"Project Summary
Nearly 120 years since the discovery of the first virus, our understanding of how viruses deliver genomes into
cells overcoming the complexity of biological membranes remains limited. While a vast scientific literature
exists on viral surface proteins and their interaction with host receptors, and the immune system, little
emphasis has been devoted to studying the delivery of entire viral genomes into cells. For instance, how do
bacteriophages eject DNA through the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria? Or, in humans, how do
herpesviruses deliver ~200 kb genome through the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) into the cell nucleus?
 For a quarter of a century, first as a trainee (1995-2003), and since 2004 as a principal investigator, I have
investigated the mechanisms of nucleocytoplasmic transport and viral genome packaging. My work has
resulted in close to 85 publications that contributed to elucidating the atomic structure and regulation of crucial
factors implicated in nuclear import, and viral genome packaging. In this R35, I propose to combine the study
of these two seemingly distinct biological processes by focusing on the mechanisms of viral genome delivery
into living cells. Specifically, I will ask two biological questions that seek to compare and contrast how simple
bacterial viruses (or bacteriophages) eject their DNA into bacteria with how Herpesviruses deliver their
complex genomes into the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. The first question explores how bacteriophages
eject ~45 kb genomes through the cell envelope of gram-negative bacteria. Long-thought to be a simple
pressure-driven injection, this process uses a virus-encoded nanomachine, which we have begun to study in
my laboratory. The second question explores how Herpesviruses deliver their large genome through the
Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) of human cells into the cell nucleus. This is a signal- and energy-mediated
process that uses host importins and the GTPase Ran, exploiting the cellular transport machinery to promote
entry of an exogenous genome into the nucleus. Overall, understanding how viruses transfer genetic
information through biological membranes into cells and organelles is vital for deciphering the molecular
mechanisms of virulence as well as the development of novel therapeutic approaches. The common
denominator of this R35 lies in our interest in the structure and transport mechanisms of biological
macromolecules. Our research approach marries established sciences like protein biochemistry and X-ray
crystallography with the power of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize biological macromolecules in
near-native conditions. We believe that this R35 MIRA funding mechanism will fuel the creative and diligent
pursuit of answers to the questions we pose, permitting our research program to achieve significant
advancements in structural biology."
10904977,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Simulations of knee biomechanics are increasingly utilized to develop individualized and actionable knowledge
regarding healthy homeostasis, impact of musculoskeletal diseases, and risk of injury. Computational modeling
is also appealing to predict performance and safety of implants, and informs surgical tissue reconstruction and
rehabilitation strategies. This is a natural result of the ubiquity of modeling and simulation in biomedicine, and it
is motivated by the knee being a primary concern in musculoskeletal healthcare. However, start-to-end and turn-
key examples of mechanistic simulations, to accelerate biomedical discovery and to routinely inform clinical care,
are scarce. In knee biomechanics specifically, the compelling promise of modeling and simulation has not been
fulfilled. Delivery of computational models and their intended utilization require many operations that collectively
define the modeling and simulation workflow. Variations in the modeler’s choices and the ambiguity of their
implementation introduce uncertainties that impact reproducibility across the modeling and simulation lifecycle,
from intermediate products to end-point simulation results. Reproducibility is essential to the broader credibility
of modeling practices. Its absence within an acceptable threshold, as dictated by the model’s intended use, is a
significant barrier for adoption of simulation. Scalable uses of knee models are also impeded by the burden of
modeling and simulation activities and a lack of specialized guidance. In the past award period, we documented
the art of modeling and simulation in knee biomechanics. Starting with the same data and with the intent to
simulate the same model use cases, five teams demonstrated how each team’s processes vary from others.
This resulted in differences in anatomical and mechanical representations of tissue structures and, most
importantly, simulation predictions. In the proposed project, we first aim to determine consensus workflows that
represent good practices in computational knee biomechanics. Consensus will be established specific to a
diverse set of model contexts of use as credibility frameworks already acknowledge the dependence of the depth
and intensity of modeling activities on the intended use of models. Context of use also dictates the fidelity of the
model, the amount of data to build the model and validate its predictions, computing resources, and subject-
specificity. Consensus building will be facilitated by the Delphi method, which will provide the means for a
structured and iterative outreach to the knee modeling experts worldwide. In the second aim, the reproducibility
and accuracy of context relevant consensus workflows will be tested against required resolution of simulation
outputs. Five teams will develop models and conduct simulations using the same data, with the same intent, and
this time, relying on the same modeling and simulation workflow. Documented and disseminated consensus
workflows, including outcomes and by-products of use cases, will unify, and possibly standardize, the highly
fragmented ecosystem of knee modeling approaches. Subsequently, they will enable multi-site, large scale, and
dependable in silico trials in knee biomechanics."
10863879,"Summary/Abstract: TGF-b is a key driver of lung fibrosis. The long-term goal of our research is to acquire a
deep understanding of the regulation of TGF-b activity to develop new strategies and treatments for fibrosing
lung disease. Currently, there are no effective therapies to treat lung fibrosis. The multifunctional cytokine TGF-
b is a potent mediator of fibrosis and is a potential therapeutic target in fibrosing lung disease. However,
targeting TGF-b itself or its receptors is associated with demonstrated risks as evidenced by toxicities in
rodents, primates and humans. More selective targeting of the fibroinflammatory effects of TGF-b, without
perturbing its normal essential functions are highly desirable. One property of TGF-b that may allow more
selective targeting is to target its “activation” since it is always produced in a latent form (L-TGF-b) that requires
activation in order to function. Another feature of L-TGF-b that could facilitate more specific targeting is to that
it is normally covalently bound to the extracellular matrix or to the surface of cells by association with TGF-b
binding proteins such as latent-TGF-b binding protein (LTBP) or glycoprotein-A repetitions predominant
(GARP). We and others have shown that L-TGF-b binding to two integrins, a 8 and a
vb
vb
6 is essential for
TGF-b activation in vivo. For the integrin a 6 activation mechanism, it has long been assumed that TGF-b
vb
must be released from LAP so that free TGF-b can diffuse and bind its receptors on target cells. The structural
mechanism for such release of TGF-b is incompletely understood since full-length a
vb
6 has not been studied
in complex with TGF-b bound to TGF-b binding proteins. Based on recent structural data obtained using single
particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), we have recently proposed a new model whereby a
vb
8 can bind
to L-TGF-b on cells presenting the L-TGF-b/GARP complex and induce signaling without release and diffusion
of TGF-b. These two different models of TGF-b activation may be able to be separately targeted, which could
help mitigate therapeutic risk. Here in four aims, we will employ a structure-based approach to address the
mechanism of a
vb
6-mediated TGF-b activation. We will use the technique of electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-
EM), which is a technique that allows for high-resolution structures of proteins and protein complexes in
physiologically relevant conditions. Cryo-EM will be used to examine the role of integrin a
vb
6 conformation in
the mechanism of TGF-b activation. These studies will improve mechanistic understanding of TGF-b activation
and therapeutic targeting strategies to more selectively and safely inhibit it."

Their success depends on their ability to work in interdisciplinary groups and consortia, to understand concepts across the spectrum of laboratory to clinical and public health sciences, and to implement advances in clinical and community settings. The Kidney, Urology and Hematology (KUH) Division of NIDDK has challenged its community to redesign its research training programs to meet these needs. In response, the Cleveland Kidney, Urology and Hematology Training Network (KUH-TN) will identify promising MD and PhD predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows and to provide them with the intellectual and methodological tools to accelerate discovery and its translation for treatment and cure of kidney, urologic and hematologic diseases within an interdisciplinary environment embedded in an ecosystem of
mentorship and peer and near-peer learners. The Cleveland KUH-TN has access to the scientific expertise, infrastructure, support services and programs at two universities, Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland State University and four affiliated academic health centers. In addition, the KUH-TN has strong support from the Cleveland Translational Sciences Collaborative. To accomplish our mission and address the needs of modern scientific research training, we propose the following specific aims:
1. Create a Training Core (TL1) that embraces interdisciplinary learning by identifying themes that cross K-U-, and H-silos, executes research-intensive training using hand-on project, didactics and peer interactions to develop domain competence the prepares KUN-TN trainees for career success.
2. Develop a Professional Development Core that enhances trainee competitiveness in research by ensuring trainees acquire foundational skills for state-of-the-art scientific inquiry. Learning opportunities will happen in the classroom and by informal peer interactions using in person and virtual platforms. This core will further support trainee acquisition of domain competence by providing training to mentors in best practices.
3. Implement a Networking Core to develop a KUH-TN community using in-person and virtual platforms and social events that includes trainees, their peers, and the training faculty and an outreach program to undergraduates and high schools to increase the future KUH-TN candidate pool. This program builds on existing successful partnerships, which engage underrepresented groups.
The KUH-TN will be managed by the Administrative Core, which oversees program organization, governance, collaboration, communication, as well as evaluation and continuous improvement.
In summary, we believe our outstanding training faculty, broad choice of research projects and strong mentoring make our proposed KUH-TN attractive for the best applicants to pursue training in a multidisciplinary community of learners, which bring innovative approaches to address the challenges of KUH research training.
To improve human health, students must emerge from their scientific training with skills, which will enable them to address unmet health needs with effectiveness, efficiency and economy.

10847524,"Project Summary
Roughly half of females with child welfare involvement report a pregnancy by age 19 , which is twice the rate of
a national sample of youth of similar age and racial/ethnic composition. To date, little is known about sexual
and reproductive health of youth with child welfare involvement beyond that they are at increased risk of
unintended pregnancy. Even less is known about the sexual and reproductive health of younger adolescents,
males, and youth who are not removed from their homes, and few data exist on contraceptive access and use.
Contraceptive access and use are critical, not only because of their implications for reducing unintended
pregnancy, but because of their effect on agency, autonomy, and lifelong socioeconomic opportunities. While
contraceptive access and use have been studied in other populations, these topics are likely distinct for youth
with child welfare involvement, given disruptions they commonly experience with systems and adults who
typically provide such education and support (i.e., families, schools), and the unique connection to another
formal system - child welfare. This project fills these gaps by using existing data from a longitudinal study of
youth with open child welfare cases during the transition to high school. The multi-wave study interviewed male
and female participants (n=245) three times across adolescence (between ages 12 to 18), and included key
variables on contraceptive access and use, sexual and reproductive health attitudes, psychosocial predictors,
and child welfare characteristics. We will first estimate the longitudinal experiences of contraceptive access
across these critical adolescent ages (Aim 1). We will also code open-ended responses to items on sources of
contraceptive access and types of contraceptives used and describe themes. After estimating trajectories of
contraceptive access and use, this project will examine modifiable factors that may buffer the risk of adversities
that youth with child welfare involvement face (Aim 2). Specifically, the project will examine whether the
following predict contraceptive access and use: a) sexual and reproductive health attitudes, b) school
attachment, c) adult social support, and d) future orientation. In Aim 3, we will assess how relationships
between the modifiable factors and contraceptive access and use may differ depending on biological sex,
race/ethnicity, and living instability. Thus, in addition to contributing knowledge around what promotes
contraceptive access and use, this project will shed light on for whom those factors predict these contraceptive
outcomes. This project will open the door for interventions and services by providing basic data on
contraceptive access and use, identifying factors that promote reproductive agency and autonomy, and
distinguishing how these factors may differ by key demographic and child welfare characteristics for a
population who encounter marginalization through a collection of intersecting identities and adverse childhood
experiences."

 Diversifying the biomedical workforce is a priority of the US government scientific funding agencies. To
fulfill these priorities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority serving institutions
have continued to play an outsized role in training underrepresented minority (URM) students. Specifically,
Meharry Medical College (MMC) has been a leader in training URM students in basic, translational, and clinical
research. Our graduate, medical and dental students are often first-generation college students, and first from
their community to pursue training in biomedical research. Importantly, our trainees are role models for the next
generation and often mentor and educate URM students post-graduation. Consistent with our history of providing
care to the underserved since 1876, MMC is playing a vital role in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. As
evident with other infectious diseases, COVID-19 disproportionally affects minority health, specifically African
Americans and Hispanics. A key strategy to combat these evolving pathogens is to train the next generation of
virologists from diverse backgrounds. The urgent need for a diverse workforce in virology is acutely felt during
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that has ravaged the World and disproportionately affected the minority
population in the US. Furthermore, increasing the number of virologists from URM backgrounds is also critical
to fight against deadly diseases caused by viruses such as HIV, Influenza, Ebola, and others. To address this
unmet need, we propose the “Enhancing Virology Training (ENVIT) through Summer Research” program.
The goal of this program is to prepare and increase the number of URM students in virology-focused
careers. This 10-week program will provide an intensive research experience for graduate, medical and dental
students. A local, regional, and nationwide recruitment strategy will be employed to attract URM students. We
will provide classroom teaching and hands-on laboratory training in basic virology, lectures/seminars on career-
development, scientific writing, communications skills and networking. Each student will work under the
mentorship of a faculty mentor from Meharry Medical College (MMC) and/or Vanderbilt University Medical Center
(VUMC) on a research project that focused on virology. The participants will attend seminars that allow
interactions with virologists and expose students to career opportunities in virology. The program will end with a
one-day Virology Mini-Symposium where students will showcase their research. This mini-symposium will also
feature a keynote lecture from a national/international leader from the virology field. Finally, the ENVIT program
will track the career path of participants to evaluate the extent to which program goals were met, and identify
areas for improvement. Evaluations from research mentors will also be used to assess and improve the program.
These focused research experiences and career development activities will meaningfully increase engagement
of URM students in the area of virology and diversify the biomedical workforce specifically needed to fight the

While reductions in medial temporal lobe (MTL) white matter tract microstructure have been suggested to have
a central role in longitudinal cognitive decline in aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it is unknown what
genetic factors drive these reductions. The objective of this proposal is to use MTL white matter tract templates
in conjunction with genome-wide analyses to identify the genetic drivers of white matter tract microstructure.
This proposal will leverage several aging datasets, including the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(n=525), Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (n=295), Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging
Project/Minority Aging Research Study (n=414), Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project (n=319), Wisconsin
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (n=488), and Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (n=468) to
conduct all analyses, totaling in 2,509 participants. Moreover, validation of all results will be conducted using
data from a well-established lifespan study (UK Biobank (n=14,701)) and data from the AD Genetics
Consortium. The central hypothesis is that MTL white matter tract microstructure is driven by genes and
pathways related to myelination, axonal transport, and neuroinflammation in aging and AD. Based on this
hypothesis, the primary aims of this proposal will take a multi-level approach to understand which genes and
pathways lead to MTL white matter microstructure by using: (1) a candidate gene approach to determine with
AD-risk genes are associated with MTL white matter microstructure, (2) a genome-wide approach to identify
novel variants which contribute to MTL white matter microstructure and quantify genetic overlap with other
traits, and (3) a genome-wide approach to identify how gene expression is associated with MTL white matter
tract microstructure and localize signals to relevant biologic pathways. The complementary training plan will
equip me with the skills necessary to transition to an independent career focused on imaging genetics by
emphasizing the following training objectives: (a) expand expertise in computational genetics, (b) acquire a
practical understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of AD, and (c) enhance my skillset in
data harmonization and big data analytical techniques. The mentoring team is made up of experts in each of
these areas, and their training will be augmented through formal coursework, interdisciplinary training at the
Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer’s Center, and cutting-edge computational and genomic resources available at
the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Together, these practical and intellectual resources provide the ideal
training environment, and my primary mentor, Dr. Timothy Hohman, has a well-funded laboratory which will
provide all the necessary resources for career transition. These resources will allow me to dedicate 100%
protected effort as an Assistant Professor to focus on research and career development. This will ensure that I
can competitively compete for independent funding (R01) over the course of the proposed award period."
10895468,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer is common cancer with an estimated 81,190 new cases and 17,240 deaths in 2018 (with >
500,000 survivors) only in the US. The gold standard for diagnosis of bladder cancer includes an invasive
optical bladder examination (cystoscopy) and tumor resection for pathology examination. Because of a high
recurrence rate of this cancer (50-80%), frequent (once every 3-6-12 months) costly and invasive cystoscopy
exams are required to monitor patients for recurrence and/or progression to a more advanced stage. It makes
bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to monitor/follow up and treat per patient. Moreover, the invasive
nature of the current standard of care, cystoscopy, causes rather low compliance of patient to follow this
procedure. There is an urgent unmet need for a bladder cancer screening and monitoring test, which will be
noninvasive, rapid, objective, reproducible, easy to perform and interpret, and highly accurate. Such a test will
reduce the need in frequent cystoscopies and greatly expand the participation of patients in screening and
early detection programs because it decreases the patient discomfort and post-procedural complications.
 Here we propose to develop such a test for identification of the presence of bladder cancer and its
aggressiveness (grade). It will be based on non-invasive analysis of individual cells extracted from urine
(extraction technology already exists in hospitals for voided urine cytology tests, (VUC) the current standard-of-
care, a non-invasive examination of cells in urine used to assist with cancer diagnosis and surveillance). A
novel modality of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) will be used for nanoscale imaging of cells extracted from
urine, mapping/imaging of the physical properties of the cell surface. The collected images will further be
analyzed using machine-learning methods and novel advanced statistical approaches to identify a “digital
signature” of cancer. The proposed technology is fundamentally different from previously studied urine
biomarkers and all existing physical methods because it is based on the analysis of physical properties of the
cell surface, not cell bulk or presence of biochemical markers or genetic analysis.
 Our strong preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, its presumed
superiority compared to the currently used non-invasive methods, and lead us to the central hypothesis that
bladder cancer can be identified by analyzing a small number of cells randomly chosen from urine samples,
with a low sampling error. This is a substantial departure from VUC tests, which require a visual analysis of
many cells. Supported by the preliminary data, we propose (1) to optimize and expand the method, (2) to
define the accuracy of cancer detection on a large cohort of patients, and (3) to assess the accuracy of
identification of aggressiveness (low versus high grade) of bladder cancer.
 Our long-term goal is to develop a non-invasive clinical method for accurate detecting of presence and
monitoring bladder cancer as well as many other cancers, in which cells can be extracted from easily
accessible bodily fluids without the need for tissue biopsy (e.g urine-bladder & upper urinary tract cancer, stool-
colorectal cancer, sputum-aerodigestive cancer, cervical smears-cervical cancer etc.), using methods based
on the analysis of physical characteristics of the cell surface. The proposed research, which is the first step in
pursuit of this overarching goal."
10894666,"ABSTRACT: InSiGHT-ClinGen Polyposis /Colon Cancer (ICPC) Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP)
The goal of the InSiGHT-ClinGen Polyposis /Colon Cancer (ICPC) Variant Curation Expert Panel (VCEP) is to
create and maintain a multidisciplinary panel of Biocurators and Experts to curate the pathogenicity of genetic
variants for genes associated with Colon Polyposis and Hereditary Colorectal Cancer (CRC). The NIH has
prioritized identifying genomic variants associated with diseases of high priority and systematically determining
their clinical significance for diagnosis and treatment. The Clinical Genome (ClinGen) project, NIH-funded
since 2013, is dedicated to defining the clinical relevance of genes and variants for use in precision medicine
and research. Our ICPC VCEP addresses a major clinical need, that of curating multiple genes that predispose
to polyposis and hereditary CRC, which are common indications for genetic testing for cancer risk assessment.
The VCEP represents a merger of two major efforts: 1) Classification of genetic variants by the International
Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumors (InSIGHT), which has been ongoing by the InSIGHT Variant
Interpretation Committee (VIC) since 2011, but has been limited to variants in the Mismatch Repair (MMR)
genes that cause Lynch syndrome. 2) The ClinGen Colon Cancer Gene Curation Expert Panel (CRC GCEP),
an unfunded working group (WG). The CRC GCEP, Co-chaired by the Co-PIs of this proposal, has evaluated
gene-phenotype associations (Seifert 2019) but has not curated individual variants. Also, the ClinGen
Sequence Variant Interpretation (SVI) working group has been refining variant curation rules established by the
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology.
Members of these teams (InSiGHT VIC and ClinGen CRC GCEP, with input from the ClinGen SVI) are primed
to expand variant curation efforts to new colon cancer and polyposis risk genes. Our ICPC VCEP plan provides
the necessary administrative structure for sustainable ongoing curation activities for multiple genes. Specific
Aims are: 1) Create and maintain a VCEP of Biocurators, Coordinator, and Experts to curate the pathogenicity
of genetic variants for genes associated with Colon Polyposis and Hereditary CRC; 2) Analyze and classify
variants from: APC, MUTYH, STK11, SMAD4, BMPR1A, POLE, & POLD1 genes; 3) Perform gene-phenotype
curation on genes with some reported evidence of association with polyposis or colorectal cancer, but not yet
found to be Definitive or Strong, to guide future VCEP efforts. We will utilize the procedures, interfaces, tools
and informatics infrastructure from ClinGen and the NCBI ClinVar database. Collectively, the VCEPs PIs and
Co-Is have the scientific, clinical, and administrative expertise to advance variant curation efforts for a
common, important pre-cancerous clinical condition, hereditary polyposis and CRC."
10851981,"Project Summary/Abstract
Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common neurodegenerative dementia in the United States and
one of the Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRDs). It affects 1.4 million Americans and their
caregivers. Individuals with LBD are affected by both physical and cognitive impairments, and eventually
require continuous supervision leading to high caregiver burden. A patient-centric specialized interdisciplinary
care model, the Neuromedicine Service and Science Hub model, addresses physical, cognitive, nutritional,
social support, and caregiver needs. However, this model of care is not easily accessible or offered across the
country. The overarching goal of my proposal is to improve patient and caregiver health outcomes by
increasing access to specialty care for individuals with LBD and their caregivers. The objective of the proposed
study is to convert this in-person patient-centric interdisciplinary care model to a virtual platform using
stakeholder engagement (Aim 1). After adapting the care model to virtual delivery, I will conduct a pilot
randomized, controlled clinical trial including 30 individuals with LBD and their caregivers for 6 months to
determine the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of this intervention, as well as to obtain pilot
outcome data (Aim 2). Additionally, the study will pilot the usability of a wearable sensor to objectively assess
patient outcomes, including life space mobility (Aim 3). Life space mobility, a measure of the area in which
someone moves through, closely correlates with quality of life, falls, and mortality. My research goal is to
establish and iteratively improve a virtual interdisciplinary model of care allowing patients with LBD and their
caregivers to access sub-specialty care from their home. Through this K23, I have organized an
interdisciplinary mentoring committee and training plan to develop expertise in pragmatic clinical trial design,
dissemination and implementation science, qualitative research methods, data analysis, and research conduct.
The mentoring team consists of world-renowned experts in interdisciplinary models of care in
neurodegenerative conditions (Michael Okun, Benzi Kluger), stakeholder engagement and qualitative research
in LBD (Melissa Armstrong, James Galvin), dissemination and implementation science (Stephanie Staras) and
wearable technology (Todd Manini). This research will be conducted at the Fixel Institute for Neurological
Diseases at the University of Florida, which has the integrated telemedicine capabilities, interdisciplinary care
framework, and clinical/research resources to conduct this study. The expertise and skills gained by this 5 year
career development award will help accomplish my long-term career goal to become an independent
investigator researching effective care delivery to individuals with LBD and their caregivers."
10891577,"Arboviruses such as, Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV), have been associated with several global epidemics.
DENV infections can result in a mild fever to potentially fatal dengue shock syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever
and death, while ZIKV infections can result in congenital microcephaly and the development of autoimmune
diseases. Initial clinical manifestation of DENV and ZIKV disease are similar and co-infections have been
reported. Most challenging, DENV and ZIKV are known to co-circulate, increasing the probability of co-infections,
and thus the potential for severe disease. Consequently, since there is no effective vaccine or form of treatment
for either virus, the development of anti-ZIKV and anti-DENV therapeutics is an urgent unmet medical need.
 Over the past decade prodrugs of nucleotides, referred to as ProTides, have been found to have potent
antiviral activity. The anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug sofosbuvir (FDA approved 2013) is the most notable
ProTide success, since its use in combination therapy can clear Hepatis C virus infections. Recently, a similar
ProTide, remdesivir, has been approved by the FDA, Japan, the European Union an Australia for the treatment
of severe SARs-CoV-2 infections by intravenous injection. Carboxyesterase-anhydride-HINT1 (CAH) ProTides,
such as sofosbuvir and remdesivir, utilize a four step activation process based on initial esterase hydrolysis,
carboxylic acid nucleophilic attack at the phosphorous and release of phenol, followed by mixed anhydride
chemical hydrolysis, and finally phosphoramidate hydrolysis by hHINT1. Unfortunately, although they can be
dosed intravenously, due to high first pass metabolism, CAH-Protides are limited in their use as oral drugs to
viral hepatitis. Furthermore, due to the high carboxyesterase activity of rodent plasma, it has been difficult to
carry out pre-clinical studies with rodents and translationally relevant dosages of CAH-ProTides.
 To address the inherent issues surrounding current ProTide approaches, our group has
designed an alternative ProTide approach, we refer to as anchimerically HINT1 activated proTides
(AHA-ProTides). Our laboratory has demonstrated that AHA-proTides can be designed that are stable,
orally bioavailable, cell permeable and dependent on HINT phosphoramidate hydrolysis. Recently, we
have also demonstrated that AHA proTides can be prepared with enhanced potency against DENV
and ZIKV. Consequently, we propose to the design and develop anti-DENV and anti-ZIKV AHA
ProTides that can serve as advanced lead compounds for the potential treatment of both DENV
and ZIKV disease."

Tumor heterogeneity -- the complex mix of tumor subclones, the cell-of-origin that first became transformed,
the evolution of tumor subclones under selective pressures of the body and due to treatment, and the interplay
of these cells with the tumor microenvironment (TME) -- contributes to the character, behavior, and mystery of
tumors and is a key determinant of cancer progression and a patient’s response to therapy. Large-scale
genomics projects like the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genome Data Analysis Network (GDAN)
have revealed important characteristics and patterns from a multi-omics overview of various tumor types.
However, it remains a mystery on how to maximize the use of these data to choose the best course of
treatment for an individual patient. The proposed GDAN will close this gap in knowledge by collecting clinical
information and outcomes endpoints alongside the multiple omics platforms that will provide key linkages upon
which to train supervised computational approaches. We propose to contribute our key competencies of
pathway analysis, integrative machine-learning, mRNA-seq analysis, assessment of driving somatic mutations,
and visualization of high-throughput datasets to serve the future GDAN analysis working groups (AWGs) to
achieve these goals. We will collect and share widely a database of gene expression signatures that capture
cell state information gleaned from the large collection of single-cell mRNA sequencing data such as from the
Human Cell Atlas (Aim 1). In addition, we will contribute our existing, and novel extensions to,
machine-learning approaches like AKIMATE to maximally use these signatures and others in combination with
AWG-approved omics datasets as features to train accurate predictors of response for the GDAN’s studies like
ALCHEMIST (Aim 2). Our proposal will adapt the TumorMap to benefit weekly analysis and bolster the
exploration and publication of results. Specifically, we will work with the group to create new maps that show
the TME and TIC comparisons of the patient samples separately to help elucidate new important subtypes
implied by the collected data (Aim 3). As we have done for the past twelve years for TCGA and the GDAN, we
propose to continue working closely with the consortium in these endeavors to significantly enrich our
understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of tumor heterogeneity and its influence on cancer
progression and treatment response."

10891587,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cure rates for childhood cancers have improved. Unfortunately, many survivors now live with life-long side
effects from treatment itself. Radiation therapy, used for brain tumors, is particularly damaging. The most
serious side effect is necrosis which can result in weakness, paralysis or even death. Proton therapy is an
increasingly popular radiation modality. Proton therapy reduces exposure to normal tissues and the reby
may decrease the incidence of cognitive deficits following radiation. However, recent studies, including our
own suggest that certain areas of proton beams may be more damaging to brain tissue than others
potentially leading to higher rates of necrosis. Here we will develop high accuracy models to correlate
necrosis with the physical parameters of proton beams. These models will include multi-cell type human
brain “organoids” as well as rodent animal models. Using these models as well as clinical data, we will
identify the physical factors of proton therapy which may lead to necrosis. This is significant in that this data
may be used to design safer proton therapy treatments in which the most biologically effective portions of
beams are solely placed within the tumor. This should reduce necrosis and improve disease control. In a
second component of our study, we will examine the molecular mechanisms of necrosis. Rather than being
simple dis-organized death, we will determine if radiation induces an orderly programmed cell death
pathway. We will conduct the following aims; (1) relate the physical factors of proton beams with biological
response, (2) explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms of radiation induced brain damage and (3)
validate the clinical consequences of variability in the effectiveness of proton beams. The knowledge gained
will quickly influence the treatment of brain tumor patients and expedite the clinical introduction of agents
and approaches to combat the negative effects of radiation on the brain."

The overall goal of the Discovery Science Collaborative for CKDu Renal Science Core is to bring the best
investigative methods and scientific technology to the problem of CKDu. We will work closely with Field
Epidemiology Sites, the Scientific Data Coordinating Center, NIDDK Leadership, the External Oversight
Committee, and HHEAR to design clinical phenotyping studies and perform discovery science experiments.
We will then integrate this data to elucidate the etiology and progression factors of CKDu occurring in diverse
agricultural communities. The Renal Science Core is a multi-institutional collaborative organized around six
Core components: Genomics, Pathology, Transcriptomics, Biomarkers, Physiology, and Bioinformatics. The
specific aims of the RSC are to: (1) characterize the clinical phenotypes and natural history of patients with
CKDu and unaffected individuals in CKDu-endemic regions, comparing features across CKDu sites and
determining the degree of similarities and differences across sites and regions; (2) introduce cutting-edge
molecular technologies to compare the risk factors and pathophysiology of CKDu across and within study sites
to understand both shared and unique aspects of the etiology of disease; (3) define the relationship between
AKI and CKDu in endemic regions; and (4) build a flexible, adaptable infrastructure for both hypothesis- and
non-hypothesis-based approaches to understanding etiology that will form the core of ongoing CKDu studies.
The leadership team of the RSC has extensive experience working on CKDu, a history of collaboration on
international working groups, and leadership roles on other major NIDDK consortia. This group brings together
expertise in nephrology, genomics, nephropathology, machine learning algorithms for digital pathology, single-
cell transcriptomics, biomarker development, proteomics, metabolomics, renal physiology, bioinformatics, and
data integration. We have also enlisted several advisors with expertise in novel pathogen discovery, novel

10890040,"2.5% of United States population is affected by alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), which represents the
eighth most common cause of mortality. Despite significant progress in the field, the complex mechanisms
driving the onset and progression of ALD are still not fully understood. cAMP is a second messenger that plays
a critical role in regulating multiple cellular functions via its effectors (e.g. protein kinase A). Amplitude and
duration of cAMP signaling is fine-tuned by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) via cAMP hydrolysis and degradation.
Our work has shown that ethanol increases expression of hepatic PDE4 in experimental ALD as well as in
alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) patients’ livers. However, their role in ALD pathogenesis is not clear. We
started elucidating the role of PDE4s in ALD by demonstrating that Pde4b plays a critical role in ethanol-
mediated impairment of fatty acid β-oxidation and steatosis. We also showed that inhibition of PDE4 activity
attenuates liver injury in in vivo and in vitro models of ALD. However, underlying mechanisms of ethanol
mediated induction of PDE4 enzymes have not been determined. Moreover, how PDE4 inhibition exerts its
beneficial effect on dysregulated lipid metabolism and hepatocytes survival is not fully understood. Our
preliminary studies using animal and cell models of ALD identified novel pathways of ethanol and PDE4-
mediated regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and cell injury which have never been examined before. Based
on our previous work and preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that ethanol via cytochrome p450
(CYP2E1) mediated increase in hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1α) induces hepatic PDE4 which
contributes to dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism and injury.
The specific objectives of these mechanistic studies are to:
Aim 1: Determine the underlying mechanisms of PDE4 upregulation by ethanol in hepatocytes.
Aim 2: Determine mechanisms underlying ethanol/PDE4-mediated de novo lipogenesis and hepatic
steatosis.
Aim 3: Determine the role of MKP1 in ethanol/PDE4-mediated toxicity in hepatocytes.
The ultimate goal of this application is to identify not only the mechanisms of PDE4 upregulation, but also the
role of PDE4s in the development of ALD. Importantly, we predict that these preclinical studies will provide
strong rationale using PDE4 specific inhibitors in the treatment of ALD. Importantly, there are potent PDE4
inhibitors that are already FDA-approved for the treatment of other inflammatory disease processes, and these
inhibitors could potentially be repurposed for ALD."

Kidney disease is worldwide health problem that is becoming increasingly common. Primary glomerular
disease, both genetic and acquired, represents a significant proportion of cases. We are interested in
understanding the makeup of the glomerular filtration barrier and how it becomes damaged, leaky to
plasma proteins, and eventually non-functional. Our focus has been to investigate the composition and
function of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a specialized extracellular matrix that is an
integral component of the kidney’s filtration barrier. The GBM contains collagen IV, laminin, nidogen, and
the heparan sulfate proteoglycan agrin, and likely dozens of other less abundant matrix proteins. Although
the GBM is synthesized by both podocytes and glomerular endothelial cells, it is exclusively podocytes
that make the major collagen IV isoform, which consists of the 3, 4, and 5 chains that assemble to
form a secreted heterotrimer. Mutations that affect this collagen IV component of the GBM cause Alport
syndrome, which leads to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) as well as hearing and eye defects. The
prevalence of Alport syndrome has been estimated to be 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 newborns, so there are
hundreds of thousands of affected patients around the world. Structural GBM abnormalities secondary to
the collagen IV defect lead to thickening and splitting of the GBM and eventually podocyte foot process
effacement, glomerulosclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Until recently there has been no treatment
for Alport syndrome. However, studies in mice and dogs had shown that ACE inhibition slows kidney
disease progression to ESKD. These animal studies have been validated in human Alport syndrome
patients, for whom ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers are now considered the standard of
care. Despite this treatment breakthrough that delays ESKD, it is not a cure; there is still a need for new
targeted therapies. The goal of this proposal is to use innovative, state of the art technologies that involve
small molecule, genetic, and protein biochemistry approaches to attempt to either restore the Alport GBM
to a somewhat normal composition or to alter its composition through removal of pathogenic components.
In either case, the expectation is that improving GBM composition will at least partially normalize GBM
structure and function. Together with renin-angiotensin system blockade as a standard of care, these
treatments should greatly delay the time to ESKD and be beneficial for patients."
10887569,"Weight loss is critical to overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for improving glycemic
control, cardiovascular risk factors, and quality of life. However, weight loss has been found to be associated
with increased bone loss and risk for fractures by many studies, including the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look
AHEAD) trial in which we observed an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) for weight loss was associated with
39% increased risk for frailty fracture (hip, pelvis, upper arm, or shoulder fractures) compared with diabetes
support and education (DSE) (control group) among overweight or obese patients with T2D. Frailty fractures are
devastating and represent a part of osteoporotic fracture types. We also observed the ILI was associated with
increased bone loss in a subgroup of Look AHEAD who also had dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans.
However, the mechanisms linking the ILI and increased risk of fracture are still largely unknown but very
important for developing effective methods for protecting bone and preventing fracture during intentional weight
loss. The overall goal of this proposed study is to identify metabolomic changes which mediate the effect of ILI
on the increased risk for frailty fracture in the Look AHEAD trial using a state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach. In this study, we will include 4,659 Look AHEAD
participants (2,357 in ILI and 2,302 in DSE) who had blood samples collected at both baseline and the 1-year
visit and had a median follow-up of 11.3 years for fracture outcomes. Among those, 1,274 participants (642 in
ILI and 632 in DSE) also had DXA scans for bone mineral density (BMD) at both baseline and year 1. In this
study, we will further measure serum bone turnover markers (BTMs) and reanalyze DXA images to obtain the
trabecular bone score (TBS) to evaluate bone metabolism and bone microarchitecture (an indicator of bone
quality) in the DXA subgroup. A comprehensive two-stage metabolomics approach, including an
untargeted/global metabolomics analysis with relative quantification followed by chemical structure validation
and absolute quantification, will support the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) To examine the effects of ILI on
changes in metabolomic profiles from baseline to year 1; Aim 2) To examine whether 1-year changes in
metabolomic profiles are associated with and mediate the effect of ILI on the risk of frailty fracture; Aim 3) To
examine whether 1-year changes in metabolomic profiles are associated with changes in BTMs, BMD, and TBS;
and Aim 4) To examine whether baseline metabolomic profiles modify the effect of ILI on the risk of frailty fracture.
The proposed study will provide comprehensive insights into the biological mechanisms underlying the increased
risk of frailty fracture caused by the ILI. These findings will help discover molecular targets for blocking the
detrimental effect of intentional weight loss on bone health. The study will also provide novel biomarkers for
predicting the risk of frailty fracture and directing the personalization and optimization of lifestyle intervention for
weight loss among overweight and obese patients with T2D."

COVID-19 revealed weaknesses in respiratory pathogen surveillance. Tools to detect SARS-CoV-2 were
initially limited. Now that SARS-CoV-2 is prevalent, schools and other congregate settings struggle to
perform systematic surveillance. As influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens return to co-exist
alongside SARS-CoV-2, pandemic fatigue undermines risk mitigation strategies that rely on behavior
modification, creating an unprecedented risk of illness-caused absenteeism in schools.
We hypothesize that frequent air sampling in K-12 schools is a simple, inexpensive, and accurate sur-
veillance strategy for identifying when schools and the communities where they are located are at high
risk for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus transmission.
In this study, we will place an air sampler inside each of 16 K-12 schools and collect continuous air sam-
ples twice weekly throughout the school year. We will test air samples for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza vi-
rus, the two leading causes of respiratory virus absenteeism. A key question is whether detecting these
viruses in air samples is non-inferior to comprehensive individual testing of people with influenza-like
illnesses. We are partnering with the Oregon (Wisconsin) School District which already performs in-
school rapid diagnostic testing of symptomatic individuals. Within this unique setting, we can determine
if the detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are similar between air surveillance and diagnostic
testing of individuals. If they are similar, this would suggest that simple, inexpensive, and anonymous
air sampling programs could be the foundation of school-based sentinel virus surveillance programs.
We will also determine whether detecting and sequencing SARS-CoV-2 in air samples forecasts broader
community disease spread. Using SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, wastewater, environmental, and mo-
bility data alongside in-school air sampler detection and sequencing data, we will develop and iterate a
model using air sampler data to forecast community transmission. We will extend this model to forecast
the risk for influenza viruses that are not currently surveilled systematically.
Successfully developing precision air sampler surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in a large
public school setting would provide a model for a nationwide surveillance program. Such a program
would lead to safer classrooms, improve awareness of respiratory viruses that threaten specific commu-
nities, and increase resilience to respiratory pathogens that threaten schools in the future."

Neurodevelopmental processes are shaped by dynamic interactions between genes and environments.
Maladaptive experiences early in life can alter developmental trajectories, leading to harmful and enduring
developmental sequelae. Pre- and postnatal hazards include maternal substance exposure, toxicant
exposures in pregnancy and early life, maternal health conditions, parental psychopathology, maltreatment,
structural racism, and excessive stress. To elucidate how various environmental hazards impact child
development, it is imperative that a normative template of developmental trajectories over the first 10 years of
life be established based on a sufficiently large and demographically diverse sample of the US population. To
accomplish this, the Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium (HBCD-NC) has been formed
to deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative set of neuroimaging (MRI, EEG) measures complemented
by an extensive battery of behavioral, physiological, and psychological tools, and biospecimens to understand
neurodevelopmental trajectories in a sample of 7,500 mothers and infants enrolled at 24 sites across the
United States (US). The HBCD-NC will carry out a common research protocol under direction of the HBCD-
NC Administrative Core (HCAC) and will assemble and distribute a comprehensive and well-curated research
dataset to the scientific community at large under the direction of the HBCD-NC Data Coordinating Center
(HDCC). The overarching goal of the HBCD-NC is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-

racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse cohort that is representative of the US population; 2)
pregnant woman with use of targeted substances (opioids, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco); and 3)
demographically and behaviorally similar women without substance use in pregnancy to enable valid causal
inferences. In addition, the HBCD-NC will identify key developmental windows during which both harmful and

This K24 midcareer research and mentoring program aims to provide the candidate with protected time from
direct patient care to conduct patient-oriented research (POR) on adolescent alcohol misuse and to mentor
early-career clinical investigators in translational research in addiction science. To meet the challenge of
advancing treatment options for the millions of American youth who struggle to reduce their alcohol use, the
field requires highly trained researchers who can integrate cutting-edge concepts and methods from a variety
of areas. As our understanding of addiction has become more complex, so too has the training needs of early-
career scientists. For more than two decades, the candidate has built a productive and continuously funded
POR program that translates theory-driven hypotheses from preclinical and human laboratory research to real
world applications. The proposed integrated plan will facilitate the candidate’s ability to mentor early-career
clinical investigators in POR and augment his capabilities as an independent clinician scientist. The research
plan, which focuses on improving treatment options for adolescent alcohol misuse through digital health,
dovetails the mentoring goals by providing a vehicle for mentoring early career scientists in: i) mechanisms of
alcohol use disorder pathogenesis and treatment effects, ii) clinical trial methods, iii) ecological momentary
assessment approaches, and iv) training in the responsible conduct of research. The candidate’s goal is to
further develop and refine an experimental therapeutics approach that yields high quality information to inform
decisions about whether further development of novel treatments is warranted. This K24 will support the
collection of pilot data for an integrative digital health platform based on gold standard psychosocial
interventions for treating AUD among adolescents. Adolescence is a critical period for the pathogenesis of
AUD. Alcohol use typically begins during adolescence and prevalence rates for AUD peak before age 21. Yet,
despite clinical demand, AUD treatments for youth rely on psychosocial interventions that yield only modest
benefits. One potential way to improve adolescent alcohol treatment is to augment the best available
psychosocial interventions with innovative digital health solutions."

 The composition of the gut microbiome has been shown to determine responsiveness or resistance to
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-PD-1, in patients with melanoma and other cancers. Unfortunately,
although immunotherapy works well in glioblastoma (GBM) pre-clinical mouse models, the therapy has not
demonstrated efficacy in humans. Most pre-clinical cancer studies have been done in mouse models using
mouse gut microbiomes, but there are significant differences between mouse and human microbial gut
compositions. To address this anomaly, we developed a novel humanized microbiome (HuM) model to study the
response to immunotherapy in a pre-clinical mouse model of GBM. We have recently published that various
human microbiome compositions can dictate the efficacy of T-cell ICIs (anti-PD-1) in a pre-clinical GBM
model. We are the first to report that human microbiota affects T-cell ICI response in mouse models of GBM,
indicating that for patients with GBM, there may be beneficial microbes that can increase efficacy of ICIs.
Furthermore, the largest portion of immune cells in GBM are tumor associated macrophages and microglia
(TAMs). To date, no studies have examined the role of the microbiome in response to TAM targeted therapies,
such as CSF1R inhibition or anti-CD47, in GBM. In addition, the question still remains of whether the “responsive”
microbial communities in can be therapeutically exploited to rescue resistance to therapies, or if the “resistant”
microbial communities in can be depleted and/or replaced.
 We have identified “responder” or optimal human microbiome compositions, as well as “non-responder” or
resistant human microbiome compositions in our pre-clinical GBM models, which have also been confirmed in a
melanoma model. We hypothesize that responder microbiome communities promote a heightened
baseline level of anti-tumor inflammation, which helps stimulate the efficacy of immunotherapy in GBM.
Using our novel humanized microbiome mouse model, this proposal seeks to uncover the human microbial-
immune mechanisms of response to immunotherapies in GBM pre-clinical models, including T-cell (Aim
1) and TAM (Aim 2) mediated effects, and assess if responder microbiomes can be exploited and used
therapeutically. Overall, we seek to enhance our understanding of the role of human microbiota in innate and
adaptive immune-microbial interactions, and to demonstrate the translational potential of responder “optimal”
microbiomes."

BioBuilding: A traveling exhibit for future biomedical engineers
The Sciencenter, Cornell University’s Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering, and SpectrUM
Discovery Museum will develop a traveling exhibition on biomedical engineering for small to mid-sized
museums nationally. The 1,500 square-foot bilingual (English/Spanish) exhibition and supporting
programs will use hands-on learning experiences to target youth ages 6-12 and their families to foster a
greater understanding of biomedical engineering and the innovative ways it is used to address issues in
medicine, public health, and health equity. The project will be co-developed by the Sciencenter and
Cornell University graduate students, immersing Sciencenter staff in biomedical engineering content,
while strengthening graduate students’ ability to communicate their research to museum audiences.
Long-Term Objectives
1) Generate knowledge of and interest in biomedical engineering careers among rural youth ages 6-12
and their families; 2) Generate increased understanding within the general public of how biomedical
engineers improve health; 3) Encourage graduate students to continue to connect with museums
throughout their careers as a way to engage the public with important biomedical engineering content.
Specific Aims
This project supports the National Institute of Health’s strategy to “enhance the training of a workforce
to meet the nation’s biomedical, behavioral and clinical research needs” by targeting youth and families
in rural communities, communities that are often underserved in STEM. This project also aims to
improve science communication skills among participating Cornell University graduate students.
Research Design and Methods
The project will use evidence-based methods of exhibit design and inquiry-based learning to co-develop
a traveling exhibition and supporting programs with Sciencenter staff and Cornell graduate students,
which will tour nationally. Front-end evaluation and iterative prototyping with target audiences will
inform framing and entry points for biomedical engineering content. Standardized activity guides and
take-home kits will extend learning experiences into the classroom, community, and homes of visitors."

imperative for maximizing the impact of our research and education. However, the effort is compromised by
existing race and ethnicity imbalances in the field. Despite many national efforts, underrepresented minorities
(URM) experience barriers to participation in neuroscience research. In this proposed work, we will target
middle school aged youth, as these years are a critical time in youth’s identity, self-concept, and
accomplishment orientation formation processes, which will play a significant role in shaping their experience

experiences and a supportive network for URM 6th-8th grade students as they explore potential opportunities
in neuroscience. We will do this by integrating successful yet disparate single-organization practices into a
unified and longitudinal statewide model. Our proposal incorporates and expands upon our team’s past
success in (1) creating and delivering a novel neuroscience curriculum to be delivered statewide through
Minnesota in a “Train-the-Trainer” model that will create a new generation of neuroscience educators, (2)
creating and executing an immersive neuroscience summer camp for interested youth to help them begin to
take steps toward aspiration achievement that include relying on supports, navigating barriers, and
reimagining what is possible for them, and (3) developing a year-long mentorship program aimed at
diversifying the field of neuroscience through underrepresented mentors connecting and forming long-term

 Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a critical secondary messenger that modulates many cell signaling pathways
throughout physiology. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) catalytically converts ATP to cAMP in response to G protein-
coupled receptor signaling, thus acting as an essential relay and integration center for cell signaling.
Currently, ACs represent an unexploited target for treating a range of diseases including cancer, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes, heart disease, and drug abuse. Within
a cellular context, differential expression, compartmentalization, and microdomain localization of nine
transmembrane AC isoforms give rise to a broad range of possible signaling outcomes, complicating our
ability to therapeutically target this critical rheostat of cell signaling. Our mechanistic understanding of AC
function is limited, with only a recent first glimpse of a full-length AC-Gαs structure revealed by cryo-electron
microscopy (cryoEM). However, the static snapshot of AC in isolation forms an incomplete picture of the
spatiotemporal signaling that occurs in vivo. The lack of molecular and mechanistic details of AC signaling
assemblies in native environments leaves a gap in our understanding, further restricting the development
of pharmaceuticals targeting AC and cAMP pathways. To address this gap, the overarching goal of this
proposal is to capture physiologically relevant complexes between adenylyl cyclase and signaling partners
in near-native and cellular environments. This will be achieved through the following specific aims: (1)
structurally and biochemically characterize a functional signaling assembly of adenylyl cyclase, and (2)
visualize adenylyl cyclase microdomain topography and its dynamics in response to cyclase activation in
situ. Completing these aims will represent a substantial leap forward in adenylyl cyclase biology, providing
the framework for further adenylyl cyclase study. This work builds upon my G protein biochemistry
background and experience with cell signaling assays, protein purification, and fluorescence microscopy.
Taking advantage of the world-class training and resources available in the laboratory of my mentor, Dr.
Georgios Skiniotis, the proposed studies also provide an opportunity to acquire expertise in structural
biology, cryo-electron tomography, proteomic approaches, sharpen my abilities as a researcher, and
develop as an emerging leader in the adenylyl cyclase field. As a result, I will be well-positioned to establish
a program of successfully funded independent research."

Dissecting the non-growing-but-active state of a hybrid bacteria-material microdevice
Recent work has been interested in engineering commensal bacteria to address various biomedical
challenges, such as specific drug delivery, gene-editing using CRISPR-Cas, and continuous synthesis of drugs
at disease sites. In contrast to non-living devices, bacteria can address these unmet needs because they
already live in the human body and at disease sites, move actively towards stimuli, detect and respond to
stimuli, and synthesize drugs continuously. However, a significant challenge is to prevent the uncontrolled
proliferation of bacteria, while keeping their active functions. To address the challenge, the community must
have a foolproof safety measure that prevents the replication of therapeutic bacteria in any condition. This
measure will ensure that the bacteria cannot replicate in patients and the large ecosystem. Without replication,
mutation is also rare, and mutants cannot spread. Furthermore, a non-replicating entity can be dosed more
precisely than an auto-replicating entity. Thus far, however, attempts to stop bacterial replication also
compromise the therapeutic activity of bacteria. To address this critical bottleneck, my lab has created bacteria
that cannot grow but keep high metabolism by integrating synthetic materials with bacteria. The non-growing-
but-active bacteria continue to synthesize proteins, move, and respond to chemical stimuli. My research will
further investigate the underlying mechanisms that govern the non-growing-but-active state of the bacteria.
The new understanding will then be used to boost and enable specific features of the non-growing-but-active
bacteria relevant for future biomedical applications. I will leverage my prior work about synthetic gene
expression, bacterial information processing, and CRISPR-dCas9 molecular tools. The work will reveal a new
material-protein paradigm for inhibiting growth but preserving the activity of living cells. Furthermore, the work
will enable a superior, safe, and active hybrid bacteria-material microdevice for broad biomedical applications."
10898686,"Lowe Syndrome (LS) is a disease caused by mutations in the OCRL1 gene that unfortunately leads to the
early death of affected children and has no cure. However, this project aims to change such scenario. Further,
since OCRL1 mutations also cause a related renal condition known as Dent-2 (D2) disease, this proposal will
also benefit D2 patients.
 LS patients display mental retardation, ocular (e.g., glaucoma, cataracts) and renal (e.g., kidney stones,
LMW proteinuria) abnormalities, while D2 patients show renal symptoms almost exclusively. Although most
OCRL1 missense mutations found in patients alter the phosphatase domain of the encoded protein Ocrl1, about
half of these changes do not affect residues involved in binding or modification of the substrate. In fact, our
results indicate that a substantial number of patients express Ocrl1 mutated proteins with intact binding/catalytic
sequences but locked in a conformation unable to process lipid substrates. Therefore, we HYPOTHESIZE that a
subset of Ocrl1 patient mutated proteins can re-acquire functionality by action of drugs able to stabilize
the enzymatically active conformer (allosteric activators). Indeed, as a result of a series of small molecule
screens performed in our lab, we identified a group of compounds (including FDA-approved drugs) as able to
restore catalytic activity of different Ocrl1 patient mutants and to suppress a readout LS/D2 cellular phenotype.
 To test our hypothesis, 4 allosteric activator candidates will be used along with a panel of LS and D2 Ocrl1
patient mutated variants to pursue the following specific aims focused on kidney function:
 AIM 1. To determine the in vitro effect of selected candidate drugs ON THE BIOCHEMICAL ACTIVITY of a panel
of Ocrl1 LS/D2 patient mutated variants.
 AIM 2. To determine the effect of selected candidate drugs ON MULTIPLE LS PHENOTYPES observed in kidney
cell lines, kidney organoids and a zebrafish animal model bearing LS/D2 patient OCRL1 mutations.
 AIM 3. To determine the effect of selected candidate drugs ON THE STABILITY AND STRUCTURE of the Ocrl1
LS/D2 mutated variants bound or not to substrate.
 This project is INNOVATIVE because it introduces the concept of LS and D2 as heterogenous conditions with
some patients displaying a conformational/misfolding disease component and proposes a novel therapeutic
approach using allosteric activators. Importantly, this project has high SIGNIFICANCE as it will address the lack of
therapeutic approaches designed to suppress the upstream cause of a disease that affects tens of thousands of
children in the US and worldwide. Further, FDA-approved candidate drugs currently used to ameliorate other
conditions can be readily repurposed to LS/D2. Therefore, the translational IMPACT of this project is very high."

 America has an obesity epidemic, which is getting progressively worse and has immense human and
financial costs. While our understanding of homeostatic feeding circuits has advanced steadily over the past
several decades much remains unclear. In addition, much of our food consumption is not due to homeostatic
need, instead, it is often a result of non-homeostatic drivers. Cravings for sugary or fatty foods, even when
sated, drive increased consumption. Stimuli in our environment that signal food availability, including food-
associated visual cues in the form of advertisements, billboards, and candy-bar wrappers, promote these
cravings, and, ultimately, promote consumption. We aim to understand the circuits that drive feeding behavior,
including how food-associated sensory stimuli can hijack normally advantageous neural processes to increase
consumption and contribute to the obesity epidemic.
 We propose to determine the role of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons in regulating
feeding and responses to food-associated cues. MCH neurons in the lateral hypothalamus and zona incerta
project throughout the brain, including to limbic and higher-order brain regions, and can drive a diverse array of
behaviors, such as feeding, sleep, and learning. Discrete MCH subpopulations likely serve separate functions;
for example, some might promote feeding while others promote sleep or other consummatory behaviors. Our
central hypothesis is that MCH neurons will drive food consumption, increase the rewarding value of
consummatory behavior and enhance responses to food-associated cues through projections to the arcuate
nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and basolateral amygdala.
 We will first identify the activity and projection profiles of MCH neuron subpopulations that drive feeding
by mapping specific subpopulations of MCH neurons and recording their activity across a range of feeding
behaviors. We will then activate specific MCH projections to determine if they are capable of driving feeding
behaviors, in addition to other MCH-related behaviors, including sleep. We expect that a specific subpopulation
of MCH neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala will respond to food rewards
and increase consummatory behaviors. Finally, we will use in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to investigate
the role for MCH activity in forming enhanced behavioral and sensory responses to food-associated cues. By
using cutting-edge tools and approaches to identify the role for the MCH system in feeding behavior and
responses to food cues, we will generate findings that can help to identify cognitive targets and mechanisms
for treating maladaptive feeding behaviors."

Mexican American women are disproportionately affected by obesity and obesity-related conditions, such as
type 2 diabetes. Obesity and diabetes are highly concordant in Mexican American families. Given the younger
age of onset of diabetes in women with familial history, targeting mothers and their adult daughters for obesity
treatment is warranted. From a family systems perspective, family-level approaches to obesity treatment can
improve the adoption and maintenance of weight management behaviors. Including family members in
treatment may also serve as a culturally salient intervention strategy as Mexican Americans endorse high level
of familism. In contrast to traditional individual-level approaches to obesity treatment, a family-level approach
grounded in familism would promote shared goals, collaborative problem solving, and communal coping when
treating family members alongside each other. An important construct to consider when working with
intergenerational Mexican American families is differences in acculturation, which may translate into
differences in attitudes and behaviors. A wider gap in acculturation between parent and child has previously
been associated with lower family functioning (e.g., poor communication, high conflict, low cohesion).
However, interventions that promote bicultural competence by changing interactional patterns have been
effective at improving family functioning. Hence, this study will conduct a randomized control trial testing the
efficacy of a behavioral weight management intervention with brief and structured counseling on family
functioning. Mexican American mothers and adult daughters (n=118 dyads) will be randomly assigned to
receive standard behavioral treatment (SBT) or standard behavioral treatment plus relationship skills training
(SBTR). Dyads participating in SBT or SBTR will attend 24 weekly sessions focused on nutrition and physical
activity education along with behavior modification techniques. Dyads participating in SBTR will also receive
experiential-based relationship skills training that draws from both general family systems concepts and
behavioral family/couples therapy approaches to support familism, biculturalism, and communication
competencies. The 12-month trial will consist of an intervention phase (1-6 months) and a maintenance phase
(7-12 months). Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at the end of the intervention and maintenance
phases. The primary outcome is weight loss. Secondary outcomes include treatment adherence (session
attendance and self-monitoring records), physiological indicators of diabetes risk (hemoglobin A1c, waist
circumference, and body fat percentage), health behaviors (eating and physical activity), psychological well-
being (depression and perceived stress), and family functioning (subjective self-report and objective behavioral
coding). Dyads in the SBTR group are expected to achieve greater improvements in primary and secondary
outcomes than the STB group. Additionally, mediation by family functioning of intervention effects on primary
and secondary outcomes will be examined."
10867343,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mucormycosis, caused by Mucorales fungi, is a life-threatening infection that occurs in patients immunocom-
promised by diabetic ketoacidosis, neutropenia, corticosteroid use, and/or increased serum iron. Rhizopus
species are the most common cause of mucormycosis. Because of the rising prevalence of mucormycosis risk
factors, the incidence of the infection has risen. Despite disfiguring surgery and aggressive antifungal therapy,
the mortality of mucormycosis remains >40%, and approaches 100% in patients with disseminated disease.
Clearly new strategies to prevent and treat mucormycosis are needed.
Commonly initiated via inhalation of spores, clinical hallmarks of mucormycosis is the virtually uniform pres-
ence of extensive angioinvasion with resultant vessel thrombosis and tissue necrosis. These features highlight
the importance of the ability of the fungus to invade alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) to initiate the infection.
They also emphasize the significance of penetrating the endothelium during the progression and dissemination
of the disease. Finally, the extensive tissue necrosis points to the presence of fungal toxins.
During the last funding cycle, we determined that Mucorales initiate infection when the CotH invasins bind to
integrins on AECs. This binding triggers the activation of AEC epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to in-
duce invasion of germinated spores with an unidentified mechanism. We also discovered that germinated
spores disseminate through the pericytes and extracellular matrix to invade endothelial cells via CotH interact-
ing with Glucose Regulated Protein 78. We also made the seminal discovery that Mucorales damage host cells
by producing a toxin called mucoricin, so named because of its similarities to the plant toxin, ricin. Both CotH
invasins and mucoricin are required for pathogenesis and antibodies targeting either protein are protective in
mice. Specifically, our preliminary data show that the combination of binding of CotH invasins and subsequent
production of mucoricin cause disintegration of AECs (potentially by activating the ADP-ribosylation factor 6
(Arf6)), excessive vascular leak, tissue edema, and organ failure; all of which are hallmarks of mucormycosis
and are associated with antifungal therapy failure. Thus, we propose to build on these exciting data and deter-
mine the molecular mechanisms by which Mucorales induce disintegration of AECs and vascular leak and de-
fine the intracellular events of mucoricin-induced host cell entry and death. We will also evaluate the efficacy of
novel therapeutic strategies targeting Arf6, host receptors, mucoricin and mucoricin-induced host cell death
pathways in mice.
We use a mechanism-based approach to examine two hallmarks of mucormycosis: angioinvasion and tissue
necrosis. These studies will lead to novel therapies that target mucoricin, host receptors and host cell-
activation pathways. Some of these therapies are FDA-approved drugs with potential to rapidly impact treat-
ment of this lethal infection."

Racial and ethnic minorities and women have been historically under-represented in quantitative sciences. Even
within biology, diversity in quantitative sub-branches is much lower than that in experimental counterparts, with
the historical data clearly showing that the more mathematical and computational skills a discipline requires, the
fewer the enrollment of these under-represented students. The proposed training program seeks to ameliorate
these especially pronounced disparities with the biomedical sciences by establishing a streamlined bridge
between Master’s programs at Fisk University and doctoral programs at the University of Illinois, Urbana-
Champaign (UIUC). Our bridge program designed to nurture a diverse future generation of active minds
specifically in the areas of biomedical data science and quantitative biology is named FUTURE-MINDS-QB (Fisk-
UIUC Training of Under-represented Minds in Data Science and Quantitative Biology), where quantitative
biology encompasses bioinformatics, computational biology, genomic biology, and biophysics. This training
program will significantly contribute to diversifying the pool of Ph.D. researchers to include those currently under-
represented in biomedical discovery and leadership
 To achieve our goal, we will accomplish the following short-term and medium-term objectives: (a) establish
pathways for transitioning 20 Fisk M.S. students to UIUC Ph.D. programs over five years by providing ample
opportunities to strengthen their background in relevant fields and acquire core computational and mathematical
skill sets; (b) ensure the trainees’ timely Ph.D. attainment within 5 years after Master’s degree; (c) accelerate the
admission to and completion of Ph.D. programs by creating a new 4+1 M.S. track at Fisk, rigorously preparing
undergraduates for a shortened 1-year M.S degree at Fisk and successful completion of a Ph.D. degree at UIUC;
(d) create an inclusive and diverse inter-institutional environment by training both students and faculty in equity-
focused teaching, mentoring, peer interactions, rigor, reproducibility, and the responsible conduct of research;
(e) devise effective career development plans and opportunities; (f) implement a longitudinal survey of the
development of individual trainees, and disseminate an open network of current trainees, graduates, and faculty;
and, (g) make FUTURE-MINDS-QB a dynamic entity that continually improves by integrating feedback from
trainees, faculty, oversight committees, and independent evaluators. As outcomes of our training, we expect that
our seamless infrastructure and appealing inclusive environment will significantly increase the recruitment of
under-represented students to quantitative biomedical sciences and that the reinforced academic and
psychological preparation will increase the completion of doctoral degrees by under-represented students and
ultimately improve their long-term retention in biomedical sciences. We thus expect FUTURE-MINDS-QB to
establish an exemplary foundation for training under-represented graduate students and have a long-lasting
scientific and socioeconomic impact stemming from their persistence and leadership in their careers."

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced ocular hypertension (OHT) and glaucoma (GIG) occur in ~40% of the general
population and ~90% primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. Our published studies and preliminary
data show that canonical Wnt signaling activation inhibits glucocorticoid receptor signaling and GC-induced
OHT. We hypothesize that activation of canonical Wnt signaling inhibits GIG, and this inhibition requires nucle-
ar β-catenin, glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and epigenetic modification enzymes including HDAC1 and MeCP2.
Our goal is to elucidate the mechanism of GIG. Our objective is to inhibit GC-induced OHT without compromis-
ing GC’s anti-inflammatory effects. Our rationale is that Wnt activation is a potential approach to prevent and
treat OHT/GIG, and studying GIG will help us to better understand POAG. Here, we propose three specific
aims to test our central hypothesis. SA1. Explore how Wnt signaling modulates GC-induced OHT and anti-
inflammatory effects in mouse eyes. We will determine SA1.1) If canonical Wnt signaling activation inhibits
GC-induced OHT using canonical Wnt signaling reporter mice; SA1.2) If β-catenin is necessary for inhibiting
GC-induced OHT using conditional knockout mice; and SA1.3) If activated canonical Wnt signaling compro-
mises GC’s anti-inflammatory effects using mouse uveitis models. SA2. Determine the role of canonical Wnt
signaling in glucocorticoid responsiveness in human eyes. SA2.1) Determine if Dkk1 (a Wnt signaling in-
hibitor) is elevated while canonical Wnt signaling is inhibited. We will collect aqueous humor and trabecular
meshwork tissues from GIG eyes as well as from non-GIG eyes to study Dkk1, β-catenin and axin2 levels. We
expect to see higher Dkk1 levels but lower β-catenin and axin2 in GIG eyes. SA2.2) Determine if canonical
Wnt signaling affects GC responsiveness in human donor eyes. We will perfuse paired donor eyes with DEX to
identify responsiveness. For responder eyes, we will co-treat one eye with CHIR (a small molecule Wnt signal-
ing activator) and expect it will relieve OHT. For non-responder eyes, we will co-treat one eye with Dkk1 and
expect it will induce OHT. SA3. Determine the molecular mechanism of canonical Wnt signaling and β-
catenin in GC responsiveness and TM homeostasis. SA3.1) Determine Wnt signaling induced gene ex-
pression and associated chromatin accessibility in GC response. We will determine whether Wnt signaling has
differential regulation of GC-induced genes using RNA-seq and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin
with high-throughput Sequencing (ATAC-seq). SA3.2) Determine the role of β-catenin-GR/HDAC1/MeCP2 nu-
clear complex in regulating GR signaling. The components and binding pattern of this complex will be deter-
mined using Co-IP, Mass-Spec, FLIM-FRET, and ChIP-qPCR. In summary, we propose a novel approach to
remove GC side effects without compromising its therapeutic effects. The compound that we test may serve as
a lead compound in future drug development for GIG, and it would enable long-term, undisrupted use of GCs
for various eye diseases upon the success of this study."

This R21 proposal, “Repurposing L-NAC to prevent fentanyl-induced respiratory depression” seeks to expand
on our evidence that a bolus intravenous injection of the clinically-approved drug, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (L-NAC),
reverses the profound respiratory depression elicited by infusion of fentanyl in rats. The clinical effectiveness of
opioid analgesics such as fentanyl are compromised by their adverse actions on breathing and arterial blood-
gas (ABG) chemistry. Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) can be reversed by opioid receptor (OR)
antagonists but these antagonists also reverse opioid-induced analgesia We are reporting on the efficacies of
L- and D-thiolesters such as D-cysteine ethyl ester (D-CYSee) to reverse OIRD while preserving analgesia and
our current NIDA funding is allowing us to examine the efficacy of D-CYSee as a reversal agent against
fentanyl and analogues in rats (PI: Stephen Lewis, NIH/NIDA U01DA051373: Optimization of Novel Thiolesters
as a Therapeutic Strategy for Combating Opioid Overdoses and Abuse) and goats (PI: Matt Hodges, NIH/NIDA
1RF1DA050571: Reversing opioid-induced hypoxemia with thiol-based drugs without compromising analgesia
in goats). N-acetyl-L-cysteine (L-NAC), which readily enters central peripheral and cells upon systemic/oral
administration, has many beneficial effects in humans/experimental animals and is approved for human use for
numerous conditions. There are no reports that L-NAC overcomes OIRD although it is evident that L-NAC (a)
provides reducing equivalents to cells, (b) increases intracellular concentrations of L-cysteine/ L-glutathione,
and (c) exerts numerous other intracellular actions via multiple enzymatic pathways. We have begun studying
the ability of our thiol compounds to overcome the OIRD elicited by continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl
in rats. Such infusions are used widely in adult/pediatric patients but their ability to provide pain relief is greatly
compromised by their ability to depress respiration. This project will expand upon our findings that intravenous
injection of L-NAC elicits an immediate and sustained reversal of the deleterious adverse effects of continuous
fentanyl infusion on breathing and ABG chemistry in anaesthetized rats whereas it did not affect the analgesic
effects of the opioid. It appears that continuous infusion of fentanyl somehow sets up a scenario that allows for
L-NAC to modulate intracellular signaling cascades that mediate fentanyl-induced OIRD but not analgesia. Our
findings raise the possibility that L-NAC could be readily evaluated for potential reversal of OIRD elicited by the
infusion of fentanyl in human subjects. The Specific AIMS of this project are: AIM 1 – determine the efficacy of
bolus injections of L-NAC to countermand fentanyl-induced OIRD: This will establish how effectively L-NAC
reverses the deleterious effects of fentanyl infusion on breathing and ABG (but not analgesia) at early (e.g., 5
min) and prolonged (e.g., 24h) infusion times. AIM 2 – determine the efficacy of co-infusions of L-NAC to
countermand fentanyl-induced OIRD: These studies will establish the efficacy of co-infusion L-NAC to reverse
the adverse effects of fentanyl on breathing and ABG (but not analgesia) from onset of fentanyl infusion."

Candidate Goals. My career goal is to reduce breast cancer health disparities in outcomes by addressing
cancer care delivery issues in minority cancer populations. I received a solid foundation in observational
epidemiological methods which I have applied to cancer survivorship research, but my training has not
provided the skills I need to develop mHealth behavioral interventions or culturally-tailor and test behavioral
interventions. The K08 provides an ideal opportunity to develop the necessary skills to achieve my long-term
career goal as an independent clinical scientist.
Candidate Career Development Plan. In this application, I propose training to develop the skills necessary to
become a leader in the field of developing mHealth behavioral interventions for medication adherence and
other cancer care delivery issues in minority cancer survivors. Training will be obtained through participation in
scientific conferences, methods workshop, coursework, and structed mentorship from experts in developing
culturally tailored behavioral interventions (Dr. Clement Gwede), adherence to endocrine therapy among
patients with breast cancer (Dr. Dawn Hershman), mHealth methodology (Dr. Brian Gonzalez), randomized
clinical trials of behavioral interventions (Dr. Heather Jim), recruitment and retention of minority participants to
clinical studies (Dr. Susan Vadaparampil), and Biospecimen quality and testing (Dr. Shelley Tworoger). This
training will ensure that I achieve my short-term goals after which I will be uniquely positioned to bridge gaps
across disciplines, including: 1) Clinical breast cancer care, 2) Behavioral intervention development, cultural
tailoring, and testing, and 3) Using mobile health technologies and biologic specimens in studies among
vulnerable populations.
Institutional Environment. The research environment, facilities, and resources at Moffitt Cancer Center are
ideal for career development and I have the full support of my Department Chair, Dr. Czerniecki and Associate
Center Director of the Division of Population Sciences, Dr. Shelley Tworoger.
Research Plan. We propose an iterative approach to develop and pilot test a new mHealth behavioral
intervention for AET adherence that is culturally tailored to Black breast cancer survivors. We will first use
qualitative methods informed by Black breast cancer survivors to develop a blueprint of the intervention (Aim
1). We will then iteratively refine and culturally tailor the mHealth intervention focusing on symptom monitoring
and management (Aim 2). Lastly, we will test the intervention for acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary
efficacy (Aim 3). This project will address quality of life (symptom burden) and care delivery (medication
adherence) issues in a health disparity population."
10846609,"Background: VA has experience with strategies to promote guideline-concordant heart failure
(HF) care but there is a need for greater innovation. Nudge theory is a field within behavioral
science that focuses on the psychology of decision-making and offers a novel solution to improve
health care. In this proposed study, we will evaluate two nudge interventions, alerts and peer
comparison feedback, that exploit several biases which constitute the theoretical basis
supporting behavioral change.
Significance: The HF treatment gap is serious, costly, and all-too-common (low adoption of
SGLT2i and MRAs). The rates of HF guideline-directed therapy have stagnated in the VA. Our
group and others have reported that 34,000 and 21,000 deaths could be averted with optimal
implementation of SGLT2i and MRAs, respectively, in the U.S.
Innovation & Impact: We will test the effectiveness of a multicomponent nudge strategy
(alert + peer comparison) which are rarely conducted compared to single component strategies.
Only 10% of clinical-directed nudge interventions in the literature are multicomponent, and
none were identified in the VA. This study will create knowledge on how to combine these
different strategies which are needed to advance the field further and efficiently allocate VA
resources. This study targets an HF treatment gap (SGLT2 and MRA) in which no prior nudge
studies have demonstrated efficacy. This proposal utilizes an implementation science
(CDS/PRISM) approach to develop nudge strategies which is needed to ensure optimal
effectiveness, implementation, and sustainability.
Specific Aims:
1) Conduct a formative evaluation to develop two nudge strategies, an informational alert and
 peer comparison feedback, to encourage clinicians to prescribe MRA and SGLT2 inhibitors.
2) Evaluate preliminary outcomes of the two nudge strategies using the RE-AIM framework.
 a) Evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of the alert and peer comparison strategies in a
 four-group design.
 b) Evaluate the implementation outcomes of the two nudge strategies.
 i) We will report the following PRISM/RE-AIM outcomes: intervention, recipients,
 external environment, infrastructure, Reach, Adoption, and Implementation.
Methodology: This is a single-center pilot study. For Aim 1, we will conduct key stakeholder
interviews and focus groups of clinicians to assess barriers and facilitators to SGLT2 and MRA
prescribing and to refine the prototype nudges. For Aim 2, clinicians will be randomized to one
of four arms: usual care, informational alert, peer comparison feedback, and combination of
alert and peer comparison. We will compare Effectiveness, defined as new prescription of
SGLT2 or MRA within 30 days, in the three intervention versus control groups. We will also
report other outcomes including safety, Reach, Adoption, and Implementation.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will plan to test the nudge strategies in a broader trial of
multiple VAMCs using information gained from this study to inform implementation. We will
work with our partners in National Cardiology and PBM Academic Detailing to disseminate our
findings, and they will be included in periodic stakeholders’ meetings during the study."
10852948,"Neurodevelopmental disability arising from prematurity poses a large and increasing disease burden and has
increasingly been associated with cerebellar pathogenesis. Cerebellar development coincides with a critical
developmental period during which establishment of brain networks supports neurotypical outcomes. However,
the precise role of the cerebellum in supporting network structure and function through early development is
poorly understood. Developing interventions to prevent and treat neurodevelopmental disability associated with
associated with prematurity requires a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic circuit response to
functional perturbations. This proposal uses unique features of mouse development in combination with the
sophistication of mouse genetic manipulations to dynamically alter cerebellar function through a critical
developmental window while comprehensively characterizing the resulting anatomic, physiologic, and behavioral
disruptions of the associated networks. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that cerebellar function is first
required for structural establishment of brain networks while subsequently being important for ongoing function,
a dynamic that underlies the spectrum of neurodevelopmental disability. This proposal will take advantage of a
model for inducible silencing of Purkinje cell neurotransmission developed by the candidate. In Aim 1, the
experiments will test how early vs late cerebellar disruption affects behavior, predicting that early silencing will
have pervasive behavioral deficits while late silencing will produce domain specific functional deficits. In Aim 2,
the experiments are designed to examine how early vs late silencing affects the assembly and function of brain
circuits using anatomic and electrophysiologic analyses. With these aims, the proposal outlines a rigorous
approach that combines dynamic genetic perturbations, quantitative anatomic and electrophysiologic analyses,
and cross-domain behavioral assays to better understand how early cerebellar insult contributes to
neurodevelopmental disability. The candidate is a trained pediatric neurologist with extensive clinical exposure
to diagnosis and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, application and analysis of basic and advanced
imaging techniques, and research experience in model organism behavioral assays. This proposal is mentored
by Dr. Roy Sillitoe, a leader in cerebellar neuroscience who has strong track record of NIH funding, mentorship,
and scientific leadership. All experiments will be conducted at the Neurologic Research Institute, a pediatric
neurology research facility that draws on the clinical excellence of Texas Children’s Hospital and the world-class
neuroscience of Baylor College of Medicine. The professional development and training plan is designed to poise
the candidate for a career as a physician scientist focused on the prevention and treatment of
neurodevelopmental disability in the pediatric population specifically utilizing a gap based approach that
incorporates training in network analysis and advanced statistical techniques. The completion of the entailed
aims will elucidate the mechanisms by which cerebellar disruptions contribute to neurodevelopmental disability."
10861086,"Project Summary
Every year in the United States alone, an estimated 475,000 children aged 0-14 suffer a traumatic brain injury
(TBI) with more than 7,000 deaths, 60,000 hospitalizations, and 600,000 emergency department visits. Study of
this prevalent condition has led researchers to believe that sexual dimorphisms in neurodevelopment may
contribute to the observed differences in TBI severity and recovery between male and female children. However,
it remains unknown how these sexual dimorphisms influence functional neural network reorganization and
subsequent changes in cognitive, behavioral, and motor function performance post-TBI. In this proposal, we
seek to address this knowledge gap by investigating the influence of dimorphic neuroanatomy on functional
neural network recovery in our translational pediatric pig TBI model. We hypothesize innate sexual dimorphisms
in piglets will correlate with specific differences in post-TBI neural network damage and reorganization as well
as cognitive, behavioral, and motor function performance at acute, sub-acute, and chronic time points. The
contribution of this work is highly significant as successful completion of this proposal will improve the current
understanding of how sexual dimorphisms may act as a premorbid risk factor that predisposes male and female
children to differing levels of TBI severity and recovery. This study also has broad reaching implications in
understanding sex differences in other neural injuries and diseases. Finally, testing in a translational pig model
is innovative due to representative brain anatomy and TBI pathophysiology between pigs and humans, thus
improving the translational potential of study findings."
10867456,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Machine learning (ML) has seen tremendous advances in the past decade, fueled by growth in computing and
the availability of large labeled datasets. While the impact of these advances on clinical and biomedical
research are potentially significant, these applications face unique challenges due to the difficulty in acquiring
labels from biomedical experts. Furthermore, ML algorithms often fail to generalize across institutions or
datasets due to measurement biases (e.g. MR scanners) or intrinsic demographic or biological differences
between cohorts / datasets which limits their impact in biomedical science. This proposal will develop new
methodology and open-source software that biomedical data scientists can use with their applications to 1.
Improve data labeling by identifying the best samples for labeling that provide the most benefit for training ML
algorithms; 2. Improve generalization of ML models across institutes; and 3. Perform this work on scalable
cloud platforms. We will first explore how to improve upon methods known as active learning that interactively
construct labeled datasets by having an algorithm select samples that address its weaknesses and present
these samples to an expert for labeling. We will then investigate how these samples can be selected to
improve the performance of ML algorithms across multiple institutions by learning robust patterns that are not
specific to any one site. Finally, we will develop an extendable software framework that developers can
integrate into their own applications to take advantage of these methods, and that can operate on cloud
platforms to support scalable analysis of large datasets. This work will be developed through a combination of
simulation studies using a unique repository of over 280,000 human markups of digital pathology images at
multiple institutions, and also user studies of the developed software frameworks focused on applications in
perinatal pathology and the human placenta. The software tools will impact a broad variety of biomedical
applications beyond pathology where data labeling and multi-institutional studies remain challenging."
10871896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Every year in this country 40,000 patients are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive
and terminal disease caused by excessive extracellular matrix production by myofibroblasts in distributed
lesions, or “fibrotic foci”, throughout the lung. Despite the availability of two FDA-approved drugs that are
considered standard of care, the mortality rate for IPF patients exceeds 30% at four years, and there are no
drugs that halt disease progression, making diagnosis with IPF a death sentence for over 500,000 Americans
living with this disease. Identifying the cells of origin that give rise to myofibroblasts is necessary for finding
treatments that can halt or cure IPF. Based on experimental data and computational simulations from our
research team, we hypothesize that myofibroblasts arise from microvascular pericytes (cells that normally
enwrap capillaries) when heterotypic pericyte-endothelial interactions become disrupted. We further posit that
strategic modulation of kinase-mediated signaling in pericytes can prevent pericyte-to-myofibroblast transitions
and halt the progression of IPF. We propose to combine computational modeling with experiments to study
pericyte-to-myofibroblast differentiation and to investigate how microvessel adaptations in the lung contribute
to IPF. Specifically, we will develop a new agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates logic-based intracellular
signaling networks to simulate cell behaviors and leverages Bayesian inference for rule refinement (Aim 1),
validate the ABM's ability to predict pericyte phenotype transitions and the emergence of fibrotic foci in
response to drugs using the murine bleomycin model of IPF (Aim 2), and bridge murine experiments with
clinical data in order to predict how druggable kinase-driven signaling pathways affect IPF progression via
modulation of pericytes and microvessels (Aim 3). To our knowledge, our proposed studies will be the first to
combine computational modeling with experiments to study microvascular contributors to IPF progression. In
addition to producing a new computational model that is validated for bridging pre-clinical study results to
clinical outcomes, we expect to identify new therapeutic approaches for IPF that target microvascular cells,
previously underexplored but potentially critical contributors to this deadly disease."

 The long-term goal of this project is to improve the neurological health of patients with diabetes by
decreasing the severity and incidence of cerebral ischemia. Stroke and heart disease are the most serious
complications of diabetes, accounting for more than 84% of the mortality. Epidemiological studies of cerebral
ischemia suggest that diabetes increases its incidence and exacerbates the consequences of cerebral ischemia,
with one of the main contributing factors being hyperglycemia. In clinical studies, intensive anti-diabetic therapy
was able to delay the onset and slow progression of secondary complications of diabetes. The major side-effect
of intensive anti-diabetic therapy is hypoglycemia. Recurrent hypoglycemia (RH) episodes are common among
type 1 and type 2 patients receiving intensive therapy. Thus, the goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of
prior exposure to hypoglycemia on the risk of stroke/thrombosis, delineate underlying mechanisms, and
understand the mechanism by which hypoglycemia exacerbates cerebral ischemic damage using insulin-treated
diabetic (ITD) rats. Using an in vivo model of thrombosis, we observed that ITD rats with prior exposure to RH
develop significantly larger thrombi compared to the controls. We also observed that platelets from RH-exposed
ITD rats are more sensitive to an aggregation stimulus. Unbiased RNA-seq analysis, subsequent real-time PCR,
and immunoblotting experiments demonstrate increased levels of phospholipase c γ-1 (PLCγ1), a member of
phosphoinositide-specific PLCs that plays an important role in platelet activation via intracellular calcium
signaling, in platelets harvested from RH-exposed ITD rats. We also observed that exposure of ITD rats to RH
leads to pronounced post-cerebral ischemic hypoperfusion. Post-ischemic platelet activation may be responsible
for post-cerebral ischemic perfusion deficits. In view of these, we hypothesize that prior exposure to RH
increases the risk of cerebral ischemia and exacerbates post-cerebral ischemia hypoperfusion by
platelet dysfunction. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine the
minimum frequency of RH exposure required to increase the risk of thrombosis (a surrogate for stroke risk) in
ITD rats as well as the duration of this effect. Aim 2: Evaluate the mechanism by which prior exposure of ITD
rats to RH increases the risk of thrombosis. Aim 3: Evaluate the role of platelet dysfunction in exacerbated
ischemic brain damage in RH-exposed ITD rats. We expect these studies to provide insight into the mechanism
by which prior exposure to RH increases cerebral ischemia risk and post-cerebral ischemic damage in patients
with diabetes in order to help lower their risk of cerebral ischemia."
10933407,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the third leading cause of blindness in the US and one of the leading
causes of blindness worldwide. Initially, dry AMD results from inflammation caused by excess reactive oxygen
species (ROS), and has no cure. When it progresses to wet AMD, the disease is characterized by abnormal
growth of leaky blood vessels caused by excess expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which
permanently damages the retina and causes severe vision loss. Anti-VEGF therapeutics are the current standard
treatment for wet AMD. However, the requirement of frequent intravitreal injections is associated with high
treatment costs, patient burden, and risk of complications including pain. This also does not address the
inflammatory component of early stages of the disease. There is a clinical need to reduce injection frequency
and treat underlying inflammation causing the disease. The overall objective of this project is to develop and
validate an injectable, biodegradable, stimuli-responsive nanoparticle delivery system that can sustain release
of a new therapeutic to treat inflammation for several months. In Aim 1, an investigational therapeutic will be
synthesized and characterized. Stimuli-responsive polydopamine nanoparticles that release more therapeutic in
the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) will be synthesized and loaded with the new therapeutic.
Therapeutic and nanoparticles will be evaluated for in vitro cellular uptake in human retinal pigment epithelial
cells using flow cytometry. Short-term biocompatibility of both the therapeutic and nanoparticles will be evaluated
in vivo in a mouse model over 2 weeks. In Aim 2, in vivo biocompatibility and efficacy of the proposed treatments
will be evaluated in the sodium iodate mouse model of dry AMD over 2 months. Structural and functional
assessments of the eye will include intraocular pressure, fundus imaging, spectral domain optical coherence
tomography, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Biocompatibility and biodegradation will be assessed
concurrently. Therapeutic concentrations in ocular tissues will be validated by ELISA after 2 months. ELISA will
also be used to evaluate retinal expression levels of HO-1 in the disease model to investigate the mechanism of
action of the proposed therapeutic. These aims will evaluate a ROS-responsive drug delivery system to sustain
release of an anti-inflammatory therapeutic in the eye. This has potential to treat underlying disease pathways
associated with AMD and reduce intravitreal injections, improving the quality of life for patients with AMD and
other ocular or inflammatory diseases."
10836426,"Open angle glaucoma (OAG) is a group of progressive optic neuropathies that can lead to blindness. It is a
serious health issue among minorities and veterans who are disproportionately affected by the disease.
 OAG pathology involves increased IOP which is the result of reduced outflow facility of the aqueous humor.
High IOP increases the risk for both development and progression of glaucomatous neurodegeneration and
functional loss. Although current therapies of OAG are directed at lowering IOP, few if any target the site of
pathology in the outflow tissues or increase outflow facility.
 Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a serine protease that has an important role in outflow facility
regulation. We have shown that tPA is reduced in steroid-induced IOP elevation and that outflow facility is
reduced in tPA (PLAT)-null animals. Furthermore, exogenous supplementation of tPA reverses outflow facility
reduction and IOP elevation in both steroid-induced glaucoma as well as in tPA null animals. We have also
surprisingly shown that tPA and enzymatically inactive tPA (EI-tPA) can improve outflow facility in human
mutant myocilin transgenic animals.
 We propose here to determine the efficacy and safety of using tPA and EI-tPA as a long-term treatment for
OAG, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which tPA causes its effect on outflow facility.
 Our hypothesis is that overexpression of EI-tPA in the outflow tissues is safe and effective in the treatment
of OAG and results in preservation of vision. Furthermore, we hypothesize that EI-tPA causes matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) upregulation through the Low-density lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein (LRP)
receptors and Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) signaling. To test this hypothesis, we propose the
following specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: Determine whether chronic treatment with tPA or EI-tPA can be used to treat glaucoma
and prevent functional damage from the disease.
 Specific Aim 2: Determine whether chronic treatment with tPA or EI-tPA causes retinal or other eye
toxicity or has adverse effects on function.
 Specific Aim 3: Determine whether LRP mediated ERK activation is responsible for the tPA induced
MMP9 upregulation in vivo.
 The proposed studies will allow us to better understand the mechanisms of outflow facility regulation by
tPA and determine whether an enzymatically inactive variant can be used for chronic therapy of OAG to
prevent functional visual loss from the disease. It is thus expected to significantly contribute to the health and
well-being of veterans who are known to be disproportionately affected from glaucoma"
10909023,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Placental abruption is a life-threatening pregnancy complication where the placenta completely or partially
separates from the uterus before the birth of the baby. Abruption complicates 1 to 2% of all births; two-thirds
are classified as severe based on associated maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Numerous studies
suggest that abruption is a culmination of early ischemic pathology involving blood coagulation and
inflammation. However, disease onset and mechanisms involved in its progression into abruption are poorly
understood and constitute an important gap in knowledge. A well-recognized barrier is that human placental
tissue cannot be obtained until pregnancy is over, making early pathology and its progression challenging to
investigate. Our preliminary data demonstrate that mice deficient in Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR), an
endogenous inhibitor of blood coagulation, exhibit decidual blood clots that progress into placental abruption.
We have discovered that this process requires thrombin receptor Par4 and is accompanied by infiltration of
leukocytes and evidence of their acute inflammatory reaction involving (1) release of myeloperoxidase (MPO),
an enzyme that generates toxic oxidants, and (2) histone citrullination, a posttranslational modification of
histones that changes chromatin structure and drives inflammation. Importantly, our data shows that MPO-
release and citrullination of histones also occur in human placental abruption, supporting the relevance of our
findings. Taken together, these new findings suggest that activation of the blood clotting cascade results in
recruitment of immune cells to the decidua, and that their ensuing inflammatory response mediates placental
abruption. The long-term goal of this research is to identify cellular and molecular components of this
coagulation-inflammation crosstalk in the setting of maternal thrombophilia, and to identify potential therapeutic
targets to inhibit progression into placental abruption. The objective of this application is to test the hypothesis
that onset of decidual blood clots and progression into placental abruption requires thrombin receptor
activation, recruitment of MPO-expressing leukocytes and activation of their downstream mechanism of injury.
Specific aim 1 will identify and phenotype altered immune cell populations in the decidua, and their trafficking
to and from the decidua during onset and development of placental abruption. Specific aim 2 will dissect the
roles of coagulation components and the vascular endothelium in onset and progression to placental abruption.
Specific aim 3 will identify mediators of inflammation in the pathogenesis of placental abruption with particular
emphasis on the roles of neutrophils and MPO, and their destructive cycle of oxidative stress and chronic
inflammation. The expected outcome is a comprehensive understanding of immune cells that are recruited to
the decidua in the context of activated coagulation and identification of their downstream mechanisms of injury.
This work will have a positive impact by unraveling the mechanisms mediating coagulation-associated
abruption and will likely have implications for a broader set of placental complications."

Molecular chirality is at the heart of many chemical processes that determine life and drives significant research
in development and disease. All life has chiral asymmetry with naturally occurring molecules and long-range
assemblies being of distinct handedness. Many exogenous molecules, for example those useful as drugs, also
have a distinct enantiomeric dependence for their efficacy in benefiting human health. Thus, measurement of
molecular chirality is of critical importance across the medical sciences. Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD)
spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful platform for quantifying chirality and molecular structure. However,
imaging has not been demonstrated due to technological challenges. VCD measurements are largely of
homogeneous materials, neat or in solution and probed with sensitive Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectrometers. Microscopy would require ~105 reduction of the typical sensing volume and increase in speed
that would make imaging feasible. Instead of utilizing FT-IR spectroscopy, we built a custom quantum cascade
laser (QCL) microscope to demonstrate feasibility of a point scanning VCD instrument capable of acquiring
spectra rapidly across all fingerprint region wavelengths in both transflection and transmission configurations.
Moreover, for the first time, we also demonstrate the VCD imaging performance of our instrument for site-specific
chirality mapping of biological tissue samples. However, the feasibility data also point to several technological
and conceptual challenges that this project seeks to address in developing a practical prototype. The prototype
to be developed here, termed vibrational circular dichroism imaging microscope or VIM, aims to record chirality
from microscopically heterogeneous biomedical samples. We propose a design for VIM using a laser scanning
approach to minimize artifacts and maximize signal. Starting from a de novo design, we will use commercial and
custom optics, custom electronics for control and data management, and in-house software to develop the
prototype. Next, we model the VCD image formation process and develop the analytical methods for VIM. The
theoretical model developed here builds on our models of IR microscopy and will guide prototype development
while ultimately provide greater accuracy, precision and assurance to data recorded. Finally, we validate the
performance and broad utility of VIM using well-characterized samples. Together, the work will develop new
VCD imaging technology that opens capability to measure and research a wide variety of biological problems."

Mutation is the source of all evolutionary novelty and diversity shaping both the structure and sequence of
genomes. Over evolutionary timescales changes to genome structure and content are associated with vast
phenotypic changes between and within species. Throughout the lifetime of an organism individual cells
accumulate somatic mutations that can also confer selective advantages. Our lab is interested in how
mutations emerge and how these changes to genome sequence and structure are maintained and acted on by
selection. We seek to understand at both the cellular and organismal level how cell-type, genotype, selective
pressures, and evolutionary histories influence the structure and sequence of the genome. Ultimately, our
research will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying why specific cell types are more
susceptible to disease as well as how genome structure influences phenotypic diversity within and between
species. Patterns of somatic mutation have been extensively studied in the context of cancer tumor genomes
in which clonal expansions amplify the signals of mutation to detectable levels. Far less is understood however
about how “normal” cells accumulate mutations through time and how these dynamics are influenced by
factors such as cell type and genotype. Furthermore, somatic mutations have proven challenging to identify
due to the comparably high error rate of standard sequencing approaches. We propose to use novel genomic
methods to investigate how different forms of somatic mutation accumulate and how somatic mutational
processes are impacted by inherited genetic variation. In addition to discerning the contexts in which individual
cells accumulate mutations, we propose to determine how genome structures have evolved in the context of
different evolutionary histories, selective pressures, and life history strategies. While the size and structure of
eukaryotic genomes varies tremendously spanning three orders of magnitude in vertebrates, the evolutionary
and mechanistic bases of this variation remain unknown. We propose to study the evolution of genome
architectures in the explosive adaptive radiation of rockfish to understand how extreme variation in lifespan can
impact mutational processes and genetic diversity. We further propose to study how the structures of human
and chimpanzee genomes have been shaped by local adaptations and the forces of selection. Identifying
signatures of selection and adaption at structurally variable (SV) loci has been challenging in part due the
tendency of SVs to emerge in complex repetitive regions of the genome. We propose to use long-read based
genomics approaches and novel computational methods to assess these loci. Ultimately, our research will
further our understanding of mutation, diversity, and genome structural diversity both within and between
species as well as among the individual cells of organisms."
10879033,"Project summary
 The overarching goal of my lab is to understand understudied mechanisms of genomic regulation, and how
they influence lifelong Vertebrate health and disease. In multi-cellular organisms, diverse cell types are
characterized by specific genomic regulation patterns, and the precise control of these patterns is key not only
for development, but also for cell/tissue homeostasis in adults. Indeed, loss of fine control in genomic regulation
has been linked to disease (e.g. cancer, neurodegeneration) and age-related functional decline. An interesting
and understudied family of genomic elements lies in dormant genetic parasites (e.g. transposons, also called
“jumping genes”). Although transposons can represent up to 80% of some eukaryotic genomes, they remain
critically understudied, since they were historically dismissed as unimportant (i.e. “junk DNA”), and their high
copy numbers and repetitive nature pose unique technical challenges. Consistent with their potential impact in
health and disease, the ability of cells to suppress transposon activity is disrupted with disease and with aging.
In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that many aspects of biology and genomic regulation differ between
males and females, including emerging data suggesting potential sex-dimorphism in transposon activity.
However, how transposable elements are regulated throughout life in healthy somatic tissues and
across biological sexes, and how they influence vertebrate health, remains largely unknown. Thus, we
propose to decipher how transposons are controlled in healthy somatic cells (including in male vs. female cells),
and how loss of that control could influence Vertebrate health and disease. To explore this question, my group
will use a unique combination of ‘omics’ approaches, machine-learning, and experimental validation in animal
models. We use two vertebrate models for their respective strengths: the laboratory mouse (e.g. powerful
genetics, validated antibodies, etc.) and the African turquoise killifish, a naturally short-lived model organism I
have helped develop (e.g. short generation time/lifespan, strain diversity, cost-effectiveness, etc.). First, we will
decipher sex-dimorphic regulation of transposon activity, determining the impact of gonadal hormones vs. sex-
chromosomes on such regulation. Second, we will use functional genomics to identify new regulators of
transposon activity in somatic cells. Finally, we will evaluate the impact of transposon control in key somatic
tissues and across sexes on lifelong vertebrate health using the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish as
a model. Ultimately, understanding the fine control of transposon in healthy cells will help devise strategies to
prevent their misregulation in disease, by allowing us to maintain youthful and healthy genomic regulation
landscapes.

10873827,"SUMMARY
In metazoan embryos, maternal and zygotic factors collaborate to establish gene regulatory domains, regions of
the nucleus in which participating genes are coordinately regulated, and these domains are maintained
throughout development. To successfully establish domains, transcription factors must effectively locate the
appropriate region of the nucleus, perform the correct function within the context of the domain, and contribute
to the active maintenance of the domain as the zygote develops. Our overall goal is to determine how nuclear
domains are regulated throughout development. Defining the signals that direct domain targeting will allow us to
further decipher the cis regulatory code: how proteins interact with cognate sequences in a cell, leading to
differentiation and disease.
 We will pursue this goal using the Drosophila histone locus, a highly repetitive region composed of over
100 tandem gene arrays that attract both general and unique transcription factors, forming the histone locus
body (HLB) domain. We recently described some of the earliest interactions between histone locus cis
sequences and transcription factors that initiate domain formation, but how transcription factors collaborate to
establish and maintain a domain is not well defined. In addition, DNA sequence is not sufficient to determine
transcription factor function within a domain. Rather, factors must integrate multiple sources of information
outside of sequence, including genomic context, chromatin cues such as histone marks, and three dimensional
locus organization, to perform correct context-specific functions.
 It is challenging to capture the steps that lead to nuclear domain initiation for three reasons: 1) Many key
events take place in the very early embryo which has few cells and therefore little biological material with which
to work; 2) Maternally deposited transcription factors are loaded into the egg and are difficult to deplete; and 3)
It is not possible to use reporter transgenes before activation of the zygotic genome. However, by using an
ectopic histone gene array, which is still targeted for domain formation, we can manipulate signals residing in
the locus that lead to transcription factor recruitment. In my new laboratory, we are using this system, the
extensive repertoire of genetic tools in Drosophila melanogaster, and creative approaches to overcome these
challenges and address important gaps in our understanding of nuclear domain formation during embryogenesis.
We will define the epigenetic mechanisms that initiate nuclear domains and determine how transcription factors
integrate multiple levels of genomic information to perform domain-specific functions. Our work is significant
because our observations will provide insight into the regulation and organization of other repetitive regions,
such as the ribosomal RNA genes, as well as for non-genic regions such as telomeres and centromeres."
10876460,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Species are conventionally defined as groups of individuals that breed with each other and produce
fertile offspring, but not with those of other species (according to Ernst Mayr's Biological Species Concept).
However, it is difficult to apply this eukaryotic definition of species to microbes because, even if they reproduce
clonally, DNA may be acquired between strains and between species. Genetic recombination allows a
bacterial cell to acquire novel traits through incorporation of DNA fragments from other organisms into its own
genome. Recombination influences a myriad of evolutionary and population processes, including levels of
standing diversity, niche expansion, spread of resistance and virulence determinants, and rapid adaptive
changes in response to new or fluctuating environmental conditions. These processes are fundamental to
questions critical to society and public health, such as whether an emerging disease is caused by a new
species or variants of existing ones, what factors make a strain resistant or transmissible, and how a pathogen
will respond to clinical interventions and host immune system. It is often assumed that all strains recombine at
a uniform frequency and randomly across the entire species. However, recent work from the PI's lab show that
recombination rates of strains of the same species vary along a continuum spanning several orders of
magnitude, with a unique pattern of exchange for different strains and lineages. The causes and
consequences of within-species variation in recombination is poorly understood, and therefore we still lack a
coherent model for genome evolution that incorporates this variation. Filling in this gap in our knowledge of
recombination has important ramifications for understanding species formation in microbes and the
mechanisms that keep them separate once they begin to diverge. The goal of our proposed research is to
elucidate how variation in recombination rates between strains impact population structure, genome evolution
and speciation in microbes. Using a combination of comparative population genomics, laboratory experiments
and mathematical modeling, we will answer the following questions: (1) To what extent does the probability of
recombination influenced by the genetic distance and ecology of the parental strains? (2) How do different
modes and genetic units of recombination vary across a species? (3) What are the evolutionary consequences
of variable recombination rates in genome structure and divergence? Output from this research will help
address the fundamental question in microbiology of whether species exist and if so, what processes keep
them separate and distinct. The proposed research will also be a significant step forward to developing an
evolution-based taxonomical framework and species boundaries for microbes. The results of the studies
proposed in this application are expected to lead to other opportunities for fruitful cross-disciplinary research at
the boundary of evolutionary biology, microbial genetics, computational biology and epidemiology."
10861791,"The leading cause of death in diabetic patients is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our long-term goal is
to identify new therapeutic targets for the prevention of CVD in diabetic patients. In the first grant cycle, we
identified the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3) as a potential mediator of diabetes-associated
cardiovascular disease via a non-biased transcriptomics approach. In the second grant cycle, we found that
FMO3 exerted many of its effects via the key metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO); we further found the
endoplasmic reticulum stress kinase, PERK, to be a receptor for TMAO.
 Multiple clinical studies have now shown that TMAO is increased with insulin resistance, as well as
atherosclerosis, confirming that this pathway is dysregulated in humans, and suggesting that inhibition of the
FMO3/TMAO pathway may have beneficial effects. TMAO is synthesized from the metabolite trimethylamine
(TMA), which is in turn produced by the gut microbes. Therefore, an attractive strategy would be to inhibit the
production of TMA by the gut microbes. In our unpublished, preliminary data, we screened a drug repurposing
library. The advantage of using repurposed drugs is that they are already known to be safe in humans, reducing
the time and expense needed to bring them into the clinic. We identified a compound that inhibits the microbial
enzyme that generates TMA and can lower TMAO levels in mice.
 The goals of the current cycle are to fill the key remaining gaps in our mechanistic understanding of the
TMAO pathway, and to test the therapeutic potential of lowering TMAO. We hypothesize that TMAO, which is
increased with diabetes, induces PERK to promote dyslipidemia, inflammation and diabetes-associated
atherosclerosis. Our aims are to elucidate the mechanisms by which PERK promotes metabolic dysfunction; to
determine the extent to which hepatic deletion of PERK can prevent TMAO-induced dyslipidemia, inflammation
and atherosclerosis; and to test whether the novel compound identified in our drug repurposing screen can
prevent diabetes-induced atherosclerosis in mice. We expect that these studies will lead to a novel, orthogonal
approach to reducing CVD risk in patients with diabetes."
10881666,"Older adults make a large proportion of sepsis patients. Organ dysfunction is common in patients with
severe sepsis, and old septic patients often have more severe organ injury and longer-lasting organ
dysfunction. However, the mechanism underlying exacerbated organ injury/dysfunction in old septic
patients remain unclear. This proposal tests the central hypothesis that aging enhances and prolongs
inflammation to exacerbate organ injury and to impede the recovery of organ function following sepsis.
The central hypothesis is based on our novel findings in preliminary studies using an animal model of
sepsis. Specifically, we observed that old mice display enhanced and prolonged inflammation, as well as
more severe cardiac and renal dysfunction, mimicking the clinical manifestations of old septic patients.
Aging-related deficiency in anti-aging protein Klotho in the myocardium and kidney tissue is responsible
for the augmented inflammation, and such altered inflammation occupies a major role in organ injury and
dysfunction. Further, sepsis induces the over-production of pro-inflammatory mediator FGF23, and
Klotho has a novel function in down-regulation of FGF23 production and its pro-inflammatory activity.
More importantly, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-37 up-regulates Klotho expression in old mice and
protects against organ dysfunction and mortality in sepsis.
We will pursue two interrelated Specific Aims to test the hypothesis that aging impedes the recovery of
organ function following sepsis by prolonging inflammation and to explore therapeutic approaches for
promotion of organ recovery from injury caused by sepsis. Proposed studies will address the role of
aging-related Klotho deficiency in the mechanism underlying the augmented inflammation and
exacerbated organ injury/dysfunction in old septic mice and will elucidate the mechanism by which
FGF23 augments inflammation. Further, the proposed studies will explore the therapeutic potential of
recombinant Klotho and IL-37 for protection of organs against injury/dysfunction.
Overall, the proposed studies will provide insights into the mechanisms underlying exacerbated organ
injury/dysfunction in old septic subjects and offer preclinical information for development of novel
therapeutic approaches for down-regulation inflamm-aging to protect organs in old people affected by
sepsis."
10871863,"Project Summary/Abstract: Aberrant activation of RAS signaling is a major driver of lung cancer resulting from
gain-in-function mutations in RAS genes often caused by tobacco-derived carcinogens. Constitutive activation
of RAS, a GTPase, stimulates a cascade of downstream kinases to activate genes encoding for proteins
essential for multiple aspects of tumorigenesis, including tumor cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis.
Because KRAS is mutated during early stages of lung cancer and a major driver of tumor promotion and
progression, a direct-acting, reversible, small molecule inhibitor of activated RAS holds great potential for lung
cancer chemoprevention or the treatment of individuals with early stage disease. Unfortunately, previous
attempts to develop RAS inhibitors were unsuccessful, in part, because of the scarcity of sites on the protein
amenable to small-molecule binding. However, ongoing clinical trials of two covalent inhibitors of the relatively
rare KRAS G12C mutation have validated this approach that can be expanded to inhibitors effective for a much
broader spectrum of RAS mutations prevalent in lung cancer patients and other RAS-driven malignancies. A
long-running medicinal chemistry program undertaking the synthesis of a focused library of indenes and
screening in a cell-based assay for RAS selectivity resulted in the discovery of a novel class of RAS inhibitors.
MCI-062 emerged as a lead compound following extensive chemical optimization and iterative target-directed
screening. In vitro treatment of lung cancer cells harboring mutant RAS with MCI-062 inhibited growth with IC50
values as low as 2 nM, while human normal airway epithelial cells or tumor cells with low levels of activated RAS
were essentially insensitive. MCI-062 was effective regardless of the RAS isozyme or mutational codon and
appreciably more potent than covalent mutant-specific inhibitors of KRAS in clinical trials. Multiple lines of
evidence indicate that MCI-062 inhibits tumor cell growth by directly interacting with RAS to inhibit GTP binding,
blocking RAS-effector interaction, suppressing RAF/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling, resulting in selective
apoptosis of RAS mutant tumor cells. As proof-of-concept, MCI-062 and a prototype prodrug, MCI-316, inhibited
tumor growth in vivo, although further chemical optimization is needed to develop an oral formulation suitable for
preclinical development. A new prodrug, MCI-1004 recently emerged from ongoing synthetic efforts with
attractive drug-like properties that merit in vivo testing. We propose aims to: 1) gain further insight into how MCI-
062 selectively inhibits the growth of lung cancer cells with activated RAS; 2) synthesize new analogs and
prodrugs to improve antitumor activity by oral delivery and benchmark them against MCI-1004, and 3) evaluate
antineoplastic activity of MCI-1004 and a second prodrug lead in mouse models of lung cancer chemoprevention
and treatment that are relevant to the clinic. The aims are structured to be conducted in parallel and designed to
be translational with the goals of optimizing and selecting a drug development candidate for IND-enabling safety
assessment and to gain a mechanistic rationale for biomarkers that will aid in selecting patient cohorts for future
clinical trials."
10911150,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertension is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality from stroke, myocardial infarction, heart
failure, and chronic kidney disease amongst the United States Veterans. Despite the importance of
blood pressure control, the pathogenesis of essential hypertension remains poorly understood.
Recently, a new observation has shed light onto potential dendritic cells (DCs) that may be involved in
human hypertension. Using single-cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing, a new subset of DCs has
been described with surface expression of Axl and Siglec-6 in normal health subjects. They showed
that Axl+ Siglec-6+ DCs (AS DCs) can potently drive T cell proliferation and produce large amounts of
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Based on previously published studies and preliminary data, I propose that
hypertension leads to the release of endothelial-derived growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6) that activates
Axl on DCs leading to inflammation and its associated end organ damage. In Aim 1, I will test the
hypothesis that hypertensive stimuli lead to GAS6/Axl-dependent inflammasome activation mediated
by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AS DCs. In this aim, I will expose human CD14+ monocytes to
GAS6 or hypertensive endothelial cell stretch and assess inflammasome activation, ROS production,
and the formation of the highly reactive Isolevuglandin (isoLG)-adducts by flow cytometry. I will also
examine the role of isoLGs on inflammasome activation by scavenging isoLGs using 2-
hydroxybenzilamine (2-HOBA) during exposure of human monocytes to hypertensive stimuli and
assess cytokine production by flow cytometry. Lastly, I will examine the response of AS DCs from
normotensive and hypertensive human subjects in an unbiased fashion by cellular indexing of
transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq). I predict that scavenging ROS and/or isoLGs
during exposure of GAS6 or endothelial cell stretch will prevent inflammasome activation and pro-
inflammatory cytokine release by AS DCs. In Aim 2, I will test the hypothesis that Axl-dependent
signaling in DCs promotes hypertension and its associated end-organ damage. I will use mice in which
I have deleted Axl specifically in DCs (Axlfl/fl and AxlCD11cCre). I will examine the in vivo role of Axl in DCs
during hypertension by radiotelemetry and flow cytometry. Next, I will investigate the deletion of Axl in
DCs on inflammasome activation and T cell proliferation in vitro by flow cytometry. I predict that genetic
deletion of Axl will prevent hypertension, DC activation, and its associated inflammation. In Aim 3, I will
test the hypothesis that GAS6 promotes DC activation, hypertension, and its associated inflammation
I will use mice that have genetic deletion for GAS6 (GAS6WT/WT and GAS6-/-). I will examine the in vivo
role of GAS6 by performing bone marrow transplantation studies and assess DC activation and
development of hypertension by flow cytometry and radiotelemetry. I will genetically delete GAS6 from
human endothelial cells and assess DC activation status and cytokine production by flow cytometry. I
predict that genetic deletion of GAS6 will prevent hypertension and activation of immune cells. These
studies will advance our understanding of the role DCs play in the development of human hypertension
and will provide new therapeutic directions for the treatment of human cardiovascular disease for United
States Veterans."
10841013,"A Pipeline for Research, Education and Mentoring in Reproductive Aging
Decline in female fertility is one of the earliest age-related deteriorations seen in humans, often decades before
signs of somatic aging appear. From a fertility perspective, women are considered geriatric by late 30s and
only ~5% experience successful natural pregnancies in their 40s. Besides fertility, menopause triggers a
spectrum of negative health outcomes including increased susceptibility to cognitive decline and
cardiovascular disease. Increased human life expectancy coupled to global trends of delayed child-bearing
means that reproductive fitness is not only important for womens’ health, life- and career- choices, but has
inescapable societal, economic and public-health implications. An expanding body of evidence reveals that
reproductive senescence and somatic aging are mechanistically intimately linked. In the last two decades,
support from the NIA, and others, has led to innumerable discoveries in organismal aging from basic
mechanisms to potential anti-aging therapeutics. However, reproductive aging remains under-studied and its
public-health significance poorly acknowledged. To develop an intellectual workforce well equipped to meet the
current and future challenges of an aging population, it is critical to urgently prioritize the intersection of aging
and reproduction as a focus of research, education and biomedical programs.
Dr. Ghazi proposes to address this need through this K07 Academic Leadership Career award, by establishing
a Pipeline for Reproductive-Aging Research, Education & Mentorship (PRAM) that spans the
undergraduate-to-faculty spectrum at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). The central goal of this application is to
create a program that will help establish Pitt as a world leader in reproductive aging. The K07 leadership award
will help attain this goal by facilitating the development of a ‘pipeline’ at the university for (a) Early Recruitment
(Aim 1): attract students from early academic stages towards reproductive-aging research, (b) Exceptional
Education (Aim 2): organize a strong educational curriculum focused on reproductive health and aging, and (c)
Sustained Mentorship (Aim 3): provide personalized, long-term mentorship and community support for
researchers in this area at every career stage. Dr. Ghazi is uniquely positioned to lead this initiative because of
her long-standing research expertise in aging, reproduction and their intersection, her academic leadership
experience and commitment to education and mentoring. Pitt is an ideal institution for this initiative because of
the presence of highly-regarded centers specifically dedicated to research on aging and reproductive health,
an exemplary research and funding record, and a large, diverse pool of undergraduate, graduate and medical
students. Pitt-PRAM will help establish reproductive aging as a core institutional objective at Pitt and serve as
a roadmap to build an exceptionally trained Reproductive Geroscience workforce of the future."
10815856,"Project Summary/Abstract: My overall goal is to improve the health and well-being of individuals with
comorbid opioid misuse/opioid use disorder (OUD) and chronic pain across varied settings and populations.
Research on the management of comorbid opioid misuse/OUD and chronic pain is being outpaced by the
clinical need across populations and settings. Additionally, there is no well-worn training pathway to conduct
research in this area, few mid-career and senior investigators have the expertise to mentor early-career
investigators in this space, and the need for mentoring to grow the workforce is enormous. Finally, given the
known racial health disparities in our field, it is especially important that researchers are representative of the
populations they serve, which is currently not the case. I am a physician and PhD-trained behavioral scientist
who treats individuals with opioid misuse/OUD and chronic pain. I have a consistent track record of NIH-funded
research and productive mentoring at the intersection of these conditions across populations and settings
including HIV, cancer, and primary care, and am at an institution with exceptional resources to support
trainees. This K24 mid-career investigator award will allow me to grow the workforce at the intersection of
opioid misuse/OUD and chronic pain by 1) expanding my capacity to mentor PhD students, postdoctoral
scholars, and faculty from diverse disciplines—and allow me to continue to focus on women and individuals
from backgrounds that are underrepresented in science—in research on comorbid opioid misuse/OUD and
chronic pain; 2) Become a leader in implementation science approaches to studying treatment of comorbid
opioid misuse/OUD and chronic pain, including hybrid trials; and 3) Develop the skills needed to systematically
incorporate health equity considerations and research methods throughout my work. I have assembled a team
of advisors with whom I have created a comprehensive career development plan including didactic
coursework, experiential learning, and conference attendance that will allow me to excel at achieving these
goals. Additionally, this K24 proposes a new research project that leverages existing Delphi-based preliminary
data to 1) Develop an implementation strategy bundle to promote the adoption and equitable application of
evidence-based approaches for managing opioid misuse/OUD and metastatic cancer-related pain, and 2)
Conduct a hybrid type 2 pilot trial of the evidence-based approaches and implementation strategy bundle.
Findings from this study will lead to a hybrid type 2 randomized trial of the implementation strategy bundle and
ultimately improved care for patients with opioid misuse/OUD and metastatic cancer. This and other NIH-
funded studies in my portfolio will provide mentees ample opportunity to propose mentored research projects.
This mentored research experience, combined with a program of tailored career development opportunities,
will develop a new cadre of independent investigators at the intersection of opioid misuse/OUD and chronic

10845299,"Abstract
Pediatric clinical trials are needed to improve the medicines and treatments available for children and
adolescents that are actually tested with youth rather than adults. However, recruitment barriers exist
including: not understanding the importance of clinical trials, fear of procedures and unknown in research,
mistrust in the research process, lack of knowledge about procedures, and worries about risks. Parents play an
important role in the decision about whether their child can participate in a pediatric clinical trial. Parents
need to be educated about clinical trials so that they can make an informed decision about participation and
effectively communicate with their child about the research opportunity. Although there exists websites and
YouTube videos that provide information on pediatric clinical trials, none of these resources provide parents
with skills or strategies to use when communicating with others and participating in shared decision-making.
Existing multimedia programs appear to only impact knowledge; however, changing attitudes and self-efficacy
to make decisions about clinical trials are also important factors that can influence parents’ willingness to allow
their child to participate in a clinical trial. With this R21, we aim to fill the gap in available resources for parents
by creating an
(English/Spanish language)
web-based parent toolkit for parents of children (ages 7-17), which
will provide information about clinical trials as well as provide opportunities for parents to practice and build
communication, information-gathering, and shared decision-making skills. It is hypothesized that by using the
web-based parent toolkit, parents will report an increase in their knowledge, positive attitudes, self-efficacy,
and willingness to participate in clinical trials, as well as decrease in mistrust and fear. In Year 1, we develop
the parent toolkit using a user/human-centered approach with feedback from multiple Advisory Panels of
parents (diverse in terms of ethnicity, race, gender, child age, and trust in research) and
Latino/a/x community
group members
, as well as toolkit review by expert consultants. The toolkit will be optimized for use on
computers, mobile devices, and tablets, and tested for Section 508 compliance, thus increasing the accessibility
and usability of the web-based toolkit. In Year 2, we will conduct a feasibility study with a sample of parents (N
= 150), who will complete self-report measures about their knowledge, attitudes, fears, self-efficacy, and
willingness to allow their child to participate in a clinical trial, as well as a consumer satisfaction questionnaire
to provide feedback on the toolkit. The results of the R21 will lay the foundation for the development of web-
based toolkit for parents that takes into account the perspectives of parents who are low in trust and familiarity
with clinical trials as well as parents that are diverse in ethnicity, race, gender, and age of their child. The
ultimate goal of this toolkit will be to increase the number of children and adolescents who are permitted to
participate in clinical studies, which is needed to improve treatments for pediatric illnesses and diseases."
10841604,"Title: Development of personalized healthy food incentives to improve diet and cardiovascular risk
ABSTRACT
It is imperative to address the complex factors that drive food decisions and promote unhealthy dietary
patterns. This mentored career award will support a rigorous training and research plan that will apply mixed
methods to promote healthier grocery purchases and improve dietary intake and cardiovascular (CV) health.
Through strong mentorship and training opportunities, I will adapt and test the novel automated machine-
learning based Smart Cart 2.0 platform to deliver personalized recommendations and incentives for healthier
grocery purchases among Rhode Island adults with CV risk factors (i.e., Body Mass Index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2
and/or hypertension). To date, interdisciplinary research from my Big Data and Eating Decisions lab has
focused on investigating determinants of food choice and diet quality in large population cohorts and using
those insights to develop dietary interventions. I previously developed and pilot tested a semi-automated
personalized healthy food incentive platform using decision tree logic and found that it significantly improved
grocery purchase quality among healthy adults in the 9-month randomized controlled Smart Cart Study. The
proposed project extends this research by using novel applications of grocery sales data to adapt and evaluate
the automated `Smart Cart 2.0' platform to encourage healthier food purchases and dietary quality. To adapt
and scale this platform to adults at high CV risk, it is essential to understand its's feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary effectiveness to facilitate adoption of a healthier diet among adults with CV risk factors. This project
also advances methodology to leverage technology and machine learning to automatically evaluate sales data
and deliver personalized dietary recommendations in real time. The proposed research will use the Obesity-
Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) framework to determine whether the Smart Cart 2.0 platform
adapted and tested with input from adults with CV risk factors promotes a clinically significant change in diet
quality and CV risk factors. In Aim 1, I will evaluate how well the Smart Cart 2.0 content and function meet the
needs of adults at CV risk using focus groups and surveys. In Aim 2, I will conduct a 1-week 3-arm mock
shopping trial in a simulated online grocery store to see how much the platform affects willingness to purchase
(WTP) recommended foods relative to control using a discrete choice task comparing a) personalized
recommendations b) personalized recommendations plus incentives to c) generic education and incentives
(control). In Aim 3, I will conduct a pilot 6-month randomized controlled trial to test the acceptability, feasibility,
and preliminary effectiveness of the Smart Cart 2.0 platform for improving real-world dietary behaviors, diet
quality, BMI, and blood pressure. Results of this project will provide critical pilot data to support a larger
randomized controlled trial. The training plan and collaborations established through this award will position me
to pioneer a policy-relevant translational research program focused on promoting healthier dietary patterns and
CV health."
10892225,"This submission comprises two applications (Clinical and Statistical Data Coordinating Centers). We propose
to conduct a large (N=1,100), simple, pragmatic, superiority trial in the US - IMPROVE-AD – comparing a
strategy of medical therapy (MT) plus upfront thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) to MT plus
surveillance for deterioration in patients with uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (uTBAD). Surveillance will
include clinically indicated TEVAR and/or open repair performed for deterioration during index hospitalization
or follow up. This is the first trial of this size designed to establish guidance on uTBAD management. The trial
leadership is comprised of an experienced group of investigators in a Clinical Coordination Center (CCC; Duke
Clinical Research Institute, Durham, NC, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, and University of
Washington, Seattle, WA) a Statistical and Data Coordination Center (SDCC; Duke Clinical Research Institute,
Durham, NC) and a diverse, Executive and Steering Committee of experts in the field representing clinicians,
trialists, and patient advocates. Aortic dissection (AD) is the most common fatal event involving the aorta
occurring in 5 to 30 cases per million of population resulting in 12,000 deaths in the US annually. Type B aortic
dissections involve the entire descending aorta. Based on evidence from the 1960s, the main strategy for
uTBAD is medical therapy with lifelong surveillance. This strategy has been shown to have poor long-term
outcome in 25-50% of patients (aortic related events). The emergence of TEVAR as a less invasive alternative
to open repair, however, has resulted in debate over the use of upfront TEVAR to treat uTBAD. A pilot
European trial (INSTEAD) compared the outcomes of upfront TEVAR to optimal medical therapy in 140
patients with uTBAD. Despite being significantly underpowered for all-cause mortality, the findings, along with
observational data suggest that medical therapy plus upfront TEVAR may be associated with decreased all-
cause and aortic-related mortality. We have also demonstrated from our completed surveys that there is
equipoise among practitioners with respect to the most appropriate treatment strategy in uTBAD. We propose
a pragmatic trial with centralized, telephone follow-up, remote blood pressure monitoring, a clinically relevant
hierarchical primary endpoint (mortality / aortic-related hospitalization), and multi-disciplinary teams of
investigators and patient advocates. The trial duration is 84 months with 5-month start-up. Average follow-up
is 4 year with a minimum of 2.5 years and maximum of 6 years for individuals enrolled early. IMPROVE-AD will
have 88% power to detect a 25% relative reduction in the incidence of the primary endpoint for patients
randomized to upfront MT plus TEVAR compared to MT plus surveillance for deterioration, assuming a 5 year
cumulative incidence of 20% death and 20% aortic-related hospitalization in the MT plus surveillance for
deterioration arm."

Although benzodiazepines (BZs) are considered to be among the safest prescription drugs in modern
medicine, their utility is constrained by a number of side effects, including the liability for tolerance and
dependence. The overall goal of this application is to investigate the extent to which GABAA receptor subtypes
are differentially involved in tolerance and physical dependence associated with acute and long-term BZ
exposure. This renewal application builds on research implicating unique roles for α1, α2, α3, and α5 subunit-
containing GABAA receptors (α1GABAA, α2GABAA, α3GABAA α5GABAA receptors, respectively) in BZ-
induced tolerance and dependence. During our previous Project Period, we obtained several important
findings: (1) tolerance develops rapidly to behavioral effects associated with α1GABAA receptors, but not
α2/3GABAA receptors; (2) the ability of BZ-type drugs to induce physical dependence involves α1GABAA
receptors; but (3) new evidence has suggested a unique inhibitory role for other GABAA subtype(s) in physical
dependence. Together, these findings form the framework for our working hypothesis that α1GABAA receptors
are key mediators of both tolerance and physical dependence associated with exposure to BZ-type drugs,
whereas physical dependence may be mitigated by α2GABAA and/or α3GABAA subtypes. In Specific Aim 1,
we will evaluate the hypothesis that α1GABAA subtypes are key mediators of acute and chronic physical
dependence, as well as tolerance, induced by BZs. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the hypotheses that
α2/3GABAA receptors play a unique “protective” role of preventing withdrawal, with no tolerance to the effects
mediated by these subtypes. We also will explore a novel potential role for α5GABAA subtypes as facilitators
of tolerance. The research in this renewal application addresses a key gap in knowledge by systematically
exploring the role that GABAA receptor subtypes play in tolerance and dependence associated with BZ-type
drugs, an area of research that has received relatively little attention. Because tolerance and physical
dependence are significant barriers to use of BZs as effective therapeutics, the research in this application will
inform drug discovery strategies for developing improved therapeutics with reduced dependence/abuse
potential."

People who inject drugs (PWID) are at exceedingly high risk of HIV compared to the general population, yet
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programs that target them in the U.S. are scarce and accordingly PrEP
uptake in this population remains low. In recent years, substance use services have been scaled up to address
overdose among PWID, however, they remain an underutilized entry point into PrEP. Pivotal gains made in
reducing HIV could be rapidly eroded by the expanding population of PWID attributed to the ongoing opioid
epidemic, new HIV outbreaks among new injectors, and the emergent COVID-19 pandemic, which has
disrupted key HIV prevention services including syringe services programs, treatment and condom distribution.
The overarching aim of the RADAR (Rapid Alerts through Drug Analysis and Response) study is to design,
implement and evaluate a mobile health van that provides on-site PrEP, peer navigation and co-located drug
checking services (DCS). This study will expand the reach of PrEP services by offering a novel intervention
designed to increase PrEP awareness and engagement. DCS enable PWID to understand the precise
chemical contents of their drugs to inform safer drug practices and are critical in places where illicit fentanyl
drives overdose mortality. The integration of peer navigation will help attend to the multiple, pressing needs of
PWID and subsequently enhance their engagement in the PrEP continuum. Our specific aims are: (1) to
develop a community-level, mobile, integrated PrEP intervention aimed to increase PWID engagement in the
PrEP care continuum; (2) to implement the intervention through a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial and
evaluate its impact on being on PrEP or having seen a PrEP provider in the last six months among PWID
(N=600) over the course of 18 months; (2a) to measure the intervention’s impact on HIV risk behaviors (e.g.,
syringe sharing, condomless sex); and (3) to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention in
terms of HIV cases averted among PWID (N=600) over the course of 18 months. The intervention (on-site
PrEP, peer navigation, SMS reminders, DCS and associated risk reduction counseling, standard-of-care
services) will be compared to the standard-of-care only (HIV testing, PrEP referrals, fentanyl test strips,
naloxone) condition. The proposal is directly responsive to PAR-18-915’s aim to leverage implementation
science to improve each step of the Seek, Test, Treat, and Retain (STTR) continuum for PWUD as well
broader NIH priorities to reduce HIV incidence and develop, test, and implement strategies to improve HIV
testing and entry into prevention and care. The study is innovative as it attends to multiple comorbidities, it is
inclusive of the expertise of PWID in all components of the study and builds on our experience in delivering
outreach services during COVID-19."
10782002,"Bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is characterized by a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota low in Lactobacillus species,
affects nearly 30% of U.S. women; the majority (55%) are asymptomatic (aBV). Guidelines currently
recommend testing and treatment only for symptomatic BV (sBV). BV (a composite variable with aBV and
symptomatic BV [sBV]) has been associated with an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
and HIV acquisition. Although studies to distinguish the differential risk of incident STI or HIV between women
with aBV and sBV have not been published, preliminary data from our group suggests that aBV is strongly
associated with incident STI and a published pilot study of BV suppressive therapy in women with aBV
indicated a decrease in chlamydia cases. To date, enthusiasm for research on or clinical treatment of aBV has
been limited, primarily by lack of data on aBV risks and perceptions of low efficacy of currently available BV
treatments. However, while BV treatment is challenging, approximately 50% of women with sBV taking
currently available therapies do achieve lasting cure. Moreover, novel, more effective therapies for BV are on
the horizon: a recent high-profile randomized trial of Lactin V, a L. crispatus intravaginal live biotherapeutic
product, showed reduced BV recurrence13. As new, better treatments for sBV become available, it is critical to
determine whether women with aBV should also be treated, in order to prevent sequelae such as STI or HIV
acquisition. If the vaginal microenvironment is shown to be identical in women with sBV and aBV, this will be
an important initial step demonstrating that aBV is a condition that should not be ignored, and will galvanize
further studies to define aBV, STI and HIV risk, and advance treatment. In a large epidemiologic study of over
300 women, our specific aims are to assess whether women with aBV and sBV differ in two broad areas (1)
biobehavioral factors and (2) the vaginal microenvironment, including factors associated with HIV and STI
acquisition risk (vaginal microbiota, key metabolites and soluble mediators of inflammation). This is a
secondary analysis leveraging existing data from a previously funded study (NIAID R01-AI116799, PI:
Brotman) for which 16S rRNA gene amplicon, metabolomic, and immunologic profiles have already been
generated from cervicovaginal lavage samples collected in the NIH's Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora.
Information gained through this proposed study will provide foundational data to better define aBV, and to
determine whether future studies to define the risk of HIV and STI acquisition associated with aBV, or studies
of aBV treatment as a method to prevent HIV and STIs are needed. This resubmission application is in
response to a program announcement (PAR-20-291) which is designed for Exploratory and Developmental
Research Grant Program for NIAID K-award Recipients. It will provide career development for the PI to
transition to research independence with a highly feasible and valuable clinical research project focused on the
vaginal microbiome and women's health."

Following injury to the optic nerve in mammals, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) cannot regenerate their axons and
soon undergo apoptotic cell death, leading to permanent vision loss. Some degree of optic nerve regeneration
can be induced experimentally but the extent of regeneration achieved to date remains away from the level of
visual functional recovery required, pointing to the need for more effective therapies. Aside from testing well
established growth factors and chance discoveries of several novel factors, a more systematic screening of as
yet untested ligands to the many trophic factor and chemokine receptors that are expressed in adult RGCs could
augment regeneration well beyond currently achievable levels. In recent genetic studies (RNA-Seq, FACS-
purified cells), we have obtained an extensive list of growth factor, chemokine and peptide receptors that are
expressed in adult RGCs, many of whose ligands have not been tested for effects on axon regeneration and
RGC protection. To carry out the screening, we will use an adult RGC culture system and in vivo optic nerve
regeneration models that have been used on our lab for 2 decades, and which have enabled us identify three
previously unknown potent factors for optic nerve regeneration. The proposed studies will screen the ligands to
the multiple receptors that are expressed in adult RGCs to discover novel factors for optic nerve regeneration
and RGC survival. With significantly improved automated cell culture system, Aim 1 will carry out an in vitro
bioactivity screen and verify hits in vivo, respectively. Aim 2 will screen which subtypes of RGCs are responding
to the known effective treatments and the new hits from Aim 1. This will enable us develop combinatorial
treatments to stimulate axon regeneration from multiple RGC subtypes simultaneously. Through these studies,
we expect to promote considerably greater levels of axon growth than can be attained currently and ultimately
bring us closer to improving visual function after optic nerve damage."

After decades of using implantable neural probes with implantable multielectrode arrays for medical studies,
the exact failure mechanisms of these implants still remain to be fully understood. However, more and more
studies have shown that minimizing the mismatches between the soft biological tissue and bioelectronic
devices would be a key to achieving long-term, accurate, real-time, and large-scale neural recordings and
stimulations without inflammatory immune responses. To mitigate the mechanical mismatch found in hard
metal or silicon probes, soft neural probes that are both flexible and stretchable have been developed in
recent years. However, bioelectronics on current soft probes has fundamental limits in the stability of their
electrochemical impedance under physiological conditions, resulting in a compromise between electronic
performance and mechanical matching. The long-term goal is to create a next-generation brain-computer
interface (BCI) for advancement in biology, neuroscience, biomedical engineering, and regenerative
medicine. The overall objective of this application is to elucidate the design rules to enable electronic-tissue
interfaces with reliable electrochemical impedance, tunable mechanical stiffness, using an approach that
combines two unique material types – nontoxic liquid metals and biocompatible elastomers. The central
hypothesis is that a combination of low-melting-point nontoxic gallium-based liquid metals and intrinsically
stretchable polymers will synergistically enhance the electrical, and mechanical interfacial properties in the
biological environment and provide unified interfaces for multifunctional integrated systems with embodied
intelligence. The successful completion of this research will result in significant advances in the methodology
of liquid-metal-embedded soft neural probes. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that the
successful development of a truly stretchable and reliable probe-tissue interface offers neuroscientists an
unprecedented platform technology to design specific neural probes to investigate fundamental life science
questions that were unexplorable before, such as “how neuronal circuits are formed during brain
development” where high-density high-resolution stretchable neural probes are needed as a mammalian
brain may grow more than 100% in size and add vast amounts of new tissue and resulting new functions.
The proposed research is innovative, because it departs from both the conventional and existing
neuroscientific instrumentations and introduces a new framework for next-generation neural probe systems
using low-melting-point metals and soft polymers. The proposed research is transformative because it will
enable “invisible” brain-computer interfaces (BCI) to provide fundamental insights into the underlying
physics of brain circuitry formation and functionality. Ultimately, such knowledge paves the way for us to
understand the brain and ourselves better, offers new opportunities for finding the origin of intelligence, and
invites new solutions for the development of innovative therapies to treat brain disorders."

 Our goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which mitral regurgitation (MR) creates substrates for arrhythmias,
both atrial and ventricular, and to identify targeted interventions. Valvular heart disease is the most common
etiology of chronic atrial fibrillation (AF). Prospective, randomized trials have shown that surgical ablation is
highly effective in restoring normal sinus rhythm in patients with mitral valve disease and there is clear evidence
that it provides a survival benefit. Newer studies have shown that ventricular remodeling and arrhythmias
following MR increase the risk of sudden cardiac death, especially in young women.
 In the previous cycle of the grant, we refined a canine open chest model of MR via chordae avulsion previously
developed in our laboratory into a minimally invasive model that better mirrors the clinical picture. In our clinical
practice, we treat MR patient with and without AF, and are able to characterize their cardiac anatomy and
electrophysiology with delayed-enhancement MRI (DE-MRI) and electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI),
respectively
 We propose to characterize the remodeling of the atria and ventricles following MR in our canine chordae
avulsion model and in patients. As our preliminary data suggest an inflammatory-mediated mechanism, we will
identify patterns of immune cell infiltration that correspond to anatomical and electrophysiological changes to
facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies. We propose the following specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1. Define the anatomical and electrical substrates for AF and ventricular arrhythmias in a chronic
canine model of MR. The anatomical substrate will be characterized using echocardiography and DE-MRI, the
electrical substrate using in-vivo plaque mapping, optical mapping, and ECGI. We will obtain activation maps of
the heart, including the most arrhythmogenic parts of the atria (the LAPW) and the ventricles (periannular region
and papillary muscles) and correlate them with fibrosis as defined by DE-MRI. Specific Aim 2. In our canine MR
model, we will determine if inflammatory leukocyte infiltration precedes remodeling following MR induction and
whether its presence corresponds to changes in electrophysiology. We will perform single nuclear RNA (snRNA)
analysis of the LAPW and correlate it with LAPW electrophysiology characterized in thin slices at baseline, 4
weeks, and 6 months after MR induction. In the ventricle, snRNA analysis of the mitral periannular region and
papillary muscles at the same time points will be correlated with local electrophysiology. Specific Aim 3. Define
the atrial and ventricular electrophysiological remodeling in MR patients with and without AF referred for surgery.
ECGI will be used to detect changes in the atrial and ventricular activation sequences and to detect premature
ventricular contractions. Electrical remodeling will be correlated with fibrosis and fiber orientation as well as atrial
and ventricular volumes as determined by DE-MRI."

Low back pain is one of the most common disabling conditions in the world. The worldwide point prevalence of
activity-limiting (acute and chronic) low back pain is approximately 12%, which equates to approximately 933
million people globally suffering with low back pain at any given time. Chronic low back pain (cLBP) refers to
pain lasting at least twelve weeks or longer, and it is consistently among the top five most common reasons for
primary care physician visits. Although some individuals with cLBP have clear pathoanatomic causes of pain,
the vast majority of cLBP is “non-specific” and is not accompanied by readily identifiable pathology of the spine
or related tissues. Without a clear target for treatment of cLBP, effective pain management can be difficult to
achieve. Because objective measures of disease activity have not consistently been strong predictors of clinical
symptoms, cLBP provides an excellent model for investigating the influence of social determinants such as racial
background and social stress on the progression of pain and disability over time. During our previous funding
cycle, we found evidence that non-Hispanic Black (NHB) individuals with cLBP reported significantly greater pain
severity and disability than their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. In addition, we observed racial
differences in pain-related psychosocial and biological measures, which were significantly associated with racial
group disparities in cLBP severity. Furthermore, racial disparities in cLBP were exacerbated by low
socioeconomic status (SES), such that NHBs with low SES demonstrated the absolute greatest burden of cLBP.
While our findings demonstrate clear racial differences in cLBP severity and disability between NHBs and NHWs,
the findings are largely indirect and cross-sectional. Differences in how cLBP progresses over time between
NHBs and NHWs, as well as factors that contribute to cLBP progression, remain poorly understood. Among the
multiple factors that inevitably contribute to racial group differences in cLBP, social stress represents a potentially
important social determinant of greater cLBP severity and disability in NHBs. For this proposed follow-up study,
we will elucidate the contribution of social stress and its biological consequences (i.e., allostatic load) to racial
group disparities in cLBP by prospectively assessing the two-year progression of clinical pain and disability, as
well as pain-relevant psychosocial functioning among NHBs and NHWs with cLBP. We will use minority stress
theory to guide the study aims related to the progression of racial group disparities in cLBP; however, we will
also use a recently developed resilience framework to guide inclusion of psychosocial resilience factors that may
mitigate the effects of social stress on cLBP in NHBs and/or NHWs."

Alcohol abuse and alcohol-related diseases are a major medical burden in industrialized countries. Chronic
alcoholism is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota, increases in intestinal permeability, and
elevated systemic levels of bacterial products. We demonstrated that Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is
sufficient to cause mild steatotic liver disease and to exacerbate ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. We
identified cytolysin, a two-subunit exotoxin secreted by E. faecalis, to cause hepatocyte death and liver injury.
Compared with controls, patients with alcohol use disorder or alcoholic hepatitis have increased fecal numbers
of E. faecalis. The presence of cytolysin-positive (cytolytic) E. faecalis correlated with liver disease severity and
mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. How chronic alcohol use results in increased intestinal and hepatic
numbers of cytolysin-positive E. faecalis is not known. Results from our laboratory suggest that increased
intestinal numbers of E. faecalis are facilitated by changes in the intestinal glycocalyx and in particular by
reduced (1,2)-fucosylation of glycoproteins on the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. Alcohol-
mediated suppression of Fucosyltransferase 2 (Fut2) allows intestinal colonization and bacterial translocation
of E. faecalis. Furthermore, translocated E. faecalis is phagocytosed and eliminated by the complement
receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily (CRIg) on Kupffer cells. Patients with chronic alcoholic hepatitis
have lower hepatic CRIg expression, which reduces E. faecalis elimination, prolongs exposure to E. faecalis
and increases liver damage. Thus, ethanol associated changes in intestinal colonization and hepatic
elimination of E. faecalis promotes alcohol-related liver disease. Our experimental approach is to use mouse
models of ethanol feeding to investigate the role of Fut2 in limiting intestinal colonization of E. faecalis and
reducing liver disease (Aim 1). We will also assess the functional contribution of the phagocytic protein CRIg to
E. faecalis elimination and to liver disease (Aim 2). New strategies will be tested to prevent and ameliorate
ethanol-induced liver disease in preclinical models. We believe these studies will provide novel insights into the
contribution of the microbiota to alcohol-related liver disease."

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cell therapy has revolutionized treatment for certain B cell
malignancies, but similar successes for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have not yet been shown, although interim
results of early phase clinical trials, including our own, are promising. We have constructed a CAR that targets
the type III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) called FLT3. Utilizing a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of
FLT3(+) human AML, we have shown that infusion of human FLT3-CAR T cells prolonged survival of AML-
bearing mice in the absence of other therapies. Further, FLT3-CAR T cells did not affect engraftment or survival
of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mice bearing AML. The effectiveness of FLT3-CAR T cell therapy in AML
will depend on (1) surface antigen density of FLT3 on AML blasts, including leukemic stem cells (LSC) relative
to normal HSCs, and (2) the ability of other immune effector cells to contribute to the eradication of AML in vivo.
To this end, we have discovered that treatment of AML blasts with an RTK inhibitor (TKI) upregulates the
expression of FLT3 on the AML blast and the LSC in vivo, relative to FLT3 expression on normal HSCs. To
advance a second cellular therapeutic intervention for AML, we have expressed the FLT3-CAR in human natural
killer (NK) cells to generate FLT3-CAR NK cells, which demonstrated potent anti-leukemic activity against
FLT3(+) AML. Collectively, these discoveries have led us to conclude that a program directed against FLT3(+)
AML has strong rationale, is innovative and could result in a significant decline in mortality for a subset of AML
patients. Therefore, the long-term objective of this proposal is to perform both preclinical and clinical studies
that will best define an optimal strategy to reduce mortality from AML with FLT3-CAR cellular therapy, either
alone or in combination with TKIs. Our central hypothesis is that targeting relapsed/refractory FLT3(+) AML
with FLT3-CAR T cells or FLT3-CAR NK cells in combination with TKIs will improve outcomes in AML. In this
proposal, we will assess the feasibility, safety and toxicity of performing a phase I study of human FLT3-CAR T
cell therapy directed against FLT3(+) AML (Aim 1), we will determine the mechanism by which TKIs upregulate
the surface density expression of FLT3 on LSCs and HSCs (Aim 2), and we will optimize a FLT3-CAR NK cell
platform and assess its functionality against AML alone or combined with TKI (Aim 3). To accomplish these
objectives, we have begun clinical manufacturing of FLT3-CAR T cells to treat eligible patients with refractory or
relapsed AML; we will utilize both human AML cell lines and patients' AML blasts in vitro as well as in vivo along
with our PDX model for our correlative and preclinical studies evaluating FLT3-CAR T and FLT3-CAR NK cells
in combination with TKI. Upon conclusion, we will understand how best to optimize cellular immune therapy to
cure AML. Further insight into this process, as will result from the implementation and completion of this proposal
is impactful as it will ultimately lead to a reduction in mortality for select patients suffering from AML."

Sepsis is a clinical syndrome that complicates severe infection. Sepsis remains the leading cause of morbidity
and mortality in critically ill patients. There are no specific FDA-approved medicines for the treatment of sepsis.
Current concepts of the pathophysiology of sepsis suggest that inappropriate regulation of neutrophil functions
contribute to organ failure and mortality in sepsis. This manifests as an inability to control bacterial growth and
dissemination, persistent and secondary infections, inflammation, and end organ injury. Extracellular adenosine
is a biologically active signaling molecule that accumulates at sites of metabolic stress in sepsis. Extracellular
adenosine has potent immunosuppressive effects by binding to and activating G protein-coupled A2A adenosine
receptors (ARs) on the surface of neutrophils. A2AAR signaling reproduces many of the phenotypic changes in
neutrophils that are characteristic of sepsis, including decreased chemotaxis, diminished ability to ingest and kill
bacteria and delayed apoptosis. Given this similarity between septic neutrophil alterations and the ones caused
by A2AAR signaling, we hypothesized that endogenous adenosine would contribute to the sepsis-induced onset
of neutrophil dysfunction via stimulation of A2AARs. Our preliminary data using both targeted genetic deletion
and pharmacological antagonism in mice with cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis have confirmed that
A2AARs contribute to bacterial dissemination, organ injury, and mortality. Our data with human patients
demonstrate increased plasma adenosine and neutrophil A2AAR expression indicating increased A2AAR
signaling leading to neutrophil dysfunction. Based on these data, we hypothesize that endogenous adenosine
contributes to sepsis-induced immune dysregulation, bacterial dissemination, organ injury and mortality through
A2AAR signaling in neutrophils. To address this hypothesis, we propose 2 Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will
delineate the role of A2AAR signaling in neutrophils in contributing to bacterial dissemination, organ injury, and
mortality in CLP-induced sepsis in mice. Specific Aim 2 will study the contribution of A2AAR signaling to neutrophil
dysfunction in patients with sepsis. The long-term goal of this study is to pharmacologically target A2AAR signaling
as a treatment option for the management of patients with sepsis."

Little is known about structure-function relationships in the human placenta. As pathologists, we can view
the placenta only after delivery, and correlate our findings to clinical and prenatal course, as well as
neonatal outcome. At best, however, we have lesions which correlate with disease, but have yet to be
validated, either directly, through molecular analysis, or indirectly, through manipulation and functional
analysis of in vitro models. Placental dysfunction, manifested clinically as preeclampsia (PE) with or
without fetal growth restriction (FGR), is associated with histopathologic lesions of maternal vascular
malperfusion (MVM) and fetal vascular malperfusion (FVM). These lesions differentially affect the three
trophoblast compartments: cytotrophoblast (CTB, the putative stem cell), syncytiotrophoblast (STB, the
cell type responsible for gas/nutrient exchange), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT, the invasive cell type
at the maternal-fetal interface). Nevertheless, our understanding of these lesions is limited to morphology
and immunolocalization of a few markers. Over the past few years, multiple groups, including ours, have
used scRNAseq to characterize cellular heterogeneity within both normal and diseased placentae;
however, these studies remain mostly descriptive, lacking both spatial context of the molecular data and
functional evaluation of the distinct cell types. We therefore propose to apply novel technologies, including
digital spatial profiling (DSP) and tissue decellularization followed by extracellular matrix (ECM)-specific
mass spectrometry, as discovery-based approaches to better characterize specific MVM and FVM lesions
at the molecular level. We will then use primary term CTB, to reproducibly model these phenotypes and
to perform functional validation as part of a targeted evaluation approach. We will test the hypothesis that
late gestation CTB respond to specific cell- and ECM-derived signals to proliferate and/or differentiate into
either STB or EVT, thus identifying potential regenerative capacity in this unique transient organ.
We will also probe the cellular and ECM origins of PE-associated placental dysfunction, testing the
hypothesis that this disease originates from alterations in ECM composition and paracrine signaling from
both placental and decidual (maternal) cells. Successful completion of this proposal will establish a
detailed cellular and matrix atlas of the human placenta, with validated structure-function
relationships, laying the groundwork for probing placental regenerative capacity in the setting of
placental dysfunction."
10874490,"Significance: The racial and ethnic distribution of the cancer workforce contrasts starkly with that of the
general population. Only 2-3% of oncologists identify as Black or Latinx, compared to 13% and 18% of the U.S.
population, respectively. While evidence from the business literature suggests that diversity in teams impacts
organizational performance, it is not known whether provider team diversity as well as patient-provider racial
and ethnic concordance is associated with quality of cancer-related care and outcomes. If the diversity of teams
(physician patient-sharing networks) does indeed improve cancer care, this benefit could improve care for all
patients, regardless of the individual patient's race or ethnicity or the race or ethnicity of their provider.
Objective: Our over-arching goal is to generate actionable evidence to inform efforts to improve cancer
workforce diversity and increase equity in cancer care. Our hypothesis is that the racial and ethnic
representation of the oncology workforce varies across regions and patient-sharing networks and that this
variation is associated with clinical care. Previously, addressing this knowledge gap has not been possible due
to a lack of available data combining physician race and ethnicity with patient clinical data. Specific Aims:

mutations at one of the 15 genes encoding histone H3, most frequently at either H3F3A or HIST1H3B gene, are
found in 80% of DIPG tumors, replacing histone H3 lysine 27 with methionine (H3K27M). H3F3A and HIST1H3
encode histone H3 variant H3.3 and canonical H3.1, respectively. Of these “H3K27M tumors”, about 80% and
20% are H3.3K27M and H3.1K27M, respectively. Furthermore, H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M DIPG tumors show
distinct gene expression signatures and are associated with distinct driver genetic mutations. Recently, it has
been shown that DIPG cells interact with surrounding neurons, which promote the proliferation and invasion of
DIPG cells. However, it is largely unknown how the unique gene expression pattern of H3.1K27M DIPG is
regulated to promote tumorigenesis and the interactions between tumor cells and neurons. We hypothesize that
chromatin regulators control the unique gene expression pattern and tumor-neuron interactions in H3.1K27M
DIPG tumors. To test this hypothesis, we performed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify chromatin regulators that
when depleted specifically reduce the fitness of H3.1K27M, but not H3.3K27M DIPG cells. Through this effort,
we discovered CHD2, a member of the CHD family chromatin remodelers. CHD2 is known for its role in gene
regulation and nucleosome assembly of H3.3, and its dysregulation is linked to cancer and neurological
syndromes. However, its roles in H3.1K27M DIPG were unexpected. We found that CHD2 depletion reduces
the expression of genes involved in axon guidance and neurogenesis in H3.1K27M, but not H3.3K27M DIPG
cells. Furthermore, CHD2 depletion in H3.1K27M cells resulted in increased H3K27me3 and reduced H3K27
acetylation (H3K27ac). Based on these exciting results, we propose to elucidate molecular mechanisms
underlying the unique dependence of H3,1K27M DIPG cells on CHD2, and test the hypotheses that CHD2
regulates the expression of genes in these cells for their interaction with neurons. Furthermore, we will test the
hypothesis that inhibition of CHD2 and its regulated events (H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and genes involved in axon
guidance) compromises tumor growth using patient derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models. Together, the
proposed studies will provide both conceptual advances in the regulation of the unique gene expression
signatures in H3.1K27M DIPG and the regulation of the tumor-neuron interactions, an emerging field of cancer
neuroscience. Further, the proposed studies will also provide in vivo data to support future development of novel
targeted therapies for this incurable malignancy."
10886705,"Project Summary
 Neuropsychiatric disorders are a very serious medical and societal problem with many different origins,
however, a common and prevalent deficit found in these disorders is hypofrontality. Emerging theories posit
that hypofrontality [alterations in the ratio of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic transmission] underlie
schizophrenia, anxiety, addiction, autism spectrum disorders and depression.
 Methamphetamine (METH) addicts frequently develop hypofrontality and deficits in working memory
(WM), attention, and impulsivity. Similarly, in rodents, repeated psychostimulant administration or self-
administration elicits hypofrontality, WM deficits, psychosis-like behaviors, decreased interest in external
stimuli and surroundings, and decreased social functioning, suggesting that psychostimulant administration
in rodents represents a strong, face-valid model for studying the basic brain mechanisms that underlie
hypofrontality and cognitive disabilities in METH addiction.
 The overall objective of the proposed studies is to identify the effects of METH-SA on the activity of cortical
parvalbumin positive fast spiking interneurons (PV+FSIs) and the resulting changes in E-I ratio.
The central hypothesis- informed by strong preliminary data and literature- is that METH treatment elicits
cognitive deficits due to an increase in GABAergic synaptic transmission in the PFC via D1R activation of
PV+FSIs. The proposal’s rationale is that the experiments will yield fundamental knowledge pertaining to the
understanding of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying hypofrontality induced by METH and will
provide new insights into the basic mechanisms governing E-I balance in the prefrontal cortex. We will test the
central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the role of PV+FSIs in METH-
induced cognitive deficits. Aim 2 will determine whether D1R signaling in PFC PV+FSIs is required for METH-
induced enhancements of GABAergic transmission. Aim 3 will determine whether D1R signaling in PFC
PV+FSIs is required for METH SA-induced cognitive deficits and METH reinstatement.
 The proposed research is significant because it will fill a fundamental gap in knowledge pertaining to the
mechanisms underlying hypofrontality in METH-addiction and the effects of the psychostimulant in the activity
of cortical PV+FSIs. Furthermore, the knowledge obtained from the proposed experiments will help to develop
effective treatments to ameliorate drug-related cognitive deficits and can provide new insights into the basic
mechanisms underlying hypofrontality in other neuropsychiatric conditions."
10789940,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are pronounced sex differences in the incidence and etiology of mental health conditions. However, the
developmental mechanisms that give rise to sex differences in disease susceptibility or resilience remain
largely unknown. In this application we will explore the developmental origins of brain sex differences. In many
vertebrates, including mice, sex-specific neural circuitry develops under the control of estrogen signaling during
the first few days of life. Treating neonatal females with estrogen irreversibly masculinizes adult social
behavior, neural circuitry, and gene expression. To understand the actions of estrogen on the brain, we
recently identified the genomic targets of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and revealed that these genes are
differentially invoked in the developing and adult brain of both sexes. The goal of this proposal is to determine
the molecular and circuit consequences of early life ERα actions, with the long-term intent of connecting
individual ERα target genes to discrete sex-variable phenotypes. The posterior division of the bed nucleus of
the stria terminalis (BNSTp) is a key node in neural circuits that mediate social behaviors and is larger in males
compared to females. We hypothesize that BNSTp sexual dimorphism is specified by parallel epigenetic
events during a perinatal critical period: initiation of a persistent male-biased gene expression signature and
establishment of sex-specific neuronal connectivity. In Aim 1 we will determine the transcriptional mechanisms
that define sex differential gene regulation strategies: persistent early life gene expression in males, and
fluctuations in response to estrous hormones in adult females. In Aim 2 we will map the connectivity of the two
male-biased cell types we previously identified in the BNSTp, in both adults and across postnatal development.
In Aim 3 we will test the causality of perinatal ERα target genes and loci in specifying BNSTp sex differences.
Taken together, our findings will reveal how gonadal hormone signaling during early life permanently
influences adult gene expression, neuronal connectivity, and ultimately, sex-variable behaviors. This work will
provide insight into how a transient event during a critical developmental period can have significant impact on
the brain and behavior in adulthood. This critical period permanently affects brain structures and function,
suggesting that sex differences in psychiatric disorders, such as autism and depression, may originate during
sexual differentiation of the brain."
10908275,"1 Current approaches to designing and constructing synthetic gene circuits have reached a
 2 dilemma due to the substantial heterogeneity driven by circuit-host interactions, especially for
 3 large-scale gene circuits. The conventional trial-and-error iteration approach on synthetic gene
4 circuit development is regarded as inefficient since the assembled gene circuits often are
 5 susceptible to experimental conditions. One fundamental reason is that the heterogeneity driven
 6 by circuit-host interactions become significant with the increase of the number of components in
 7 gene circuits but are often neglected. Moreover, the lack of quantitative frameworks for quantifying,
 8 characterizing, and controlling heterogeneity in the host-aware synthetic gene circuits impedes
 9 the progress in the field. My laboratory has been focusing on dissecting the mechanisms of how
10 the circuit-host mutual interactions affect the gene circuit functions and developing control
11 strategies targeting circuit-host interactions to optimize engineered synthetic gene circuits.
12 Recently we found a topology-dependent interference of synthetic gene circuit function by growth
13 feedback, which was published in Nature Chemical Biology. We also found winner-takes-all
14 resource competition that redirected cascading cell fate transitions, which is in revision to Nature
15 Communication. In the proposed projects, we will establish experimental and computational
16 frameworks to quantify, characterize, and control the gene expression heterogeneity in the host-
17 aware synthetic gene circuits. The heterogeneity can result from stochastic cellular resource
18 allocation, stochastic biochemical reactions in gene circuits, and stochastic cell divisions. These
19 heterogeneities are intertwined due to the complex interactions between the gene circuits and the
20 host organisms, creating another layer of challenge and complexity to engineering robust gene
21 circuits. We will integrate a microfluidics system for time-lapse live-cell analysis, a Turbidostat
22 platform with Python-based easy-to-use web interface for accurate growth rate control and
23 automatic yet remotely-controllable in-situ fluorescence measurement, and hybrid agent-based
24 modeling algorithms for stochastic simulation of all the single cells in the bacterial community to
25 characterize the heterogeneity from various noise sources in the host-aware synthetic gene
26 circuits. I have built up my research group with all the necessary expertise and capabilities to
27 complete the proposed projects. This work will provide a systematic in-depth mechanical
28 understanding of the heterogeneity driven by circuit-host interactions, and will greatly help us to
29 rationally design and control the synthetic gene circuits for sophisticated clinical applications in a
30 real-world environment, such as bacterial infection and tumor microenvironments."
10890083,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 36 million people worldwide are estimated to be living with HIV infection and more than 1.2 million are
in the USA. With the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy, the life span of HIV-infected individuals
has increased significantly. However, the quality of life of can be compromised owing to a range of cognitive
deficits and memory loss, commonly referred to as HIV-associated neurological disorders (HAND). HIV-infected
individuals are more likely to suffer from substance use disorder (SUD), and disproportionately suffer from high
all-cause mortality. Drugs of abuse also increase severity of HAND by several potential biological mechanisms.
HIV associated cognitive deficiencies in conjunction with SUD decrease engagement in HIV care, which fuels a
worsening downward spiral of health status. Despite intensive research, there is no approved therapy for the
treatment of HAND and particularly for the combined neurological effects of HIV and drugs of abuse.
 We have developed and employed MOLIERE and AGATHA, AI-based literature mining systems that
discover novel interactions that potentially contribute to HAND. These systems also prioritize mining results to
uncover small molecules that can be tested for anti-HAND therapy. Experimental validation of MOLIERE was
achieved; four small molecules predicted by MOLIERE were shown to prevent HIV-Tat and cocaine induced
neurotoxicity. AGATHA improved MOLIERE results on a massive retroactive validation and is ready to be
deployed for wider searches that now include PubChem. In parallel, our previous efforts querying the Department
of Veterans Affairs / Veterans Informatics Network Computing Infrastructure (VINCI) with specific hypotheses
have successfully uncovered potential associations of unanticipated modifiers of HIV-associated pathologies.
 Collectively, these results led us to the central goal of this proposal to develop and apply an integrative
AI-based approach to analyze biomedical datasets and Electronic Health Records to determine new
mechanisms of HIV and substanses of abuse interactions, and to discover repurposed drug candidates
to be tested for the treatment of HIV-infected SUD patients. This will be accomplished in three Aims. Aim 1
will develop a multidimensional AI-based text mining approach to explore new mechanistic connections between
HAND and substanses of abuse. This will generate new knowledge of HAND and SUD interactions, and uncover
small molecule and drug candidates that can be tested for activity against the neurotoxic insults caused by HIV
and substanses of abuse. Aim 2 will develop and apply advanced machine learning and AI algorithms to explore
health records of HIV and SUD patients. The outcome will be the development of the machine learning system
to analyze VA data and generate of signals (hypotheses) for medications or medication targets that might have
value to experimentally test for repurposing to manage HAND. Aim 3 will prioritize the selected candidates for
experimental validation and further clinical development."
10894699,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
One in five adolescents in the United States will experience a depressive episode before age 18. Early prevention
could offset a lifetime of morbidity including work and social impairment, substance use, and suicidal behavior.
A critical step to preventing adolescent depression at a population level is the efficient detection of individuals
who could benefit most from targeted intervention. However, known risk factors (e.g., subthreshold symptoms,
cognitive styles, interpersonal factors) are often not widely assessed in practice until young people are presenting
for psychiatric care, and prospective risk screening tools built in traditional research studies remain poorly
implemented at scale in clinical settings where it may not be feasible for providers to routinely collect or integrate
additional measures. Large-scale, routine electronic health records (EHRs) from major health systems present
a powerful opportunity to overcome these prior limitations but have not yet been harnessed for adolescent
depression and often lack environmental and genetic data that may inform etiological understanding and risk
stratification. The overall aim of this K08 Career Development Award is to leverage large-scale EHR data with
linked genomic and social determinants to enhance the systematic identification of young people at elevated risk
of depression in real-world health settings. In this project, the candidate will develop and validate a novel
phenotype algorithm for identifying adolescent depression cases from a major healthcare system in the United
States containing up to 20 years of longitudinal EHR data for over six million individuals (Aim 1); integrate and
comprehensively assess a range of potential social and genomic determinants for EHR-based adolescent
depression (Aim 2); and apply modern statistical and machine learning methods to train and evaluate an initial
prospective risk stratification model for adolescent depression based on routine EHR data (Aim 3). Improving
the phenotyping and stratification of adolescent depression in EHRs will facilitate new avenues of research that
will be the basis of subsequent R-level grants that include external validation across health systems, refinement
of risk stratification and clinical trajectory models, and brief preventive interventions to enhance resilience in
those at risk. Supported by a solid foundation in psychiatric and genetic epidemiology and a multidisciplinary
team of world-class experts in an ideal environment, the candidate will acquire new expertise in predictive
analytics, biomedical informatics (specifically EHR-exposome-genome integration), adolescent depression and
prevention science through intensive mentored research and supervised training and professional development
activities. This Award will provide the necessary training for the candidate to develop into a fully independent
clinically informed investigator with a translational research program that bridges data science, statistical
genetics, and developmental epidemiology to inform actionable strategies for early depression prevention and
resilience promotion."
10889046,"This new RO1 proposal explores novel mechanisms of cardioprotection involving veno-arterial membrane
oxygenation (VA-ECMO) as a platform to reduce myocardial damage after acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
Use of VA-ECMO has grown exponentially in AMI over the past decade, however the impact of VA-ECMO on
myocardial injury has not been rigorously studied. New mechanistic insight into the effect of VA-ECMO on
reperfusion injury is needed. We recently reported the critical observation that VA-ECMO increases infarct size
in swine models of AMI and in new data have now identified a novel paradigm whereby VA-ECMO depletes
critical regulators of mitochondrial function and worsens heart damage in AMI. By employing highly translational
large animal models and clinically relevant interventional approaches, we will now explore new mechanisms
involving VA-ECMO and myocardial reperfusion injury, provide penetrating insight into cardioprotection, and
generate proof of concept data for the development of new therapeutic approaches to limit left ventricular (LV)
injury in AMI. The PI is an interventional cardiologist and advanced heart failure specialist who studies molecular
mechanisms of cardiac remodeling, reperfusion injury, and the hemodynamic effects of circulatory support
pumps. The current proposal integrates expertise in coronary and ventricular physiology, mechanical circulatory
support, molecular biology, and interventional cardiology to the field of myocardial reperfusion injury, for which
no specific therapy currently exists. We will test the novel hypothesis that VA-ECMO promotes myocardial
damage by worsening myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch through increased LV wall stress and
hyperoxemia-mediated injury resulting in loss of mitochondrial integrity and further that targeting these
mechanisms will reduce infarct size in AMI. Exciting new preliminary data show that LV decompression or
targeting normal arterial oxygen tension during VA-ECMO support can mitigate LV injury by reducing myocardial
oxygen demand and increasing coronary blood flow. We observed for the first time that VA-ECMO decreases
levels of tafazzin, a key enzyme controlling maturation of cardiolipin (CL), a master regulator of mitochondrial
integrity. In exciting new findings, treatment with elamipretide, a CL-stabilizing compound, before initiation of VA-
ECMO significantly reduced infarct size compared to reperfusion alone. These pioneering approaches address
major knowledge gaps by studying the effect of VA-ECMO on ventricular load, coronary blood flow and overcome
critical barriers associated with cardioprotection in AMI. To test our hypothesis we will employ translational
studies in swine models to determine the impact of VA-ECMO on myocardial blood flow (SA1), mitochondrial
integrity (SA2), and to test the therapeutic utility of a combined drug-device approach (SA3) to limit adverse
cardiac remodeling after AMI. This proposal has tremendous potential to impact our understanding of coronary
and ventricular physiology, circulatory support, and cardioprotection with important implications for AMI patients
and for ECMO use in cardiac or respiratory failure."

10819201,"Ending the HIV Epidemic Scientific Working Group (EHE SWG) Project
Summary/Abstract
The overall objectives of the SD CFAR Scientific Working Group (SWG) program are to: 1) identify priority areas
of HIV research through our strategic planning process, 2) develop research expertise and capacity in these
priority areas, and 3) coordinate new collaborations across the SD CFAR network and with implementing
partners (i.e., county public health departments, community partners, and local/regional clinics). We designed
our SWG program to be flexible, allowing us to respond to new research priorities as they arise. We anticipate
adopting 2-3 new SWG research topics during the 5-year award period.
In 2019, the U.S. enacted a bold plan to End the HIV Epidemic (EHE) by implementing interventions across four
key strategic pillars: 1) Diagnose; 2) Treat; 3) Prevent; and 4) Respond. In response to this historic opportunity
and after a robust strategic planning process in mid-2019, the EHE Scientific Working Group (SWG) was
launched in November 2019. Since its inception, the SWG has been highly productive in securing research
grant support focused on the EHE pillars. These accomplishments fueled continued enthusiasm during the SD
CFAR 2021 Strategic Planning Retreat to maintain the SWG’s focus on EHE as an opportunity to expand and
strengthen our activities in 2022-2023. The EHE SWG convenes established and early career investigators, as
well as implementing partners with diverse expertise and interest in developing better approaches to achieving
EHE targets. The EHE SWG capitalizes on: 1) location within a southwestern “geographic hotspot” that includes
six geographically contiguous high burden counties (5 in southern California, 1 in Nevada), and 1 nearby
jurisdiction in Arizona; 2) a long history of successful community-academic partnerships; 3) outstanding clinical,
epidemiology, and translational science research infrastructure; and 4) a successful partnership with the
internationally-renowned implementation science experts of the UCSD Altman Clinical Translational Research
Institute Dissemination and Implementation Science Center (DISC) - which led to the 2020-2023 funding of the
SD CFAR Implementation Science (IS) Hub.
With guidance from PAR-20-106 and input from SD CFAR members, we will address the following specific aims:
1. Expand Research: Expand partnerships with implementing partners and identify new priority areas of HIV
 research for future SWG research topics.
2. Engage and Network: Engage a broad range of scientific experts from the four EHE pillars to present and
 participate in regular EHE meetings and support SWG partnerships.
3. Educate and Train: Educate SD CFAR members on EHE goals and support the training of the next
 generation of scientific leaders in EHE research (and future SWG focus areas)."
10911209,"Far-field fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool in biological research due to its live cell compatibility and
molecular specificity. A major hurdle over the last ~100 years has been the limited resolution due to the diffraction
of light. Modern super-resolution microscopy methods such as single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)
overcame this fundamental barrier and improved the resolution of fluorescence microscopy ten-fold by
stochastically switching single dyes on and off such that their emission events are separated in time. This allows
their center positions to be localized with high precision in space, leading to a reconstructed super-resolved
image with a resolution down to ~25 nm.
 However, current developments and applications of SMLM focus on fixed cells in thin samples and cellular
structures that lie close to the coverslip surface. Indeed, the profound impact of SMLM on biomedical studies
has yet to fully unfold due to the following limitations: (1) live-cell SMLM is slow and difficult to achieve ultrahigh
resolution due to the small photon budget, the insufficient information carried per photon, and the required high
excitation power; (2) SMLM through large tissue depths remains difficult, due to the rapidly deteriorating
resolution and image fidelity in tissue specimens caused by aberration and fluorescence background; and, (3)
molecular resolution (1-5 nm) is yet achievable in whole cells and tissues at low photon flux conditions.
Overcoming these hurdles will help reveal the structure, function and dynamics for cellular constituents at the
molecular resolution in living specimens, and the reconstruction of nanoscale maps of multiple protein species
within a large tissue volume. These capacities will drastically expand the impact of SMLM applications.
 Our long-term goal is to develop novel optical imaging systems that achieve significant advances in defining
the structure and function of cellular constituents in live cells and tissues with molecular resolution. In the next
five years, we will focus on two research directions: (1) We will develop novel single molecule super-resolution
imaging technologies and a phase-encoded localization method to enable molecular-resolution 3D imaging in
live cells under low photon flux conditions. The innovations will enable us to capture 3D dynamics with 1-5 nm
resolution and construct time-evolved structural models of macromolecular assemblies in live cells. (2) We will
develop novel instruments and analytical methods to allow ultra-high resolution, multiplexed mapping of
fluorescently labeled targets in large tissue volumes.
 We will apply these developments to reveal the molecular organization and functions of networks of actin
filaments and myosins during the formation and constriction of the cytokinetic contractile ring in live fission yeast.
Also, we will determine the precise subcellular localization of molecular motors like dynein with respect to both
microtubule and actin in neuronal growth cones. We will also explore the correlation between nanoscale topology
of chromatin loci with defined epigenetic content and cell lineage and changes in gene expression profile."
10892039,"The goal of this training program is to seek continued support of the Interdisciplinary Graduate Education in
Movement and Rehabilitation Sciences (IGE-MRS) program, created at Northwestern University between the
departments of Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering and the department of Physical Therapy and Human
Movement Sciences. The mission of the IGE-MRS program is to expose engineering students to a graduate
education that combines engineering, neurobiology and physical therapy and human movement sciences
coursework along with the associated research experiences through a DPT (Doctor in Physical Therapy) - PhD
(Engineering) dual degree. The IGE-MRS program is the first program of its kind in the US to combine solid
training in fundamental neurobiology and clinical physical therapy with a solid education in engineering. This
interdisciplinary training allows for the development of the scientific basis required for understanding the
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying movement disorders and for designing effective rehabilitation
interventions and devices. The program mentors have successful science careers as engineers, neuroscientists
and clinicians, and represent a broad range of expertise relevant to movement and rehabilitation science and
physical therapy. Northwestern University has a long and recognized history in the study of motor control, motor
disability and recovery, and neural reorganization. Extensive research is performed in these areas at various
levels, from basic animal and human studies focused on the control of movement and movement disorders, to
the development of novel rehabilitation interventions and devices that address these movement disorders. Areas
of research represented in participating labs fall loosely into three main areas: neurobiology of movement
behavior and disorders, rehabilitation device and interface development, and musculoskeletal pathophysiology
and modeling. The breadth and depth of movement and rehabilitation research at Northwestern provides a robust
translational environment for our IGE-MRS trainees. In this renewal application, we seek to continue to build our
program based on past experience and increase our impact through enhancements designed to recruit and
enroll a more diverse trainee pool, expand representation of a greater number of laboratories and research areas
especially in Mechanical Engineering, and strengthen the career development opportunities that facilitate the
transition from clinical to research training and beyond into independent clinician scientists. Through these
innovations and the continuation of successful practices already in place, we fully expect to continue advancing
the science and practice of movement and rehabilitation science by training the next generation of DPT-PhDs in
Engineering. We intend to support a total of 6 DPT-PhD students per year and up to one affiliate trainee per year
during this competitive renewal. The T32 grant will provide support for a total of two years per trainee during their
PhD training. Northwestern will support the first year of PhD training, supplement tuition and stipend during the
two years of NIH support, and then fully support the entirety of the DPT training of this unique training program."
10886531,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Pediatric long-segment airway defects are caused by congenital malformations or result from trauma,
infection, or malignancy. Although rare, these defects are often fatal. There is currently no established surgical
technique to repair long-segment tracheal defects and the reconstructive options remain heroic. Tissue
engineering has the potential to replace failed tissue with a normal, living organ. Despite its potential, clinical
outcomes of tissue engineered tracheal grafts (TETG) have been poor.
 The main barriers to translation of tracheal replacement are graft collapse and delayed epithelialization.
We assessed the performance of decellularized TETG (dcTETG) in our mouse model of orthotopic tracheal
replacement. We identified that decellularized TETG can regenerate, restoring a functional surface airway
epithelium (SAE), however outcomes are limited due to graft collapse. Using resorbable biomaterials to stabilize
dcTETG, we created a Composite TETG (CTETG). We hypothesize the CTETG can improve overall survival in
long-segment tracheal replacement, attenuate graft collapse, promote extracellular matrix (ECM production) and
SAE differentiation.
 To test this hypothesis, we will first assess how CTETG promotes ECM regeneration in the tracheal
cartilage. In our first aim, we will implant dcTETG and CTETG in a mouse model of tracheal replacement and
quantify ECM production and mechanical properties. Using a conditional knock-out of chondrocyte-mediated
ECM production, we will then assess the impact on graft chondrocytes on ECM production. In our second aim,
we will define how SAE differentiation is promoted by CTETG. We hypothesize that modification of graft
dimensions with splinting reduces wall shear stress (WSS) resulting in improved epithelial differentiation. To test
the effect of WSS on SAE differentiation, we will implant dcTETG and CTETG of normal and small diameter,
thus increasing WSS by reducing graft radius. To quantify WSS, we will use computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
to topographically map WSS through the TETG and correlate these values with quantitative immunofluorescence
of neo-epithelium. Finally, we will validate CTETG performance in an ovine model of tracheal replacement in our
third aim. Using routine radiographic and endoscopic surveillance, we will quantify animal survival, clinical
manifestations, graft dimensions, and graft regeneration.
 This proposal advances the field of airway tissue engineering through the development of a composite
tissue engineered tracheal graft and defining the mechanical factors contributing to graft regeneration."
10868577,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects almost 15% of Americans, and renal injury often targets the renal tubule
epithelia. How these tubules respond can determine whether the kidney undergoes repair or tubulointerstitial
fibrosis (TIF), the common hallmark of progressive CKD. This proposal focuses on understanding how chronic
renal injury induces changes in the renal tubular cell cycle and metabolism and how these changes affect
tubular survival and the development of TIF. It is well known that cell cycle, metabolism, and mitochondrial
function are all closely coordinated processes, but it is not clear how epithelial G1 to S cell cycle progression
affects metabolism in the CKD kidney. Preliminary data suggests that reducing cell cycle progression from G1
to S phase in renal tubules protects against fibrosis in rodent CKD models and decreases tubular apoptosis. In
addition, reducing G1 to S progression increased glucose oxidation, the metabolism of glucose to pyruvate
which is then oxidized in the mitochondria through the citric acid cycle and electron transport chain. This
proposal will test the hypothesis that reducing epithelial G1 to S phase progression in CKD protects
against epithelial injury and fibrosis through altered metabolism. To test this, Aim 1 will use either a
pharmacologic (palbociclib) or a genetic (conditionally delete cyclin D1 in renal tubules) approach to reduce G1
to S cell cycle progression in mice. We hypothesize that decreasing G1 progression to S phase in epithelial
cells is protective in CKD models by reducing tubular injury and fibrosis. Our preliminary data show that
reducing cell cycle progression in both injured kidney tissue and in isolated tubule cells also suppresses
signaling pathways and inflammatory cytokines associated with kidney injury. This aim investigates how
reducing cell cycle progression may alter these signaling pathways to reduce tubule injury and myofibroblast
activation by autocrine and paracrine signaling, respectively. The second aim investigates the metabolic
changes that occur in injured tubules with reduced G1 to S phase progression using the Seahorse bioflux
analyzer, 14C-pyruvate oxidation studies ex vivo, and stable isotopic metabolomics. We hypothesize that
reducing epithelial cell cycle progression increases glucose oxidation leading to better epithelial survival and
less fibrosis, in part, through the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway. We will also investigate how glucose
oxidation in renal tubules, independent of metabolism, affects the response to chronic injury. The impact of cell
cycle progression on mitochondrial function and structure will also be defined using Oroboros and super-
resolution microscopy. These studies should provide novel information about how changes in epithelial cell
cycle and metabolism affect the response to chronic renal injury with the potential identification of novel
therapeutic targets to treat CKD."
10868567,"ABSTRACT
 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common forms of perioperative organ injury occurring
in up to 30% of post-surgical patients, and it significantly increases morbidity and mortality. A number of
vascular and transplant surgeries require interruption of blood flow to the kidney, rendering the kidney
ischemic and causing significant metabolic stress. The timing of this kidney insult is known; thus, the
possibility exists to intervene to protect the kidney. However, no treatment options exist to prevent or treat
post-surgical AKI. The development of kidney protective therapeutics has the potential to greatly improve
outcomes in the millions of people who undergo surgical operations and kidney transplants each year.
 Our long-term goal is to develop kidney protective therapeutics to limit post-operative and post-
transplant AKI. One such therapy could be to limit mitochondrial stress as the kidney is particularly
susceptible to mitochondrial stress due to its high metabolic demands. As such, the development of
mitochondrial protectants that could limit post-surgical and transplant AKI holds considerable promise.
Along these lines, our group has developed a novel peptide mimetic of the parent annexin A1 molecule
that in our preliminary data shows that it can ameliorate ischemic kidney injury in mice by limiting kidney
tubular cell death and upregulating sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) to augment mitochondrial function. Despite the
promise of our therapeutic to limit ischemic kidney injury, the novel mechanism by which it protects the
kidney is not known. Thus, the objectives of this proposal are to determine the mechanism through which
our annexin A1 mimetic augments mitochondrial function and metabolism and limits kidney tubular
necrosis to ameliorate AKI.
 In this proposal, we will determine the cellular signaling pathway through which our compound
upregulates SIRT3 and augments mitochondrial ATP production. We will also determine the mechanism
through which it limits mitochondrial-mediated necrosis in the kidney. We will treat transgenic mice with
our therapeutic and subject to both ischemia-reperfusion kidney injury and kidney cross transplantation.
We will measure kidney injury and perform a variety of measures of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial
function to assess efficacy and establish the mechanism of our therapeutic.
 Once completed, we will have defined the mechanism through which our novel therapeutic can
augment mitochondrial energy production and limit mitochondria-mediated necrosis to limit post-surgical
AKI. After study completion, we will be primed to pursue translational studies and further drug
development. The development of our new therapeutic would not only limit postoperative and transplant
AKI but also have broad implications for protection of other organs following surgery and transplantation.

10846702,"Abstract
Congenital hypopituitarism (CH) is a common birth defect frequently associated with syndromic
abnormalities in the central nervous system, ocular structures, face, and gonads. The most severe disorders
have midline developmental anomalies and include holoprosencephaly, which is usually embryonic lethal, or
septo-optic dysplasia. Less severe birth defects disrupt only hypothalamic or pituitary development, causing
hormone deficiencies that affect viability, growth, fertility, metabolism, and the stress response, and may
require life-long care. Over 60 genes are known to cause CH, many of which were first discovered in mice.
Nonetheless, 81% of CH patients still lack a molecular diagnosis, which would be invaluable for planning
treatment and predicting future risk. We propose detailed phenotyping of existing embryonic lethal knockout
mice with known genetic defects that result in hypothalamic and/or pituitary malformations. This will expand
the molecular diagnoses for CH and associated midline deficiencies in humans and increase our
understanding of organogenesis of these critical tissues. We identified a prioritized set of 18 embryonic
lethal or sub-viable mouse lines with obvious malformations in the hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland. This
set of genes are grouped based on function including epigenetic regulators, components of cilia, protein
modification, and other novel functional categories. We assembled a team of investigators with expertise in
hypothalamic-pituitary development, mouse phenotyping, and bioinformatics. We will conduct deep and
thorough phenotyping of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in the selected IMPC mice. Our pipeline has
three steps with appropriate re-prioritization at each stage. First, temporal and spatial expression of the
selected genes will be determined in wild type mice, the IMPC strains will be imported, and the
dysmorphology will be characterized histologically from mid- gestation to birth. Second, the strains will be
assessed for defects in vascularization and specification of hypothalamic neurons and pituitary hormone
producing cells using a combination of scRNA-seq and histological methods. Third, a mechanistic
understanding of the pathophysiology of the developmental defects will be determined using histology, cell
culture assays and/or established tissue-specific cre drivers to test hypotheses developed from scRNA-seq
and meta-analyses. This work will establish genotype/phenotype relationships for novel genes that are
candidates for the undiagnosed CH patients. Data dissemination will be timely and open, building on our
existing mouse pituitary analysis database (mousePAD) and blog, and the IMPC website. Future expansion
of our pipeline will add additional lethal or sub-viable IMPC strains with mutations in genes implicated in
hypothalamic-pituitary development, but not yet studied. We are poised to make a significant impact on the
discovery of genetic defects that affect hypothalamic-pituitary development in mouse and man."
10827515,"ABSTRACT
Over their disease course more than half of Crohn’s disease (CD) patients develop fibrosis-induced intestinal
obstruction and ultimately require surgery. No specific anti-fibrotic therapies are available. Despite advances
of anti-inflammatory therapies the incidence of strictures remains high, suggesting that inflammation-
independent mechanisms are crucial in the progression of the disease. The main effector cell mediating fibrosis
is the myofibroblast that is activated by multiple pro-fibrotic growth factors, such as transforming growth factor
(TGF)-1. Such activation results in accelerated secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) and remodeling of the
actomyosin cytoskeleton. Septins are understudied cytoskeletal proteins that regulate secretory and actomyosin-
dependent cellular functions. No data on the roles and regulation of the septin cytoskeleton in intestinal
fibrosis exists. Our preliminary data shows a high gene expression of septins 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 in human
intestinal tissues with septin 7 as the most predominant isoform, which is upregulated in CD. Pharmacologic or
genetic disruption of the septin cytoskeleton inhibited TGF-β1-dependent increase in ECM production (Collagen
I & fibronectin) and migration in immortalized and primary human myo/fibroblasts. Preliminary evidence suggests
this is post-transcriptionally regulated. Septin modulation improved experimental murine fibrosis. We hence
propose to investigate the hypothesis that remodeling of the septin cytoskeleton is a driver of intestinal
fibrosis and targeting the septin cytoskeleton is a novel approach to therapy of fibrostenosing Crohn’s
disease. This hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: AIM1. Characterization of alterations in septin
expression and distribution in tissue samples of IBD patients. This includes development of a high-resolution
map of septin expression profiles in human intestinal tissues and primary human intestinal myofibroblasts,
including generation of the first full thickness single cell RNA sequencing gut atlas for stricturing CD and controls.
AIM2. Investigation of the roles and mechanisms of septin dependent regulation of pro-fibrotic myofibroblast
activation. We will test if septin disruption or overexpression modulates TGF-β1-signaling, intracellular vesicular
trafficking or the translatome and post-transcriptionally regulated networks using a loss-of-function and gain-of-
function approach. AIM3. Functional exploration if targeting septins ameliorates intestinal fibrosis in vivo. We will
modulate septins in vivo using a pharmacologic and genetic approach and induce experimental fibrosis in two
different animal models. We will temporally control the deletion of the central septin 7 prior to (prevention) and
after induction (reversal) of experimental intestinal fibrosis specifically in Col I positive cells. If successful, this
proposal will challenge the paradigm of purely immune-driven ECM deposition driving stricture
formation and provide proof-of-concept for a novel mechanism to prevent or treat stricture associated
intestinal obstruction in CD patients."
10807025,"Abstract
Kidney cancer is increasing in prevalence and is one of the top 10 most common cancers world-wide. Clear cell
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common and aggressive type of kidney cancer. While primary ccRCC
is treated with surgery, 30% of patients are diagnosed with regionally advanced or metastatic disease that
requires systemic therapy. Despite current treatments that target the tumor microenvironment, the 5-year survival
rate for advanced ccRCC remains 11%. HIF-2 plays an important oncogenic role in ccRCC, which has led to the
recent development of the HIF-2 inhibitor belzutifan. However, innate and acquired resistance limits durable
responses in the majority of patients. Thus, there is a need to identify additional therapeutic targets that directly
inhibit the growth and survival of ccRCC cancer cells. The von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is
lost in ccRCC tumors associated with the VHL disease and in 90% of sporadic ccRCC tumors. Hallmark features
of VHL deficient ccRCC include constitutive activation of hypoxic (HIF) signaling, angiogenesis and metabolic
reprogramming. We recently discovered a synthetic lethal interaction between the RNA demethylase FTO and
VHL in ccRCC. Importantly, FTO knockdown reduces ccRCC growth and survival independent of HIF-2. Yet,
actionable mechanistic insights into 1) how FTO promotes VHL deficient ccRCC growth and survival and 2) the
therapeutic potential of FTO-based therapy in ccRCC are critical gaps in knowledge addressed in this
application. Our central hypothesis is that the m6A RNA demethylase, fat-mass and obesity-associated
protein (FTO), promotes glutamine reprogramming to support the growth of belzutifan sensitive and
resistant ccRCC. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim1) FTO promotes VHL deficient
ccRCC glutamine reprogramming by increasing the expression of the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 via m6A
demethylation; (Aim 2) FTO inhibitors create a metabolic vulnerability in VHL deficient ccRCC that can be
exploited therapeutically to treat belzutifan sensitive and resistant tumors. Upon conclusion, we will understand
the role of m6A RNA methylation and FTO as epitranscriptomic regulators of glutamine reprogramming in ccRCC.
This contribution is significant since it will establish that SLC1A5, an actionable and prognostic cancer therapy
target, is regulated by FTO through m6A modifications. Additionally, insight into the mechanisms of FTO-
mediated growth, survival and glutamine reprogramming is important for the rapid translation of precision
medicine approaches as FTO inhibitors are currently in clinical development."
10841664,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The dialogue between innate and adaptive branches of the immune system is a central paradigm of modern
immunology and is vital for protection against infections as well as for the pathogenesis of autoimmune, allergic
and inflammatory diseases. According to the current model, innate immune sentinels dispersed throughout
peripheral tissues sense, via their pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the presence of microbial clues or
endogenous moieties released during an infection, are activated and migrate to the draining lymph node (dLN).
This process enables a transfer of “information” from peripheral tissue to the dLN, where the antigen-dependent
adaptive immune response against the pathogen is initiated. The dLN also hosts an initial antigen-independent,
innate immune response governed by migrating phagocytes that enables expansion of the LN and establishes
a pro-inflammatory milieu. These events are required for the development and polarization of the adaptive
immune response. Here, we focused our attention on the capacity of ligands derived from the cell wall of Candida
(C.) albicans to dictate the LN innate response. Our working hypothesis is that the size and solubility of
stimuli that activate the PRRs affect not only the LN innate response itself, but also the final outcome of
the immune response. Also, that the LN innate response initiated by soluble fungal ligands can be
harnessed to develop a potent and protective adaptive immune response to prevent life-threatening
systemic fungal infections. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the physical form of fungal ligands dictates
the location where the initial immune response takes place, and thereby determines the activation of adaptive
immunity. In particular, we have found that small soluble fungal ligands that are immunosilent in the periphery
and do not cause an inflammation in the tissue, become potent immunogens once they reach the dLN. Also, that
the LN innate response initiated by these ligands completely bypasses the need of phagocyte migration from the
periphery into the dLN and, instead, requires a unique gene signature that is characterized by the production of
interferons and that is driven by the activation of the noncanonical NFkB transcription factor RelB in subcapsular
sinus macrophages. Notably, Dectins are required for this process but CARD9, the key signaling adaptor
downstream of Dectins, is largely dispensable. Plus, the initial innate response to the dLN instructs a potent
type 1 adaptive immunity and allows the production of antibodies directed against the most external layer of the
fungal cell wall. Fungal diseases are a global health problem and Candida species are the most common cause
of invasive fungal infections. We propose to unravel how physical properties of the PAMPs can be harnessed as
a therapeutic intervention against systemic fungal infections that are a major medical problem in the US. We
anticipate that identifying new features of the immune response that is anatomically restricted to the LN will help
with the design of an improved vaccine against poorly controlled pathogens."

 Most RNA molecules transcribed in mammalian cells do not encode for protein sequences. Among these
noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) is a vast family of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are larger than 200 nt.
LncRNAs can modulate cellular protein expression patterns by influencing the transcription of many genes, the
post-transcriptional fate of mRNAs and ncRNAs, and the turnover and localization of proteins. Telomerase
RNA is a unique class of lncRNA that functions as an integral component of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein
complex which maintains genomic stability and cellular immortality in cancer and stem cells. The overarching
goal of this project is to understand the mechanism and regulation of a novel mRNA-derived biogenesis of
telomerase RNA (lncRNA) in Ustilago maydis, a basidiomycete fungus.
 Telomerase RNA in Ascomycete yeasts and animals, telomerase RNAs are transcribed by RNA
polymerase II and share biogenesis pathways with small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and box H/ACA small
nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), respectively. In contrast, telomerase RNAs in ciliates and plants are transcribed by
RNA polymerase III. These distinct biogenesis mechanisms employed by these homologous telomerase RNA
molecules from different eukaryotic kingdoms or groups provide unparalleled opportunities for understanding
the fundamental principles underlying the biogenesis and evolution of the vast varieties of noncoding RNA
species in biology.
 We have recently identified the first Basidiomycete telomerase RNA from U. maydis, a fungal model
organism. Animal and yeast TRs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II with a protective cap at the 5’-end.
intriguingly, the U. maydis TR lacks a protective 5’ cap and is processed from the 3’-untranslated region of a
protein-coding mRNA precursor. In this research program, we will identify determinants in the TR precursor
that regulate the biogenesis of the mature U. maydis TR from the protein-coding mRNA. We will also study the
function and expression of the protein encoded in the mRNA precursor. Lastly, we will identify telomerase
accessory proteins in U. maydis and determine their roles in regulating the U. maydis TR biogenesis.
Successful outcomes of these specific aims will provide comprehensive and exciting details needed for
understanding the unprecedented mRNA-derived biogenesis mechanism of telomerase lncRNA."
10868649,"The goal of this project is to characterize how a network of transcription factors, chromatin remodeling factors
and gene interactions establishes and maintains the precise gene expression states that drive otic epithelial
cell development toward sensory or neuronal cells for hearing. The precursor cells for sensory hair cells (HCs)
and neurons are specified in the otocyst, which develops from the otic placode, an ectoderm thickening that
differentiates to form all inner ear structures. However, we know little about the regulatory circuits involved in
initial specification of pro-neurosensory progenitors and their subsequent neuronal versus sensory cell
commitment, thus presenting a major challenge for regenerating these cells to restore hearing loss. We have
shown that the Eya1 forms a key transcriptional complex with Six1 and Sox2 to induce HC fate by activating
Atoh1 in cochlear explant. Through mass spectrometry analyses, we identified components of the SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complex as Eya1’s interacting proteins. We demonstrated that forced expression of
Eya1-Six1 with Brg1-BAFs in cochlear explant induces nonsensory epithelial cells to differentiate into
Neurog1+Neurod1+Tuj1+ neurons. Our recent data uncover an essential role of Eya1-Six1 in regulating the
functional specificity of Brg1-BAFs to initiate pro-neurosensory fate in otic ectoderm by activating Sox2
expression through co-binding to multiple distal 3' Sox2 enhancers. The Brg1-BAFs are known to play a vital
role in promoting depletion of nucleosomes to allow binding of TFs to enhancers. As chromatin regulation is
critical for defining cellular identity, this application proposes to systematically characterize chromatin
regulation by Brg1-BAF complex and its interaction with TFs Eya1, Six1 and Sox2 in establishing the precise
gene expression states that define neurosensory cell identity by testing the central hypotheses: 1) depletion of
Brg1 in Eya1+ otic progenitors at different stages reduces the accessibility of enhancers with regulatory roles in
neurosensory cell lineage commitment and 2) many of these enhancer sites are co-regulated by Brg1-
BAFs/Eya1-Six1 or Sox2. This study provides a rich resource of genomic sites with regulatory potential and
also a ‘temporal’ clue for their activities critical to establishing neurosensory cell identity for hearing."
10833151,"Epistatic interactions within proteins can, in principle, make the paths and outcomes of evolution
contingent on chance events; they can also entrench proteins with residues that appear to be optimal but
are accidents of history. The extent to which epistasis actually affected the trajectory and outcomes of
molecular evolution depends on the fitness effects of substitutions when they occurred in history
compared to their potential effects earlier or later in time and on the temporal order in which interacting
substitutions occurred. Deep mutational scanning studies have revealed pervasive epistasis among the
huge number of possible mutations, but no studies have directly assessed how the fitness effects of
substitutions that happened during history changed over time as the protein evolved. We will perform
the first comprehensive experimental analysis of the fitness effects of all amino acid
states that evolved in a protein during a long-term phylogenetic trajectory, both at the
time they occurred and if they had occurred at other points in history. These data will be
analyzed in the ordered temporal context of the protein's phylogeny and supplemented with biochemical
experiments, enabling a deep characterization of the causes and consequences of epistasis,
contingency and entrenchment across the billion-year history of an essential protein.
 Our model system is ideal for this purpose. Hsp90, the essential molecular chaperone in all eukary-
otic cells, plays key roles in protein folding and maturation, cell signaling, and a wide range of diseases.
Strong phylogenetic signal allows confident reconstruction of the billion-year evolutionary history of
Hsp90's protein sequence from the last common ancestor of animals, fungi and related protists to
present-day Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We will generate targeted protein libraries containing every
ancestral and derived state that occurred during this phylogenetic trajectory, singly and in every possible
pair, in the background of all 30 reconstructed ancestral proteins along the trajectory. Using a high-
resolution bulk competition assay in yeast, we will precisely measure selection coefficients and epistatic
interactions and quantify how these properties changed over time. This will reveal the fitness effects and
interactions of every substitution at the approximate time it occurred, as well as the effects and
interactions it would have had if it happened (or reverted to the ancestral state) at any point earlier or
later during the trajectory. We will also apply biophysical and structural techniques to elucidate the
underlying biochemical mechanisms that drove these genetic and evolutionary phenomena. This work
will provide deep new insight into the ways in which proteins' genetic and physical architecture
influences, and is influenced by, the processes by which they evolve; it will also strengthen our

it has become clear that there is substantial variability in recruitment success across the national portfolio
caused by many factors: eligibility parameters, required procedures, compensation levels, engagement
practices, recruitment resources, skill and awareness of recruitment teams, geographic constraints, trust, and
perceived benefit/risk. Studies that do not integrate these factors into recruitment and retention often close
for poor accrual. In addition, there are now more equitable definitions of what constitutes “recruitment
success” beyond an absolute target, including: diversity, representativeness of the actual population, costs of
enrollment, retention, and time required. These complex dynamics suggest there is no ‘one size fits all’
solution, and careful attention and consideration must be a part of the recruitment plan. Our team has been
forming effective recruitment collaborations for the past 6 years -- considering the study specifics, capabilities
of the study team, and needs and values of the participant population -- to together craft feasible, effective
plans. In the next cycle, we will Catalyze and Harmonize Operational Innovation for Recruitment (CHOIR)
and will continue to be led by a long-standing synergistic partnership between Paul Harris, PhD, as PI
responsible for informatics development, and Consuelo Wilkins, MD, MSCI, as PI of community and
stakeholder engagement. Formal partnerships with 10 other CTSAs provide broad understanding of Hub
needs, along with key areas of expertise. We will extend and build upon existing recruitment-related assets
and data tools and resources already in use by our team and others (FasterTogether, ResearchMatch,
REDCap TrialsToday, FHIR clinical data-based recruitment infrastructure). These innovations acknowledge
recruitment is not a one-time activity but is a continuum. We will provide a national, disease agnostic home
for sharing recruitment tools, training, materials, and best practices for diverse populations. Specific Aims
are: 1) Partner with study teams to create study-specific recruitment plans, and support ongoing skills
development. 2) Evaluate clinical trial recruitment and retention methods and make continual improvements.
3) Enhance national clinical trial awareness through engagement and education; facilitate participant
identification of studies with online tools. And, 4) Develop and disseminate technical and procedural
approaches to catalyze enrollment in clinical trials across all CTSAs."

Disability continues to be common in adults with RA despite pharmacological advances two decades ago that
reduced disease activity. Physical therapy and exercise are effective in reducing disability in adults with RA,
however they are underutilized in rheumatologic care, particularly in the United States. Key contributors to this
underutilization includes lack of sufficient specificity for physical therapy and exercise recommendations in
treatment guidelines leaving rheumatologists unclear when to refer and lack of systematic processes for
integrating rehabilitation in routine RA care. To facilitate appropriate referral to physical therapy and exercise
for adults with RA, we created a model to PREserve Valued Activities In Life (PREVAIL) based on the premise
that early identification of functional decline will help direct physical therapy and exercise referrals to address
impairments before irreversible disability ensues. PREVAIL inserts disability screening into routine RA care
and uses the results of the screening to direct a physical therapy referral matched to disability level and RA-
specific exercise guidance. The objective of this research proposal is to develop and pilot test a scalable model
(PREVAIL) for integrating rehabilitation into routine care to preserve function and delay disability in adults with
RA. The aims will (1) define the distribution of disability levels and related functional needs in adults with RA,
(2) obtain key information from patients and providers on the acceptability and feasibility of the PREVAIL
model, and (3) conduct a pilot trial to determine feasibility and acceptability of the refined PREVAIL model in at
least 50 adults with RA. Successful completion of this proposal will establish feasibility and acceptability, and
set the stage for to integrate PREVAIL into rheumatologic care on a larger scale. My long-term goal is to
mitigate disability in adults with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. The objectives of this career
development award are to (1) deepen my current knowledge of rheumatic disease, specifically in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) care to better understand how to integrate rehabilitation, (2) train in health services research,
particularly intervention development and clinical trials, and (3) prepare to design and execute a larger clinical
trial in my next phase. My mentors are experts in health services research, rheumatologic care, and RA
disability measurement. Together, we developed this research proposal and career development plan to
accelerate my scientific development towards my long-term goal and research independence."

10873990,"Project Summary
Chronic infection and cancer are associated with suppressed T cell responses resulting in the inability to control
these diseases. Over the last 15 years, blockade of negative immune regulators has proven effective in a small
number of cancer patients and shown promise in animal models of chronic viral infection. Despite these
encouraging results, no effective immune therapies exist for chronic viral infection and most patients fail to
respond or develop resistance to checkpoint blockade. Recent work identified memory-like CXCR5+ TCF1+ CD8+
T cells which sustain T cell responses during persistent infection and cancer. Importantly, these cells generate
the major proliferative burst observed following anti-PD1 treatment. Further, the numbers of TCF1+ CD8 T cells
in tumors correlate with favorable responses to anti-PD-1 treatment. As such, approaches to expand these cells
are actively sought.
 We recently reported that blockade of interferon type 1 (IFN-I) receptor leads to expansion of CXCR5+
CD8+ T cells in an IL-27-dependent manner. IFNAR1 blockade promoted accelerated cell division and retention
of TCF1 in virus-specific exhausted CD8+ T cells. We found that CD8+ T cell-intrinsic IL-27 signaling promotes
the TCF1-high cells to maintain proliferation and avoid programmed cell death. Mechanistically, IL-27 endowed
rapidly dividing cells with IRF1, a transcription factor that was required for sustained division in a cell-intrinsic
manner. These findings revealed that IL-27 is essential for the expansion of TCF1+ CD8 T cells following
persistent viral infection. We hypothesize that IL-27 produced by specific cell subsets is necessary to
safeguard rapidly diving CD8 T cells from apoptotic cell death during both persistent viral infection and
cancer. We propose in this application to explore the basic biology of IL-27 signaling as it relates to CD8 T cell
expansion, survival and function. We will assess the cellular populations and signals that induce IL-27
production, assess how IL-27 prevents apoptosis of rapidly diving TCF1+ CD8 T cells and expand our exploration
into whether IL-27 signaling following anti-PD-1/L1 treatment during persistent LCMV infection and syngeneic
tumors is crucial for the CD8 T cell expansion/function. Once completed these studies will provide important
basic knowledge of how IL-27 regulates anti-viral and anti-tumor responses. Moreover, findings from this study
should point the way to treatments and modalities that can be employed to sustain optimal T cells responses."
10884280,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In 2020, suicide was among the top three causes of death for adolescents and young adults (age 10-34) and
among the top nine for adults (age 35-64). Recently, researchers have successfully developed suicide risk
prediction algorithms that have potential to vastly improve identification of individuals at high risk of suicide and
support primary care-based suicide prevention practices. However, there is very little evidence to guide routine
use of suicide risk prediction algorithms during healthcare encounters. The most well-known implementation
work to date has focused on outreach, like the ReachVet program, which researchers recently reported is
associated with greater treatment engagement and safety plan documentation and fewer psychiatric
hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and suicide attempts. Visit-based implementation efforts have
been less common. Kaiser Permanente Washington leaders piloted this approach using a using a visit-based
“flag” among providers in one mental health specialty clinic. The leader of this proposal partnered with
healthcare system leaders to conduct a mixed-method implementation evaluation, which found the visit-based
risk “flag” did not consistently prompt additional suicide risk assessment as intended by mental health
providers and provided a roadmap for quality improvement and future implementation efforts.
Therefore, the purpose of this project is to address the RFA-MH-22-120 objective by conducting a practice-
based pilot implementation evaluation designed to guide the use of suicide risk predictive analytics in primary
care. Specifically, a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, including developers of suicide risk predictive
analytics and primary care providers, will work in partnership to build and support implementation of clinical
decision support tools designed to identify and engage primary care patients (adults and adolescents) at high
risk of suicide in risk mitigation and follow-up care pathways. The research team will use the Discover, Design
and Build, and Test Human-Centered Design framework to support three specific aims:
1 (DISCOVER): Conduct qualitative and statistical analyses to identify opportunities to use predictive analytics
to guide clinical decision making to support suicide prevention in primary care.
2 (DESIGN & BUILD): Develop and iteratively refine clinical decision support using suicide risk predictive
analytics that will augment workflows for both identifying and engagement primary care patients (age 13+) at
high-risk of suicide.
3 (TEST): Pilot test implementation of clinical decision support prototypes in 1-3 primary care clinics and
evaluate the implementation via 1) provider surveys and 2) statistical analysis of clinical process and suicide
attempt outcomes.
This work will support use of suicide risk predictive analytics by healthcare systems nationwide and lay a
strong foundation for future evaluations of the effectiveness of this intervention for preventing suicide."
10888205,"Anxiety affects nearly one in three adolescents and contributes to substantial burden on both individuals and
society. Although evidence-based interventions for adolescent anxiety exist, treatment response is modest and
relapse rates are unacceptably high. Outcomes are even worse among low resource and racial/ethnic minority
populations. Recent studies have pinpointed neurodevelopmentally-informed targets that are relevant to
current evidence-based treatments for adolescent anxiety; namely, exposure-based cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT), which relies on principles of fear extinction. Our group and others have shown that fear
extinction and frontolimbic circuitry change dynamically across the first two decades of life, and is modulated
by the endocannabinoid (eCB) system. Further, our exciting preliminary data show that acute exercise is
associated with lower anxiety and elevated eCB signaling in youth, and is therefore a promising approach for
optimizing efficacious treatments for adolescent anxiety. However, these advances have not yet translated to
improved therapeutic outcomes for youth. The proposed project will leverage a multi-modal experimental
therapeutics approach to test whether acute exercise modifies hypothesized targets that are relevant for the
pathophysiology and treatment of anxiety in youth. One hundred and twenty adolescents will be recruited from
a diverse population at elevated risk of anxiety and randomized into either an acute moderate-intensity aerobic
exercise or sedentary control condition, performed immediately after a fear extinction paradigm (i.e., during the
memory consolidation phase). Our hypothesis is that acute exercise will boost eCB signaling, which will result
in increased fear extinction recall and enhanced frontolimbic activation and coupling. Concurrent
neuroimaging, psychophysiological recordings, self-reported fear and anxiety, and circulating biomarkers will
allow us to evaluate target engagement at several levels; specifically, we will test fear extinction, frontolimbic
circuitry, and eCB signaling as targets for exercise’s effects on fear extinction and anxiety risk. This project is
ideally suited for the NIMH BRAINS award because it will support the development of a productive early-stage
investigator in innovative, high-impact research. Results of the proposed project will demonstrate that a
relatively low cost and low risk (compared to pharmacotherapy, for example) behavioral intervention may be
used alone or in conjunction with current treatments to improve outcomes for youth. This significant and timely
study is an essential first step in a continuum of research that will ultimately lead to efficacious treatments for
adolescent anxiety, and novel preventive interventions for at-risk youth. This work will also further our
understanding of how fear is acquired and regulated in the adolescent brain. These outcomes are highly
aligned with the NIMH goals of delineating brain mechanisms (Goal 1), understanding risk factors and
biomarkers of illness and treatment response (Goal 2), improving prevention (Goal 3), and strengthening the
public health impact (Goal 4), given our group’s ties to mental health providers and school programs."
10896368,"Project Summary/Abstract
Arterial blood pressure (BP) and pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) are fundamental for diagnosis and
management of both systemic and pulmonary hypertension and for monitoring of surgical and critically ill
patients. Systemic hypertension is the most common modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the
leading contributor to mortality and disability in the world. Pulmonary hypertension is a group of pulmonary
vascular disorders leading to increased PAP, right ventricular failure, and death. It is also common in the
intensive care unit. Diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension remains challenging.
Arterial BP is most commonly monitored with the non-invasive cuff-based sphygmomanometer, which only
outputs brachial systolic and diastolic BP, differs from the critical central BP, and is prone to errors in the
presence of arrhythmias. Instead of providing a continuous measurement, its BP values are averaged over many
pulses. Invasive catheterization allows for direct arterial BP monitoring, but the technique is not risk-free.
Noninvasive estimates of PAP from echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), although useful, remain variable and operator-dependent. Therefore, right heart
catheterization is still the gold-standard diagnosis for PAP and pulmonary hypertension, despite being highly
invasive. Monitoring of PAP at home or primary care is currently unfeasible.
The overarching aim of this proposal is to evaluate whether a non-invasive radio-frequency (RF) sensor can
retrieve central BP and PAP transients accurately and non-invasively. We hypothesize that the near-field
coherent sensing (NCS) by RF carriers, which has been benchmarked on heartbeat and respiration
waveforms with the gold-standard devices, can also be applied to derive central BP from the vibration
characteristics of the aorta and pulmonary arteries in the entire cardiac cycle. The principle of operation
is similar to that of the ground penetrating radar and air-puff tonometry, where Hilbert-Huang Transforms and
machine learning can be adapted for BP signal processing.
Our effort will start from building a phantom heart model, which will allow direct pumping control and host the
NCS and catheter-based pressure sensors. We will also explore the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) NCS
to improve the local mapping of vibration characteristics. We will use anesthetized pigs as animal models for
aortic BP and PAP studies, where similar sensors from the phantom will be deployed. The accuracy of the
sensors and their ability to track changes in relation to the gold-standard pressure catheters will be benchmarked.
Aortic BP studies will be modified by infusion of inotropes and vasopressors, while PAP by acutely changing the
fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and by inducing surfactant depletion followed by lung recruitment. Additionally,
electrocardiogram (ECG) and photo-plethysmography (PPG) will be synchronized on the animals to investigate
whether noninvasive calibration of the NCS BP readout can be realized."
10885103,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our long term goal is to identify and understand the mechanisms underlying plasticity in visual
stimulus detection and visually-guided pursuit. Plasticity in these visuospatial orienting behaviors
are perturbed in both neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism as well as neurological
disorders resulting from traumatic experiences such as PTSD. Thus, development and plasticity
of these visual orienting behaviors critically impact healthy visual processing. In order to
ultimately develop targeted therapies that alleviate the specific visual processing deficits
associated with each disorder, it is necessary to first understand the mechanisms that underlie
the development and plasticity of visual stimulus detection and pursuit behaviors more
fundamentally. We will start to address this critical gap by investigating the development and
sensory experience-dependent plasticity of function of specific cell types of the superior colliculus
in the mouse as they relate to specific changes in visual stimulus detection and pursuit behavior.
The superior colliculus is a key subcortical visual system that processes salient environmental
stimuli, receives substantial input from cortex and mediates rapid spatial orienting behavior in all
mammals. The function of cells in this structure are sensitive to visual experience and change
significantly over development, and, two classes of cells in the superior colliculus known as the
wide- and narrow-field vertical neurons specifically underlie visual stimulus detection and pursuit.
However, we do not understand how these precise neural circuits are directly impacted by visual
experience throughout life. The mouse affords access to a broad range of sophisticatedgenetic
tools that may be used to close this gap in our understanding. In AIM 1, we will quantify stimulus
detection and pursuit behaviors at key developmental stages from postnatal day 21 to adulthood
to understand how these visual orienting behaviors change in the mouse. In AIM 2, we will
determine whether specific circuit changes support developmental changes in behavior by quantifying
the neural encoding of visual stimuli specifically in the wide- and narrow-field cell circuits of the
superior colliculus in the behaving animal. We will measure specific neural activity using high-
density in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, virus mediated circuit tracing, calcium imaging
and functional ultrasound imaging. In AIM 3, we will study the experience-dependent
development of both behavior and specific circuit function in the superior colliculus by
manipulating visual experience by allowing mice to hunt live insects (enrichment). Overall, this
work will advance our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying successful
spatial orienting behaviors that are essential for visual perception."

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Cancer stem cells
(CSCs) in the colon are the source of tumor initiation, proliferation, chemoresistance, and metastasis,
and are therefore considered to adversely impact patient outcome. However, there are no therapies targeting
CSCs for treatment of CRC. Pluripotency factors have been proposed to drive stemness in CSCs, but the
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Understanding the molecular regulators that enable stemness and
tumorigenicity in CSCs will identify novel therapeutic targets.
 The role of pluripotency factors is best understood in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), where their interplay
has been proposed to drive heterogeneity. We recently identified a potential transcriptional circuit between
pluripotency factors Klf4 and Zfp281 that we hypothesize enables ESCs to switch between specific stem cell
states and thus generate transcriptional heterogeneity. Notably, in CRC, Klf4 and Zfp281 have also implicated
as a tumor suppressor and pro-proliferative agent, respectively. Klf4 inhibits proliferation and expression of
Bmi1, an epigenetic marker that we previously identified as required for CRC tumorigenesis, whereas
Zfp281 is often co-expressed with Bmi1. Klf4 and Zfp281 display reciprocal expression in both ESCs and CRC
cells, but their correlation with stemness is reversed in the two contexts, such that Klf4 is associated with more
stem-like ESCs but more differentiated CRC cells. The role of pluripotency factor circuits has not been
addressed in CSCs, and the precise interplay between Klf4 and Zfp281 is unknown in either ESCs or CRCs. I
hypothesize that during both embryonic and cancer development, Klf4 and Zfp281 oppose each other,
forming a genetic circuit that modulates the balance between stemness and differentiation. I further
propose that perturbing this genetic circuit will restrict stemness and tumorigenicity.
 In this proposal, I will investigate how Klf4 and Zfp281 interact and regulate stemness in embryonic and
tumor development. Aim 1 will define the interactions of Klf4 and Zfp281 that generate opposing stem cell
states in cultured ESCs. Aims 2 and 3 will examine the role, and consequences of perturbation, of Klf4 and
Zfp281 in regulating stemness and tumorgenicity of CRC cells. Specifically, Aim 2 will use CRC lines and
organoids to determine whether Klf4 and Zfp281 knockout restricts the differentiation capacity and expression
of stemness programs in CSCs. Aim 3 will establish the interplay of Klf4 and Zfp281 with each other, and also
Bmi1, in CRC and determine how these contribute to tumorgenicity in vivo. This project will establish the
role of Klf4 and Zfp281 in stemness and tumorigenicity and the nature of the circuit between them. The
molecular and mechanistic insights of this project will further our understanding of how CSCs initiate and grow
tumors, as well as identify novel therapeutic targets for CRC treatment."
10811626,"Chronic pain (CP), defined as persistent (>6 months), non-malignant, musculoskeletal or generalized
pain, is a prevalent and costly public health problem. CP is highly prevalent among Veterans; 30-40% of
Veterans have moderate to severe CP. CP has a significant negative impact on mental health and quality of
life. CP is associated with declines in physical and social functioning, decreased activity levels, anxiety,
negative mood, and depression. Approximately 1.6 million Veterans Health Administration (VHA) enrolled
Veterans have CP and psychological distress associated with mental health comorbidities, including
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; ~50%), depression (~25%), and anxiety disorder(s) (~25%). Despite this
urgent clinical need and extraordinary economic and societal costs, there are currently no evidence-based
psychosocial interventions that simultaneously target comorbid mental health symptoms and CP interference in
Veterans.
 The proposed CDA-2 will include a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of
Cognitively-Based Compassion Training for Chronic Pain with Psychological Comorbidity (CBCT-CP+). The
trial will compare CBCT-CP+ to Health Education while Living with Pain (H.E.L.P.) control condition, in a
sample of 126 Veterans with CP conditions and psychological comorbidities at the VA San Diego Healthcare
System (VASDHS). The rationale for the proposed study of compassion meditation for CP with psychological
comorbidity is motivated by (1) a pressing clinical need, (2) a clear theoretical model, and (3) initial evidence of
its safety, feasibility and potential positive clinical effect for improving psychiatric conditions among Veterans.
This research is of direct relevance to multiple VA stakeholders (i.e., investigating the efficacy of
complementary and integrative health approaches for the treatment of complex physical and mental health
problems). Findings from the proposed RCT will inform clinical practice and policy by investigating whether a
compassion-based intervention targeting both CP and psychological comorbidities will improve treatment
outcomes for Veterans.
 The proposed CDA-2 will provide me with an important training opportunity to merge my primary
research interests and areas of expertise (psychosocial interventions for chronic pain and related mental health
conditions and complementary and integrative health approaches, including meditation). I will be mentored by
leading experts who specialize in CP treatment and assessment, RCT design and implementation,
complementary and integrative health approaches, particularly meditation, mechanisms of meditation-based
pain relief, and biostatistics. The proposed work will be conducted within a leading VA research center
(VASDHS) and world-renowned research institution (UCSD School of Medicine).
 The proposed trial will also allow me to obtain the necessary training for achievement of my long-term
goal to become an independent researcher within VA. Scaffolded training and mentorship in RCT
design and execution and biostatistics, advanced training in complementary and integrative health approaches,
and professional development will help propel me to independence as a VA intervention research scientist.
Finally, results of the trial will lay the groundwork for multi-site studies that would attempt to determine efficacy
of CBCT-CP+ across VA clinics and formally investigate putative mechanisms of treatment effects. This work
could ultimately lead to better care for Veterans, greater patient and therapist satisfaction, and lower costs to
VA."

This application establishes a new T32 training program in embedded mental health services research in
health systems leveraging the resources of the NIMH-funded Mental Health Research Network (MHRN).
MHRN is a consortium of 21 health systems across 16 US states serving more than 30 million patients per
year. Established in 2010, the network provides unique data infrastructure via a common data model,
including all electronic health records, insurance claims and administrative records organized using the same
variables and data definitions across sites enhancing efficient mental health services research. Importantly,
each of the MHRN health systems includes embedded research centers with experienced mental health
services researchers with long histories of NIMH funding. MHRN is a practice-based research network
leveraging close relationships between these embedded scientists and health system leaders, clinicians, and
patients to facilitate an iterative research-practice-policy ecosystem focused on studying key mental health
clinical and research questions. This strong relationship drives mental health care transformation. The
proposed program will include 2 MHRN health systems serving as postdoctoral training host sites, Henry Ford
Health System (Michigan) and Kaiser Permanente Northern California, and provide access, data, and
resources across all MHRN sites. This T32 will support 10 total postdoctoral fellows for 2-year training
programs during the 5-year award period. The program will use a novel training approach with virtual and in-
person training and mentorship embedded within the established infrastructure across the entire MHRN. The
program will integrate an external University-based faculty advisory committee and additional external senior
scholars. The program is interdisciplinary and expects to recruit doctoral-level trainees from many disciplines.
The core training and mentorship model will include the following aims for all postdoctoral trainees: 1) Didactic
training in health services research methods and mental health disorders etiology, prevention, and treatment
tailored for embedded health system research settings, 2) Individualized training and mentorship in grant
writing, dissemination, project management and leadership, professional development, and multi-site study
collaboration and coordination, and 3) Participation in all applicable MHRN health system activities. Our long-
term goal is producing independent scientists, who can engage in practice-based research through the pursuit
of early career funding opportunities for mental health services research."
10818590,"Project Summary (Abstract):
The proposed work seeks to identify the molecular basis for a novel interaction between two
proteins that are typically found in electrically active cells such as neurons and cardiac muscles
cells. One of the proteins is known as a voltage-dependent, potassium-selective KV7.1 channel.
This protein, hereafter KV7.1, is a major player for the termination of fast electrical signals. For
instance, KV7.1 is critical for terminating each cycle of the rhythmic electrical signaling in the
heart. In fact, a faulty, low-performing KV7.1 leads to arrhythmias that, in some cases, can
unchain fibrillations that result in death. In the auditory system, such alterations lead to hearing
disorders and deafness. The second protein is known as NaVβ1. This is an auxiliary subunit that
regulates the activity of sodium-selective, voltage-dependent (NaV) channels which are
responsible for initiating fast electrical signals. NaVβ1 is an important positive regulator of NaV
channels. In a few words, NaV starts an electrical signal event, and KV7.1 contributes to its
termination. What is novel here is that NaVβ1 not only boosts the activity of NaV channels, but
also decreases the activity of KV7.1 as we have recently found. Furthermore, we found that a
fourth protein, KCNE1 can protect KV7.1 from the inhibitory action of NaVβ1. Like with the pair
NaVβ1-NaV channel, KCNE1 can increase the activity and expression of KV7.1 channels. In cells
that express these four proteins, we will find NaV channels associated with NaVβ1 and KV7.1
channels associated with KCNE1. In the absence of KCNE1, our recent data suggest that, while
boosting that of NaV channels, NaVβ1 will decrease KV7.1 activity. In this case, the ON-OFF
balance of events generating fast electrical signals will be altered, leading to abnormal electrical
events. Our novel finding constitutes a shift in our understanding of how mutations in KCNE1
can affect cellular electrical signaling. If KCNE1 is mutated, KV7.1 activity could be lower due to
such mutation, but also could be further decreased by the action of NaVβ1. Some mutations in
KCNE1 have been shown to cause little alteration in the activity of the KCNE1/KV7.1 complex
when compared with the non-mutated pair. Yet such mutations are linked to diseases. This
apparent disconnect may emerge from not considering the action of NaVβ1, which could have
been gone undetected. This proposal aims at addressing this issue by expanding our
understanding of the effect of mutations in KCNE1 in term of its ability to shield KV7.1 from the
action of NaVβ1. The outcomes of this work will provide a novel paradigm in which KCNE1 is not
only a positive modulator of KV7.1 channels, but also a molecular shield protecting these
channels from the action of other regulatory subunits."
10951590,"Project Summary
Survivors of critical illness frequently experience profound physical, mental, and cognitive health impairments
that are initiated and/or exacerbated by known racial and socioeconomic health disparities and outdated
intensive care unit (ICU) mechanical ventilation and symptom management practices. This morbidity is
potentially preventable through the application of the ABCDEF bundle; a multicomponent, evidence-based
intervention to improve team-based care. While consistently proven safe and effective, national ABCDEF bundle
performance remains unacceptably low as clinicians continue to struggle with multiple barriers to bundle delivery.
The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop pragmatic and sustainable strategies to increase the
delivery of evidence-based practices that lead to improved care for critically ill adults across a variety of
healthcare systems, particularly those serving populations with known health disparities (safety net
hospitals). Our overall objective is to evaluate two strategies grounded in behavioral economic theory and
implementation science to increase ABCDEF bundle adoption. The strategies being evaluated target a
variety of ICU team members and known behavioral determinants of bundle performance. The proposed
project includes two phases and four aims. In Phase 1 (UG3), we will work with the NIH’s Healthcare System
Research Collaboratory Coordinating Center and our community partners to meet key milestones aimed at
enhancing and finalizing the implementation strategies and research methods used to facilitate and evaluate
the effectiveness of ABCDEF bundle adoption (UG3 Aim 1). In Phase 2 (UH3), we will conduct a pragmatic,
stepped-wedge, cluster randomized hybrid type III effectiveness-implementation trial. After creating 6
matched pairs of 12 ICUs from 3 hospitals (N=8,100 patients on mechanical ventilation), we will randomly
assign ICUs within each matched pair to receive either real-time audit and feedback (strategy A) or a
Registered Nurse (RN) implementation facilitator (strategy B) and each pair to one of six wedges. The aims
of the trial are to compare the effectiveness of real-time audit and feedback and RN implementation facilitator
on ABCDEF bundle adoption (UH3 Aim 1; primary outcome) and clinical outcomes (i.e., duration of
mechanical ventilation; ICU, hospital, and 30-day mortality; ICU and hospital length of stay; days with acute
brain dysfunction; discharge disposition, psychoactive medication, and physical therapy utilization; and 30-
day hospital readmission) (UH3 Aim 2). Finally, we will identify and describe key stakeholders’ experiences
with, and perspectives on, the acceptability and impact on workload of the implementation strategies (UH3
Aim 3). We expect study results will impact the field by developing simple, yet effective, ways of accelerating
the reliable uptake of a variety of evidence-based ICU interventions that will address known health disparities
in the ICU and ultimately improve the care and outcomes of millions of critically ill adults annually."
10866553,"Our broad research goal is to understand chromatin regulatory mechanisms in nuclear and epigenetic
programs and how these mechanisms are deregulated in aging and disease. A fundamental mechanism for
regulating chromatin involves the reversible modification of histones by chemical moieties such as acetyl-,
methyl-, and phospho-groups. These different histone marks are linked to discrete chromatin states and
regulate the accessibility of DNA to transacting factors. In budding yeast, histone deacetylation by the
chromatin silencing factor Sir2 prevents genomic instability and aging, and in mammals, de-regulation of
histone acetylation is linked to cellular senescence and aging-related pathologies from neurodegeneration to
cancer. Here, we focus on SIRT7, a chromatin regulatory, lysine deacetylase enzyme in the Sir2 family of
aging-regulatory factors. This project will study new roles of SIRT7-dependent histone deacetylation in
chromatin regulatory mechanisms that are deregulated in aging and age-associated cancer biology.
Inactivation of SIRT7 in mice leads to genomic instability, shortened lifespan and aging-related phenotypes,
and preliminary studies suggest that increased SIRT7 protects against aging pathologies in mice. However,
SIRT7 can also sustain oncogenic transcriptional programming in cancer cells. Thus, uncovering distinct
pathways of SIRT7 chromatin regulation, may be important to dissect pleiotropic functions of SIRT7 in aging
and cancer pathways. Recently, we identified a novel substrate of SIRT7, acetylated lysine K36 of histone H3
(H3K36ac), which is dramatically hyper-acetylated upon SIRT7-inactivation. H3K36ac is implicated in
chromatin remodeling and DNA damage responses in yeast, but its regulation and functions in mammalian
biology are largely obscure. In preliminary studies we found that the increased H3K36 acetylation in SIRT7-
deficient cells is coupled to decreased di-methylation at this residue (H3K36me2), a chromatin modification
that has important roles in gene activation, DNA methylation and oncogenic transformation. Moreover, SIRT7
interacts physically with the oncoprotein NSD2, the enzyme that generates the bulk of H3K36me2 in many cell
types. Here, we will investigate a new model that SIRT7 clears acetylation at H3K36 from large swaths of
chromatin to help prime NSD2-catalyzed methylation at H3K36. In Aim 1, we explore the connection of SIRT7
and NSD2 in aging-related processes using genomic, cellular and mouse systems, and in Aim 2, we test the
role of SIRT7-H3K36-NSD2 methylation axis in driving lung carcinoma in vivo, using pre-clinical mouse and
human cancer models. By uncovering distinct pathways of SIRT7 chromatin regulation, this project may suggst
strategies to selectively enhance functions of SIRT7 that are protective in aging without promoting oncogenic
SIRT7 activities. Together, these studies should provide insights into fundamental chromatin mechanisms in
aging and cancer biology."

The objective of the proposed research project is to further understand how progranulin (GRN) and β-
glucocerebrosidase (GCase) interact and the implications of these interactions in frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
caused by progranulin mutations. Frontotemporal dementia is a leading cause of early-onset dementia, and loss-
of-function progranulin mutations are one of three main genetic causes. Progranulin is a secreted and lysosome-
resident glycoprotein, and deficiency causes lysosomal dysfunction in patients and in mice. Progranulin-boosting
therapies have promise for treating FTD-GRN, but delivery is an issue and the safety profile is unclear. This
underscores a critical need to continue to search for targeted therapeutics with known safety profiles. Thus, a
targeted therapy that reduces progranulin deficiency-induced lysosomal dysfunction may have therapeutic
benefits for preventing or delaying FTD-GRN.
In order to understand the underlying lysosomal dysfunction caused by progranulin deficiency, our lab has
characterized the activities of several lysosomal enzymes in the brains of FTD-GRN patients and progranulin-
deficient mice. We found decreased activity of neuronal GCase, a lysosomal enzyme, whereas other lysosomal
enzymes show increased activity. GCase is an interesting target because of its known involvement in
neurodegenerative disease, as GCase mutations are the leading genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease and
the monogenic cause of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disease with neurodegenerative subtypes.
GCase deficiency in FTD-GRN appears to be due to an impairment in glycosylation causing GCase aggregation.
This proposal will determine if progranulin deficiency impairs GCase trafficking, resulting in decreased lysosomal
localization. The overarching hypothesis is that impaired progranulin-mediated GCase trafficking
contributes to lysosomal dysfunction and other deficits caused by progranulin deficiency. This proposal
will test the following two aims: (1) Determine how progranulin regulates trafficking of GCase and (2) Determine
if GCase deficits contribute to lysosomal dysfunction and other deficits caused by progranulin deficiency. More
work is needed to understand the specifics and effects of the progranulin-GCase interaction. I will first determine
the domain of progranulin responsible for GCase interaction and will then test the effects of this interaction on
GCase stability and lysosomal trafficking. I will then determine if increasing GCase is sufficient to reduce
lysosomal dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities in progranulin-deficient mice.
This proposal will facilitate my scientific and professional development by helping me: 1) improve competency
in rigorous experimental design and hypothesis testing, 2) refine known experimental techniques and develop
skills for translational research, and 3) gain experience presenting data to both scientific and lay audiences."
10878778,"Androgen receptor is a powerful sex-steroid hormone receptor that mediates homeostatic and pathological
functions in hormone-responsive systems in humans. Over the past 30 years, since the original cloning of the
androgen receptor cDNA, molecular insights into androgen receptor function, both normal and pathological,
have been gleaned from the discovery of proteins that bind and regulate androgen receptor activity. These
androgen receptor-interacting proteins, better known as the AR-interactome, constitute a functionally diverse
spectrum of proteins that modulate androgen receptor function in space and time at the cellular level. Like
other sex-steroid hormone receptor family members, androgen receptor is a very sticky receptor. It has more
than 350 binding partners, which allows androgen receptor to serve as a hub to regulate cellular signaling at
the molecular level through dynamic protein interactions with the AR-interactome. Unfortunately, the AR-
interactome continues to grow over time with no clear end in sight. Our inability to define the AR-interactome in
a single cellular model has made it nearly impossible to experimentally replicate the AR-interactome and
understand how their coordinated actions regulate AR-dependent signaling in space and time. Thus,
quantitative and predictive models of AR-dependent signaling remain speculative at best. Our scientific
premise is that the careful annotation and discovery of the AR-interactome in cells will lay the foundation for
understanding how this subproteome contributes to physiologic and pathologic androgen receptor functions in
hormone-responsive systems. Thus, we have proposed an experimental plan to annotate the AR-interactome
in androgen-sensitive cellular models using cutting-edge, quantitative proteomic techniques. Our proteomic
approaches will define a spatiotemporal map of the AR-interactome in cells, and lay the foundation for probing
genetic relationships within and between protein complexes comprising the AR-interactome. The proteomic
findings will allow us to develop testable models of AR-dependent signaling in cellular systems. These models
will provide a molecular framework to understand how androgen-mediated signaling operates under
homeostatic and pathological states. More importantly, they will guide the discovery of novel druggable targets
among the AR-interactome so that corrupted AR-dependent signaling can be attenuated in androgen receptor-
related pathologies that afflict reproductive and non-reproductive systems in humans."
10811620,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained adult arrhythmia, associated with an increased risk of stroke,
heart failure and dementia. With increased longevity in chronic diseases, the prevalence of AF – currently
estimated at 46 million worldwide – is dramatically rising. Catheter ablation – tissue destruction – is the most
effective therapy but is fraught with procedural risks and suboptimal efficacy. The cardiac autonomic system
(CANS) is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of AF, but no specific diagnostic or therapeutic approaches
have evolved from this. Our long-term goal is to devise neuromodulatory AF treatment and preventive strategies
and fill the knowledge gap on the mechanisms by which CANS neuronal and humoral paracrine output modulate
atrial function in humans. We break through existing technical barriers that limited our understanding of intrinsic
cardiac ganglia, capitalizing on the vein of Marshall as a vascular route to sample its electrophysiology and
humoral responses, collecting atrial coronary circulation blood, and recording nerve activity from the
ganglionated plexi (GP). Our extensive preliminary data in patients shows that apnea increases GP activity
measured using novel percutaneous technology in AF patients undergoing ablation procedures. Remarkably,
we found that Substance P (SP) collected from the coronary sinus is elevated compared to undetectable levels
in peripheral blood of AF patients suggesting that GP activation via secreted SP may play a role in AF substrates.
In large animal models, we have found that specific ablation of GP sensory neurons blunts the pro-fibrillatory
response to apnea and that a crescendo GP response occurs after repeated consecutive apneas. Our data in
human pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-aCM) shows that chronic SP treatment affects
cardiomyocyte electrophysiology and modifies gene expression of miR-21 targets. These exciting observations,
innovative methods, and unique clinical and basic science expertise position our team to develop this project
successfully. We propose the central hypothesis that CANS produces a substrate for AF through neural
(nerve firing) and humoral effects (secretome), in which SP – released by GP sensory neurons – plays a
major role in increasing susceptibility to AF through direct electrophysiological and genomic effects in
atrial cardiomyocytes. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing studies 1) in humans with paroxysmal
and persistent AF aiming to measure nerve activity and secretome of intrinsic ganglia through the vein of Marshall
during ablation procedures, 2) in canine models of acute and persistent AF to determine whether ablation of GP
or SP antagonism ameliorates AF, 3) in hiPSC-aCM and engineered atrial tissues to elucidate SP actions. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide a mechanistic understanding of the relationship
between CANS and sleep apnea for the continued development of effective therapies against AF. Ultimately,
such knowledge can offer new opportunities to develop innovative therapies to treat AF."
10847361,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A number of transcriptional regulators have been found to regulate the hallmarks of aging. In previous work,
we found that the FOXO family of transcriptional regulators, which have been implicated in healthy aging
across species, directly regulate a conserved network of target genes. In mice, FOXOs are central regulators
of stem cell homeostasis during aging and are critical for tissue integrity. In humans, SNPs in the FOXO3 locus
have been linked to longevity, and the upstream regulator of FOXO’s, insulin/IGF signaling must be tightly
regulated to preserve healthy aging. Yet, we still lack an understanding of how FOXOs function at the
chromatin level, and how their activity is altered during aging and in the context of neurodegeneration. In
preliminary work, we identified for the first time the direct network of FOXO3 targets in human cells, and found
that FOXOs function as pioneer factors to deploy a secondary network of transcriptional regulators to extend
their target gene network. Here, we will address this critical question of the mechanisms underlying the pioneer
activity, its heterogeneous nature, and how it changes in the context of aging and Alzheimer’s Disease.
Completion of this work will reveal the chromatin-level changes that influence the activity of factors that counter
aging and neurodegeneration, which may lead to strategies to improve associated pathologies."

During homeostasis and proper acute immune responses, interleukin-18 (IL-18) acts as a facilitator of higher
cerebral functions and as an alarmin molecule to signal incoming danger to cells. Our studies led us to discover
endogenous counter-regulatory components in the IL-18 pathway that are impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD),
which results in excessive and prolonged signaling. More importantly, we found compelling evidence that this
process plays a major role in the dysregulation of tau and accumulation of its pathological species. Investigating
the underlying mechanisms by which the IL-18 pathway is affected by and drives tau pathology in AD could,
therefore, yield novel means to mitigate this insidious disease. Here we propose three aims to investigate this
important issue. In aim 1, we hypothesize that β-amyloid (Aβ) disrupts the endocytic protein Tollip (toll interacting
protein), which is the leading regulator driving the homologous desensitization of the IL-18 receptor (IL-18R). We
will genetically up- or downregulate Tollip in neuronal cell cultures and in an AD mouse model. The outcome of
this aim may show that the buildup of pathological forms of tau induced by chronic IL-18 signaling in neurons is,
at least in part, caused by the upregulation of IL-18R due to the impairment of its trafficking and degradation
mediated by Tollip. For the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that the deficiency in the production of IL-
18's endogenous decoy receptor, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), also plays a role in the chronic activation of
this pathway in AD. We will use an adeno associated virus to upregulate IL-18BP levels in AD mice and
determine its therapeutic efficacy on AD-like pathology. Finally, our last aim utilizes biochemical and proteomic
methods to map the neuronal intracellular networks affected in response to IL-18. We will apply pharmacological
and genetic tools to link potential candidates altered by IL-18, such as protein kinases and phosphatases, to the
hyperphosphorylation of tau and subsequent synaptic loss and cognitive decline. Establishing these intracellular
cascades could allow us to identify novel strategies to inhibit the pathological effects of IL-18, while preserving
its relevant physiological functions. Overall, our studies are significant for two reasons: first, they will provide
greater insights into the IL-18 signaling cascade and second, they will uncover the critical steps specifically
involved in the IL-18 pathway in AD, and may result in the identification of new therapeutic candidates to
potentially translate our discoveries into the clinic."

G-qudruplex (G4) is a noncanonical secondary structure that can form in both DNA and RNA. Human genome
contains over 400,000 potential G4 forming sequences (PQS) and they are highly enriched in upstream of
oncogene promoters and regulatory genes, strongly suggesting a switch-like function with programed positioning.
PQS is also prevalent in e. coli genome, located in important regulatory regions. Indeed, many studies have
demonstrated the role of G4 in up or downregulating genomic processes including replication, transcription and
translation. Our recent study demonstrated that in transcription, G4 forming sequence located in the non-
template strand leads to a robust formation of R-loop (mRNA annealed to template strand), which in turn, induces
G4 structure in the non-template strand. Remarkably, such R-loop/G4 structure drives enhanced transcription
by a mechanism that involves successive formation and release of R-loop. We show that when positioned in a
plasmid i.e under torsional constraint, such G4/R-loop structure can tune the transcription activity up or down
depending on the distance from the transcription start site. Furthermore, 5’UTR-G4 bearing mRNA (RG4) leads
to over 10-fold enhanced translation in a cell-free system and in e.coli cells. Upon testing several plausible
hypotheses, we propose that the RG4 structure promotes translation by blocking ribosomes from sliding off the
mRNA. Building on these exciting new findings, we propose to investigate the impact of G4, R-loop and
supercoiling in transcription and translation primarily in T7 RNAP system and in e. coli cells. By combining
quantitative biochemical tools and newly developed single molecule platforms suited to measure stepwise
progression of transcription in a linear or plasmid DNA, we will examine how different sequence, length and
position of G4 forming sequence leads to R-loop formation, mRNA output and protein production. Accomplishing
the proposed goals will reveal the structure-function relationship of how G4, R-loop and supercoiling regulates
transcription and translation activity."

Rigorous data from our lab and others indicate that the gut microbiome may an underappreciated contributor to
inter-individual variations in cancer drug efficacy and side effect profiles; however, we currently lack the
mechanistic insights and data from preclinical mouse models necessary to inform ongoing studies in cancer
patients. We selected fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrug capecitabine (CAP), as
an initial test case due to their critical role in colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy, increasing oral administration,
highly variable pharmacokinetics, and unexplained differences in efficacy and toxicity. We propose a series of
in vitro and mouse studies to dissect the human gut bacterial species, genes, and enzymes responsible for the
metabolism of 5-FU (Aim 1) and CAP (Aim 2), including their downstream consequences for drug
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD).
Our overarching hypothesis is that the oral bioavailability and therapeutic effects of fluoropyrimidines
are influenced by pathways for drug metabolism encoded by diverse human gut bacterial species.
In Aim 1, we will identify and characterize the primary gut bacterial taxon responsible for 5-FU inactivation
through a combination of biochemical and cell-based assays coupled to studies in gnotobiotic and xenograft
mouse models. Based on our Preliminary Results, we hypothesize that Anaerostipes is the primary gut
bacterial genus responsible for inter-individual variations in the metabolism of 5-FU.
In Aim 2, we seek to discover the bacterial enzymes responsible for the activation of CAP to 5-FU, motivated
by the surprising finding that E. coli can activate CAP leading to reduced bacterial growth at high
concentrations. We hypothesize that E. coli catalyzes a 3-step metabolic pathway that mirrors the mammalian
conversion of CAP to 5-FU.
Our results in Aim 1 will provide a valuable proof-of-principle for dissecting the conservation and redundancies
in clinically relevant microbial biotransformations, helping to move beyond studies of model gut bacteria to
identify the most translationally relevant species. Aim 2 is potentially paradigm-shifting in that it would provide
definitive evidence for CAP bioactivation outside of hepatocytes and cancer cells, creating new opportunities to
improve treatment outcomes and study the physiological role and broader impacts of this metabolic pathway.
Taken together, this research plan emphasizes the conservation of the pathways for metabolism of
therapeutics across domains of life, highlighting the need to distinguish the relative contributions of human and
microbial cells to drug disposition, efficacy, and side effect profiles. Due to our focus on drugs used as current
standard of care and naturally occurring bacterial species prevalent in the human gut microbiome, this
preclinical research program has clear translational relevance and is highly synergistic with ongoing clinical
studies of cancer patients conducted by our team and the broader microbiome field."

 Speech sound disorders impacting /ɹ, s, z/ may become chronic due to either ineffective or limited treat-
ment. The long-term goal is to leverage theoretical and technological advancements to accelerate the develop-
ment of accessible and effective treatments that mitigate reduced quality of life due to chronic residual speech
sound disorders (RSSD). To this end, the validated motor-based RSSD treatment Speech Motor Chaining guides
speech-language pathologists (SLPs) through high-fidelity, high-trial, rapidly adapting treatment by dosing and
manipulating several principles of motor learning in real time. SLP-led Speech Motor Chaining has been effective
for individuals whose errors persist after traditional treatment. However, at least two challenges remain: first,
optimal treatment intensity is unknown. Second, SLPs need validated avenues for evidence-based practice when
caseload size precludes optimal intensity. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to optimize a suite
of theoretically motivated, high-fidelity, motor-based treatments delivered at the appropriate intensity, despite
practical barriers, for the sounds comprising 90% of RSSD: /ɹ, s, z/. The central working hypotheses, supported
by our preliminary work, are that Speech Motor Chaining is (a) more efficacious when delivered intensively (i.e.,
closely spaced for a fixed number of sessions), and (b) also beneficial when practice is led by an artificial intelli-
gence (AI) SLP. The theoretical rationale is that increasing intensity early in treatment will mitigate erred prac-
tice between sessions, improving outcomes relative to more customary practice distributions, and that reliable
AI-mediated practice is effective in the context of validated treatments. There are three aims: Aim 1: Deter-
mine how intensive/distributed treatment affects speech sound learning in RSSD. A randomized
controlled trial (n=84) will test the hypothesis that intensive SLP-led Speech Motor Chaining (i.e., bootcamp)
leads to greater gains in speech sound accuracy compared to an equivalent number of customarily distributed
sessions. Aim 2: Determine improvement in /ɹ/ production when Speech Motor Chaining practice
trials are led by an Artificial Intelligence clinician. A multiple baseline single subject design will test the
hypothesis that Chaining-AI, in which an AI SLP provides clinical feedback, facilitates clinically meaningful
change in /ɹ/ production. Aim 3: Demonstrate breadth of clinical AI capability by optimizing mis-
pronunciation classification algorithms for /s/ and /z/. Mispronunciation detection algorithms will be
trained to recognize clinical speech errors affecting /s/ and /z/, replicating expert listener judgement with clini-
cally-acceptable accuracy. This significant research addresses a critical need for theoretical/empirical guidance
for treatment intensity, offering sorely needed recommendations in a system where ~6 million American adults
have unresolved RSSD. This innovative research accelerates a paradigm shift in which combined SLP/AI service
delivery could overcome barriers to effective, accessible, and sufficiently intensive treatment, for 90% of RSSD."
10792638,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The neocortex is an exclusive structure of the mammalian central nervous system. In humans, the neocortex is
involved in higher-order brain functions such as cognition and language. All projection neurons in the neocortex
are born from a common pool of neural progenitors at the surface of the lateral ventricles of the telencephalon.
Post-mitotic projection neurons must migrate from the proliferative niche to their intended cortical layers in order
to mature and establish functional synaptic contacts. Misregulation of PN migration has devastating
consequences for human health and results in a series of neuronal migration disorders that disrupt neural
circuitry and/or brain morphology, leading to cognition problems, neuropsychiatric disease, epilepsy, and
neuroanatomical malformations. The overarching goal of this project is to define novel molecular mechanisms
that instruct projection neuron migration, migration ending, and settling in their final position in the neocortex.
Recently, we have identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL5 as a key regulator of migration and final positioning of
projection neurons in the cortex. Here, we aim to understand the CRL5-dependent molecular mechanisms that
control pyramidal neuron migration and termination. Our preliminary data indicate that CRL5 regulates the levels
of two crucial phosphoinositide signaling lipids, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) in projection neurons. Our data also suggests that CRL5
regulates PIP2 and PIP3 levels by opposing the activity of the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K)
and phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), which synthesizes PIP2 and PIP3, respectively. Moreover, CRL5 also
controls Ca2+ dynamics by regulating the frequency of Ca2+ events, which are crucial for pyramidal neuron
migration. This proposal aims to address the role of CRL5 during projection neuron migration and cortical
development by answering the following questions:
1) How does CRL5 regulate PIP5K and PI3K activity to control phosphoinositide levels?, 2) Is CRL5 regulating
PIP2 and PIP3 levels to control projection neuron migration?, 3) Does CRL5 participate in Ca2+ dynamics in
projection neurons by controlling Ca2+ channels activity/localization?, and 4) Does CRL5-dependent regulation
of PIP2 and PIP3 levels directly affect Ca2+ dynamics? The successful completion of the project will provide the
first detailed molecular framework of how CRL5 controls projection neuron migration and termination to
orchestrate cortical morphogenesis and identify CRL5 as a novel regulator of phosphoinositides metabolism and
Ca2+ dynamics in the nervous system. Completion of this project will offering potential targets for therapeutic
intervention in neuronal migration disorders."

Older patients with gynecologic cancers have increased advanced stage at presentation, more aggressive
histology and more commonly require adjuvant chemotherapy. This chemotherapy, as well as underlying cancer,
cause accelerated aging and toxicity, leaving women vulnerable to functional decline, increased frailty,
decreased health related quality of life. Physical activity has been shown to improve functional health, improve
quality of life, slow aging, and decrease rates of frailty and sarcopenia. However, limitations exist in allowing
older gynecologic cancer patients to access existing physical activity interventions, namely that many are
delivered in person and do not account for the varied time course of symptoms related to chemotherapy. The
use of remotely delivered mobile health (mHealth) technology-based physical activity interventions has been
shown to increase physical activity in diverse populations including patients with metastatic cancer and older
adults.
The objective of this study is to use a multi-phase optimization strategy (MOST) clinical trial design to determine
which components of an mHealth physical activity intervention (Fit4Treatment) delivered over 12 weeks with a
12 week follow-up meaningfully contribute to increasing physical activity of any intensity among older women
with gynecologic cancer receiving chemotherapy. Participants will be randomly assigned to a combination of
zero to four different intervention components using a full factorial design to estimate the effects of each
component on increasing steps. The Fit4Treatment components include 1) symptom burden tailored goal setting
2) social support through an exercise care partner 3) treating oncology provider engagement and 4) coaching.
We will also test how changes in physical activity improve patient-reported outcomes (physical function, fatigue,
anxiety, quality of life), aging outcomes (frailty, functional performance) and cancer outcomes (chemotherapy
delays, progression free survival). Finally, we will examine both mediators (adherence, self-efficacy) and
moderators (age, treatment dose, cancer type) of the effects of the components of the Fit4Treatment on
increasing physical activity.
This research expands upon the robust work of our group examining the use of well-tested, patient-led, physical
activity interventions to improve cancer patients’ health and survival, and is innovative in the use of an efficient
MOST study design, examining a new high-risk population, and testing the effects of physical activity on aging
and functional outcomes. This study will lead to an improved understanding of how to effectively increase
physical activity among older patients with gynecologic cancers, a high-need and understudied population.
Ultimately, these results will improve the health, quality of life and survival of older cancer survivors."

Scientific Abstract of proposed research project
Immune checkpoint blocker therapy has revolutionized our clinical approach in cancer therapy. However, the
overall response rate still has room for improvement and varies greatly in different cancer types. The
redundant but unique role of immune checkpoints in T cell immunity propels us to further study the role of
novel immune checkpoints in cancer therapy. The BigLEN/GPR171 interaction is a newly identified GPCR
pathway that has been reported to regulate food uptake and anxiety. Though GPR171 is commonly used as a
T cell signature gene, its potential role in T cell immunity has not been explored. Our recent studies have
implicated that the GPR171/BigLEN axis is a new T cell checkpoint pathway that can be modulated for cancer
immunotherapy. We found that GPR171 is transcribed in T cells and its protein expression is induced upon
antigen stimulation. The neuropeptide ligand BigLEN interacts with GPR171 to suppress T cell receptor-
mediated signaling pathways and to inhibit T cell proliferation. Loss of GPR171 in T cells leads to hyperactivity
to antigen stimulation and GPR171-deficient mice exhibit enhanced antitumor immunity. Blockade of GPR171
signaling by an antagonist promotes antitumor T cell immunity in various mouse tumor models. Our preliminary
data further implicate that GPR171 can be an inhibitory receptor on T cell for cannabinoids. In the proposed
study, we will dissect the role of GPR171 ligands in GPR171-mediated antitumor suppression. We will further
determine the molecular mechanisms that GPR171 signaling inhibits anticancer T cell response. The approach
of GPR171 blockade for cancer therapy will be tested in clinical tumor models, including chimeric antigen
receptor T-cell therapy and humanized mouse model together with anti- PD-1 therapy. By the completion of
these studies, our discovery that GPR171 is a receptor for cannabinoids will help to better understand the
impact of cannabis usage in cancer treatment, more importantly, provide new strategies of cancer
immunotherapy."
10849737,"This application focuses on Fbw7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and tumor suppressor, and on its substrate c-Myc
(hereafter, Myc), an oncogenic transcription factor widely implicated in human cancers. E3 ligases mark
protein substrates for degradation through ubiquitin conjugation. Fbw7 recognizes a network of proteins with
crucial roles in proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, and apoptosis. Fbw7 substrates include important
oncoproteins (e.g., cyclin E, Notch, Myc, Jun) and thus Fbw7 mutations promote tumorigenesis by
deregulating its oncogenic substrates. The Fbw7 pathway therefore has broad implications for cancer
biology and for the development of new therapeutic strategies. We will address important and unresolved
aspects of this pathway in two general areas. The first involves how phosphorylation and Fbw7 control Myc
stability and activity, in both normal cells and in cancers. The second area will address new paradigms in
the ways that Fbw7 recognizes substrates and how these interactions may underlie Fbw7 mutations in
cancers. This proposal may thus impact many areas of research related to Myc and the Fbw7 pathway.
Fbw7 binds substrates after they are phosphorylated within motifs termed degrons, that typically contain two
phosphorylated residues that interact with Fbw7. The first two Aims are focused on Myc regulation by
phosphorylation of a newly discovered Myc T244 degron that acts in concert with the canonical Myc T58
degron to bind Fbw7 dimers. Aim 1 will study how T244 degron phosphorylation is regulated in normal and
tumor cells and whether hierarchical Myc T244 degron phosphorylation controls Myc stability, as well as
how the T58 and T244 degrons are coordinately regulated by mitogenic and oncogenic signaling pathways.
Aim 2 will study the functions of the T244 degron in normal cells and tumorigenesis and how it cooperates
with the T58 degron. This will be accomplished through physiologic knockin models, in human cells and
mice, to create engineered Myc mutations that ablate Myc degron phosphorylations. Aim 3 will study how
Fbw7 dimers interact with substrates and how these interactions underlie Fbw7 mutations and their
functions in cancers. This includes determining the extent to which two separate degrons are required for
degradation across the Fbw7 substrate network. Identifying these new degrons may lead to entirely new
pathways that control the degradation of critical substrates and that may be abnormal in cancer cells.
Tumors often have heterozygous Fbw7 missense mutations that dimerize with wt-Fbw7, and the hypothesis
that these mutations specifically stabilize oncogenic substrates that require two degrons will be tested.
Finally, the Myc T244 degron binds Fbw7 through a novel mode that involves Fbw7 R689, a tumor hotspot,
and the role of R689 in dimer-dependent selective substrate recognition will be studied, as well as similar
possible functions for other Fbw7 missense mutations."

This P01 proposal offers a fresh approach to understanding the genetics of an extremely important polygenic
autoimmune disease: type 1 diabetes (T1D), which affects nearly three children out of every thousand in North
America, and many more around the world. T1D occurs with variable penetrance in Non-Obese Diabetic (NOD)
mice, which exhibit a phenotype remarkably similar to that of human patients. Both environmental and genetic
factors determine penetrance, but most of the influential mutations and the genes they affect remain unknown.
We have developed a powerful technology platform that permits instantaneous identification of point mutations
that cause phenotype. Using this platform, we have already identified two spontaneous mutations that cause
high and low frequency of disease development in the NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL sublines, respectively. Noting
that these sublines, isolated by selective breeding over a period of only seven years, had approximately the
same mutational distance from one another as one finds in a pedigree of ENU mutagenized mice as compared
to the parental reference strain, we performed a pilot study in which mice were mutagenized on the NOD/NckH
background. In a sample of 14 pedigrees, we unambiguously identified twelve ENU-induced mutations with
modifying effects on T1D: some accelerating the disease and others suppressing it. Stressing the precision of
these studies, which do not merely identify intervals or candidates, but resolve the exact nucleotide change
responsible for T1D modification, we propose to expand our efforts, analyzing 21,000 coding/splicing mutations
for modifier effects over a period of five years. Our preliminary work suggests that T1D is “balanced on a knife’s
edge” from a genetic point of view. Mutations in many genes are clearly capable of influencing T1D development,
since randomly induced coding/splicing mutations affecting approximately 1% of the mouse genome caused
unambiguous modifier phenotypes. We expect to identify scores if not hundreds of individual modifier mutations
during the period of funding. Some of these will have important new facts to tell us about what it takes to develop
T1D. Concentrating on those modifier mutations that show large effect sizes, may be amenable to targeting with
therapeutic drugs, and/or are particularly surprising in light of what we presently know about T1D pathogenesis,
we will rigorously verify causation by re-creating the mutations and/or deleting the causative genes on clean
backgrounds (NOD/NckH or NOD/NckL devoid of ENU-induced mutations). We will then systematically examine
the mechanism of phenotype modification, both at the level of cellular immuno-pathogenesis, and at the level of
molecular pathogenesis. Ultimately, we hope to understand how T1D can be prevented or driven into remission,
and we expect many new insights to emerge from the studies planned. A close collaboration between the
Bach/Chatenoud group, with its great expertise in the study of T1D pathogenesis in NOD mice, and the Beutler
group, with its strength in forward genetics, will contribute to the success of this P01. The Core laboratories and
Projects are exceptionally synergistic, assuring that this P01 will dramatically exceed the sum of its parts."

There is strong evidence that poor glycemic control in the hospital is common. Given the known
consequences of uncontrolled blood sugars during a hospitalization (e.g., infection, serious neurological
and cardiac complications, mortality, longer lengths of stay, readmissions, higher healthcare costs),
health systems devote significant resources to developing protocols for improving glucometrics.
Surprisingly, despite the widespread use and demonstrated effectiveness of continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) for ambulatory glucose management, CGMs are not currently used in any US
hospital. Therefore, the long-term goal to develop Cloud-Based Real-Time Glucose Evaluation and

processes, to provide a valuable test of real-world effectiveness, while capitalizing on standardized
algorithms to facilitate sustainability and scalability to other systems and at-risk populations. The
innovative intervention will enable hospital care teams to take immediate steps based on the wireless
transmission of glucose data from the Dexcom G6 device, sent to a Digital Dashboard, where
integration with existing real-world hospital processes can provide immediate prioritization to prevent or
correct impending hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemic events. The first step toward this long-term
goal is a randomized controlled trial, defined as a Phase III/IV definitive clinical trial that in turn
establishes efficacy and effectiveness of this intervention. Aim 1 will establish the effectiveness of
Cyber GEMS versus Usual Care (UC) in increasing the % time patients are in-range and decreasing %
time in hypoglycemia and severe hyperglycemia during hospitalization. Simultaneously, Aim 2 will
evaluate the effectiveness of Cyber GEMS versus UC in decreasing hospital-acquired infection risk.
The described Digital Dashboard is progressive, as it facilitates real-time, wireless transmission of
glucose data of a large volume of patients simultaneously; automatically identifies and prioritizes
patients for intervention; and detects potentially dangerous hypoglycemic episodes – all at a reduced
burden than current methods of stratification and review. The uninterrupted coverage by telemetry,
coupled with efficient and remote diabetes specialist oversight in Cyber GEMS is a scalable, novel,
team-based approach to maximize the use of continuously streaming CGM data for optimal glucose
management. The work proposed pushes the limits of these challenges by providing evidence,
identified by a team-based approach to glucose management in an underserved and understudied
population, supplementing prior data designed to improve outcomes among high-risk patients with T2D
and related cardiometabolic conditions."
10867379,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Developmental language disorder (DLD: 7% prevalence), defined by low language despite otherwise normal
development, puts children at greater risk for reading problems and lower vocational attainment. There exist
language-based disparities in the identification of DLD. Bilingual children are more likely over- or under-identified with DLD (Samson & Lesaux, 2009): Under-identification delays access to intervention, while over-identification misappropriates already scarce resources. DLD identification is particularly challenging during the
initial school years, when many bilinguals are in the processing of learning English as a second language.
Assessing children’s first language substantially improves diagnostic accuracy. The proposed project focuses
on Vietnamese, an understudied yet widely spoken language (1.5 million in the US, 100 million worldwide).
Vietnamese is highly distinct from English: Finding common clinical markers across contrastive languages
contributes to theoretical accounts of underlying mechanisms of the disorder. Our research team has the
expertise and local and global partnerships to search for clinical markers of DLD in Vietnamese. We have
pioneered the study of DLD in Vietnam by establishing a multi-method classification system for DLD in
kindergarten and by measuring language-reading development from kindergarten through second grade. In the US, we have defined parameters for typical development (TD) in Vietnamese bilinguals in the early school
years. The proposed study will recruit Vietnamese-speaking children, ages 4-6 years, in the US (bilingual
TD=100, DLD=25) and Vietnam (monolingual TD=160, DLD=40). Central hypothesis: There are Vietnamese
clinical markers that will confirm the presence or absence of DLD at the individual level, whether children are
learning Vietnamese alone or in combination with English. Aim 1 establishes the diagnostic accuracy of
nonword repetition and sentence repetition for Vietnamese monolinguals. We extend our prior work on these
tasks to a younger age (include 4yo) and a larger DLD sample. Aim 2 systematically compares four groups
(N=80, 20/group) of bilinguals (TD, DLD) and monolinguals (TD, DLD) matched by age, gender, and maternal
education, to capture emerging skills that can serve as grammatical markers of Vietnamese DLD. Aim 3
calculates the diagnostic accuracy of all clinical markers - grammar (accuracy, diversity, productivity), sentence
repetition, and nonword repetition- for bilinguals (n=125), monolinguals (n=200), and combined total sample
(N=325), which will serve as the most rigorous test of diagnostic accuracy. Impact: This project will help to
transform clinical language assessment procedures to serve our increasingly diverse society. Tools produced
from this project will improve diagnostic accuracy for Vietnamese-speaking children in the US and worldwide,
particularly Vietnamese-speaking children in the US who start school with minimal English proficiency, for
whom accurate identification heavily relies on first language skills. This study can serve as a model for other
Asian tonal languages that in combination with Vietnamese comprise 6.5 million speakers in the US."

Background and long-term objectives: Pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) is among the most lethal pediatric
cancers, and new targeted therapies are desperately needed. Approved therapies for pHGG remain non-
targeted and 2-year survival rates are less than 20%. Loss of function mutations in the chromatin remodeling
protein ATRX are found in 30% of pHGG and DIPG, usually with concurrent mutation in the histone variant
H3F3A (H3.3). We previously developed a mouse model of ATRX-deficient GBM and showed that loss of ATRX
results in increased sensitivity to radiation treatment. We recently discovered that HGG cells with isogenic ATRX
loss demonstrate inappropriate release of G1/S and G2/M checkpoint after irradiation and radio-sensitization
with inhibitors of the master cell cycle regulator ATM. However, the mechanism driving this phenotype has not
been established, and no models utilizing a background of pHGG mutations (e.g. H3.3) have been employed to
study ATRX loss. Thus, there is a critical need to determine how ATRX loss deregulates cell cycle checkpoints,
and to clarify the impact of concurrent H3F3A mutation on cell cycle regulation and radiation sensitizing therapy.
In the absence of such knowledge, the ability to translate therapies targeted to the cell cycle checkpoint deficit
in ATRX-deficient pHGG will remain unlikely.
Our overall objective in this proposal is to determine the epigenetic mechanism of cell cycle dysfunction in ATRX
mutated-pHGG and the impact/targetability of concurrent H3F3A mutation. Our central hypothesis is that ATRX
mutation in pHGG results in reduced H3.3-promotor binding and expression of the cell cycle checkpoint regulator
Checkpoint Kinase 1 (CHK1), leading to permissive cell cycle checkpoints after DNA damage. We propose that
co-occurrence of H3K27M mutation will enhance this deficit and increase radio-sensitization with ATM inhibition.
This is based on our preliminary data demonstrating (i) ATRX/H3.3 deposition at CHEK1 promoter sites, (ii)
reduction in Chk1 expression and checkpoint maintenance after irradiation in ATRX deficient models, and (iii)
increased cell cycle release with ATM inhibition in H3K27M cells compared to controls.
Specific Aim 1: Determine the mechanism of cell-cycle phase dysfunction in ATRX-deficient pHGG. We
will accomplish this by integrating complementary experimental approaches of multiple human and mouse pre-
clinical models of ATRX loss in pHGG, including epigenetic, cell cycle and DNA-damage repair experiments.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of co-occurring H3F3A mutation on the targetability of ATRX-
deficient pHGG. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating multiple human and mouse pre-clinical models of
ATRX loss in pHGG, including a novel genetically engineered mouse model with isogenic control of H3F3A
and ATRX, to isolate contribution of each driver on cell-cycle deficit and targetability.
Our integrative experimental approach will establish the mechanism behind the phenotypes we have recently
discovered and open new windows for therapies targeted to the unique features of ATRX-deficient pHGG."

Our intestine is host to a complex microbial community, the gut microbiota, which is dominated
by obligate anaerobic bacteria belonging to the classes Clostridia and Bacteroidia. This
community provides benefit to the host by contributing to nutrition, immune education and niche
protection against enteric pathogens (colonization resistance). However, Salmonella enterica
serovar (S.) Typhimurium can use its virulence factors to overcome colonization resistance by
triggering intestinal inflammation. The host inflammatory response remodels the intestinal
environment, which fuels growth of the pathogen, but also causes an imbalance in the microbiota
(dysbiosis). The question of how intestinal inflammation drives changes in the microbiota
composition and how these changes affect host physiology and pathogen expansion represents
a high-impact topic that will be addressed in this application. The objectives of this application are
to study the mechanisms that enable the pathogen to gain an edge over competing
Enterobacterales during intestinal inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that S. Typhimurium
virulence factors trigger host responses that remodel the intestinal environment to generate
resources that fuel pathogen growth while at the same time enabling it to edge out competing
Enterobacterales. To test this hypothesis, we will determine in Specific Aim 1 whether S.
Typhimurium benefits from intestinal inflammation because this host response increases the
availability of polyols. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine whether S. Typhimurium depletes a
neurotransmitter to compete with Enterobacterales for iron. Finally, our third specific aim will
determine whether sulfide production by S. Typhimurium provides a benefit during competition
with endogenous Enterobacterales. It is our expectation that successful completion of the
proposed experiments will usher in important conceptual advances in understanding the
mechanisms underlying pathogen expansion during S. Typhimurium-induced gastroenteritis."
10893624,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent advances in cancer immunotherapy have provided promising treatment options for patients with triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC). Despite overall success in treating these malignancies, immunotherapeutic ap-
proaches face a number of unique challenges: (1) dose limitation due to off-target side effects, (2) additive toxicity
of combination therapies, (3) and relatively low immunogenicity of breast cancer. To overcome these limitations,
this proposal seeks to engineer probiotic strains of bacteria that selectively colonize tumors of breast-cancer
origin and locally release therapeutics. The ultimate goal is to create clinic-ready strains that will efficiently local-
ize and release high-doses of therapeutics, while maintaining safety for patients.
 To do so, the accompanying project will focus on engineering genetically encoded encapsulation systems to
improve intravenous (IV) delivery of therapeutic bacteria for breast cancer therapy. In previous studies, we have
found that a single injection of a probiotic strain E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) can colonize multiple primary and
metastatic tumors of breast origin, relevant for TNBC patients that have metastatic disease across organs such
as the liver, brain, bone, and lung. However, in clinical trials with IV injection of genetically-attenuated bacteria,
less than 15% of patients demonstrated efficient colonization of tumors, although safe administration doses were
noted. Using synthetic biology approaches, we previously engineered EcN for transient induction of capsule
polysaccharides on the bacteria surface (termed iCAP), which increases maximally-tolerated doses in mice by
10-fold. In the first aim, we will genomically integrate this system and combine it with genetic attenuations used
in clinical trials, and other safety systems we have built. We will remove antibiotic markers from the probiotic
strain for future translation as well. Since humoral antibody responses to our EcN-iCAP will be generated in
humans, they will limit the efficacy of the system to generate multiple injections. Thus, we will next construct two
other encapsulation systems (polysialic acid, chondroitin), to enable sequential delivery of distinct strains. These
approaches will be characterized and tested through multiple in vitro assays and in mouse models.
 Altogether the approach of using engineered probiotics has several advantages over current therapeutic strat-
egies, including: (1) tumor-specific production of therapeutics, (2) bacteria lysis that leads to effective release of
novel therapeutics and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) adjuvant, and (3) enhanced efficacy and safety from combi-
nations and multiple encapsulation systems. This work seeks to overcome current limitations of immunothera-
pies, by providing a targeted vehicle to locally deliver therapeutics that stimulate antitumor immunity while pre-
venting systemic toxicity and mitigating immune-related adverse effects."
10876408,"Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development
Abstract
In the ﬁrst years of life, the human brain develops dynamically in both structure and function. Many neurodevel-
opmental disorders are associated with aberrations from normative growth during this critical period of early brain
development. The increasing availability of longitudinal baby MRI data, such as those acquired through the Baby
Connectome Project (BCP), affords unprecedented opportunity for precise charting of early brain developmental
trajectories in order to understand normative and aberrant growth. Dedicated computational tools are needed for
accurate processing and analysis of baby MR images, which typically exhibit dynamic heterogeneous changes
across time. The goal of this project is to equip brain researchers with computational tools effective for studying
the early developing human brain in terms of tissue microstructure and white matter pathways using diffusion
MRI.
We propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop computational tools for effective estimation of white matter
pathways in the baby brain via diffusion tractography. We will tackle the challenge of tracking through regions
with low diffusion anisotropy owing to ongoing myelination in the developing brain. Our tools will allow proper
characterization of complex white matter pathway patterns such as fanning and bending. This will allow solving
the gyral bias problem ubiquitous in existing tractography algorithms with ﬁber streamlines terminating predomi-
nantly at gyral crowns but not sulcal banks. Our tools will allow tracing of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical
pathways with more uniform coverage of the cortex. In Aim 2, we will develop microstructural analysis meth-
ods that are unconfounded by complex ﬁber conﬁgurations, such as crossing, bending, branching, kissing, and
fanning, allowing more accurate and speciﬁc characterization of changes in tissue microarchitecture during early
brain development. In Aim 3, we will develop techniques that will allow diffusion MRI data collected at multiple
sites, which are very common in the era of big data, to be harmonized to mitigate the negative effects of inter-site
variability. Unlike existing methods that harmonize derived quantities such as fractional anisotropy, our method
can be applied directly to the diffusion-weighted images, allowing measurements based on microstructure and
connectivity to be subsequently computed for consistent analysis. We will also develop deep learning tools for
multi-shell data prediction so that diffusion MRI data collected with different numbers of shells can be harmonized.
Successful completion of this project will empower the neuroscience community with computational tools to better
chart the normative early development of the human brain using diffusion MRI. The developed tools will also
enable quantitative brain examinations of children who are affected by neurological developmental disorders."
10873824,"The mission of the Cell and Molecular Biology (CMB) program at Washington University in St. Louis is to
provide rigorous interdisciplinary training to a diverse group of PhD students in four related disciplines in order
to prepare them for successful careers in the biomedical workforce. It will provide students with the
fundamental concepts and methods of cellular and molecular biology, quantitative training, critical thinking and
communication skills, and other core competencies. The goal of our renowned and committed faculty is to
provide students with a firm foundation in rigorous research design via a holistic approach that includes high-
quality mentoring and fostering career development in a vibrant student-focused research environment. Our
training opportunities embody the breadth of cell and molecular biology to tackle challenges in human health
using systems from viruses and microbes to mammals. Over 100 core facilities support our research and
training mission, providing trainees with platforms to learn and utilize cutting-edge technology. The objective of
the CMB training program is to enable our students to pursue careers at the vanguard of scientific research
and education by helping them establish a broad scientific knowledge and professional skills, rich career
preparation guidance and resources, and an interdisciplinary network of colleagues. The CMB training program
will support 25 trainees for 2 years. Half of the trainees will be in year 2 and the other half will be in year 3 of
the program. These are pivotal years in the training path towards successful independent research. The CMB
program is highly integrated and will have a profound impact on the training of more than just our training
grant-supported students. Measurable outcomes include PhD completion rates, time-to-degree, program
reviews by internal and external faculty, longitudinal tracking of student development and self-efficacy in core
competencies. Most importantly, the pinnacle of success of the CMB training program is the ability of our
students to achieve their career ambitions in the biomedical workforce. This proposal builds on our successes
by introducing both proven and innovative educational features including five new initiatives: 1) Updated
curriculum, including a novel skills competency course (an outcome of our program evaluations and student-
need centered improvement processes); 2) Improved mentor training processes, including development of new
cross-cultural mentor training; 3) Holistic admissions and trainee appointment processes, including removal of
GRE requirement; 4) Enhanced training in rigor and reproducibility in core courses and thesis committee
meetings; 5) Earlier and more directed focus on career exploration and experiences. The CMB program
employs a continuous improvement process informed by internal and external reviewers and evidence-based
assessments to develop and implement effective new training methods."

HIV broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are effective against the virus, but cannot be elicited through
vaccination due to genetic limitations imposed by the human repertoire of B cell antigen-receptors (BCRs). We
have recently shown that mature primary B cells from wild-type mice can be engineered ex vivo to express
bnAb genes as functional antigen receptors, and that these cells can be returned to the host and vaccinated to
generate durable bnAb responses. Because this animal model cannot support HIV infection, therapeutic or
protective efficacy of these responses have not yet been evaluated. The proposal described here: 1) Explores
novel B cell targeting approaches that aim to improve how B cells are engineered and function in vivo; 2)
Defines vaccine parameters and the properties of engineered cells required for reproducible elicitation of
durable bnAb responses in the mouse model and; 3) Translates our successful ‘Engineered B cell Vaccine’
(EBcV) prototype to the rhesus macaque animal model for efficacy testing using chimeric HIV/SIV viruses
(SHIVs). BnAbs elicited in non-human primates (NHP) will be tested for their ability to prevent heterologous
tier-2 virus infection, suppress, or maintain suppression of viremia, in order to evaluate the potential for EBcVs
to function as prophylactic vaccines or as an HIV functional cure. Such an approach may have significant
advantages over other gene therapy strategies that aim to durably secrete bnAbs from muscle or liver cells.
When elicited from modified B cells, bnAb responses should be: 1) able to mature in affinity in response to a
rapidly evolving pathogen; 2) increase titers in the presence of antigen; 3) be expressed as all effector
isotypes; 4) tolerated by the immune system because they originate from B cells and; 5) subject to tolerance
mechanisms that should inactivate the cells expressing them if they are harmful. All studies designed in this
proposal support our long-term goal, the development of safe, effective and economically feasible ‘Engineered
B cell vaccines’ that would generate durable HIV bnAb responses from genome modified B cells as a strategy
for prevention or HIV functional cure."

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are critical for the maintenance of immunological tolerance but more recently their
importance in regulating other aspects of tissue homeostasis has been an area of intense interest. Most
relevant to this application are populations of tissue-resident Tregs that accumulate upon injury and facilitate
tissue repair by producing factors such as the EGF family member amphiregulin (Areg). These repair functions
are distinct from the suppressive function classically attributed to Tregs, but the signals that instruct Tregs to
adopt these distinct functional modalities have not been well defined. The IL-1 family cytokines IL-18 and IL-33
are involved at some level, at least in certain tissues, but it remains unclear whether these cytokines act as the
key initial determinants of Treg function.
This proposal will test the hypothesis that Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) signaling in Tregs is a key determinant of
Treg tissue repair function. We propose that TLR7 enables Tregs to sense pathogen-derived nucleic acids as
well as self RNA released from damaged host tissues. Our hypothesis is based on our analysis of a panel of
TLR reporter mice, which revealed that only TLR7 is expressed on Tregs, as well as strong preliminary data
demonstrating that TLR7 can induce expression of the signature tissue repair gene, Areg, in both murine and
human Tregs. Using newly generated mice with Treg-specific deletion of TLR7, we will examine the
importance of TLR7 signaling in Tregs during lung damage (Aim 1). Single-cell RNA sequencing will identify
which subsets of lung Tregs are controlled by TLR7 and will define TLR7-dependent genes in Tregs. We will
also investigate the importance of IL18R and IL33R signaling in Tregs, using mice with Treg-specific deletion
of these receptors, and will determine the extent to which TLR7, IL18R, and IL33R regulate distinct aspects of
Treg expansion and/or differentiation in response to diverse lung damaging agents (Aim 2). Finally, we will
build on our recent work that identified a mechanism by which the TLR chaperone Unc93b1 specifically
dampens TLR7 signaling. Using Tregs from mice with mutant Unc93b1 that have enhanced TLR7 signaling,
we will test whether adoptive therapy of Tregs with enhanced TLR7 responses to viral and self RNA can
mediate more effective repair of lung damage (Aim 3).
Altogether, these studies will define the signals that control Treg tissue repair functions and test the therapeutic
potential of amplifying these signals in the context of lung damage, a key first step toward therapeutic
manipulation of Treg function for clinical benefit."

Neutrophils are not often considered as cancer killing immune cells in the same way that natural killer cells,
cytotoxic T cells and macrophages. However, the inherent capability of neutrophils to be cytotoxic is clinically
evident in diseases of hyperinflammation (such as sepsis) where activated neutrophils contribute to organ failure
by destroying otherwise healthy cells and tissues. Therefore, neutrophils possess all the cytolytic machinery
needed to be destructive to host tissues and we propose that includes cancer. What is lacking is a clearly defined
targeting mechanism that can focus the cytotoxic potential of neutrophils towards cancer cells in a specific and
controlled manner. This proposal will present published and preliminary evidence that neutrophils can indeed
be successfully targeted to cancer cells leading to a newly described non-apoptotic cancer killing mechanism
called trogoptosis. Trogoptosis (Greek: trogo; “gnaw”) is a newly described effector mechanism that brings
neutrophils into the discussion of tumor killing immune cells. Trogoptosis is a form of antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) that triggers neutrophils to destroy antibody-opsonized tumor targets by forming a transient
receptor-mediated synapse between the neutrophil and the tumor target. Killing occurs as a result of the
neutrophil gnawing at the tumor plasma membrane and dismembering it into chunks, and is distinct from
apoptosis and necrosis. Neutrophils internalize these pieces of tumor cells by phagocytosis and migrate away.
Trogoptosis is dependent on the neutrophil beta2 integrin Complement Receptor 3 (CR3; CD11b/CD18; Mac-1).
Antibody blockade of CR3, or neutrophils from families with genetic absence of CR3, obviate trogoptosis. Given
the relative recency of this discovery, there remains much to be learned about this effector mechanism.
 A highly selected experimental plan is offered to fit within the budget and timeframe of an R03 yet allow
rigorous testing of the hypothesis that neutrophil trogoptosis is a function that can be enhanced by agonists of
neutrophil CR3 and augment the efficacy of anti-cancer antibody therapy. This R03 would develop a nascent
collaboration between two laboratories with a track record in the use of biomimetic experimental systems to
study breast cancer invasion and the function of human neutrophils. The experimental approach will use fibrous
gels of varying stiffnesses and ECM composition that reflect differences that exist among various bodily tissues
and organs. MDA-231 TNBC will be modeled as single invasive cells (Specific Aim 1) and as 3D spheroids
(Specific Aim 2) in testing the trogoptoptic killing by human neutrophils introduced as tumoricidal effector cells.
Additional work will determine if neutrophil CR3 is a druggable target that can enhance the effectiveness of
neutrophil-dependent tumor killing and thereby potentially serve as an adjuvant to anti-tumor antibody therapy
in the clinic. Our overall objective is to demonstrate that human neutrophils can be stimulated to function
effectively and specifically as tumoricidal immune cells."

Human biomonitoring (HBM) – the measurement of a chemical, its reaction product, or metabolite in
biosamples – is an exposure assessment technique that is often considered the “gold standard” in exposure
assessment. The US uses the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as a vehicle for
sample collection for its national HBM program. NHANES data collection occurs in Mobile Examination
Centers (MEC), large trailers containing a mobile laboratory. Scheduling site locations for data collection
includes considerations such as seasonal weather patterns and difficulties with MEC unit transit. Because
MEC units cannot easily traverse difficult roadways with snow and ice patching, logistics require that sampling
in areas often hit with harsh winter weather occur during the warmer months (i.e., spring and summer) whereas
more temperate locations can be sampled in cooler months (i.e., winter and autumn). Given this, NHANES
data that may vary by season could be subject to both temporal and spatial bias. This potential bias could, in
turn, lead to inaccurate interpretations of population exposure and health data. We will evaluate any bias in
HBM data of seasonal chemicals from NHANES using two specific aims. 1) Conduct state-level and seasonal
evaluations of distributions of seasonal and non-seasonal chemical urinary biomarkers in NHANES Cycles
1999-2016 using the NCHS Research Data Center allowing access to restricted geocodes and sampling dates.
2) Compare NHANES state-level urinary pesticide metabolite data to smaller-scale biomonitoring studies
conducted in different US states during different seasons. This study could provide information that will enable
CDC to reconsider their sampling logistics to better represent seasonal and regional variations or will enable us
to quantify the extent to which NHANES underestimates US population exposures."

10830297,"Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in men and women and the second
leading cause of cancer related death. Screening for CRC reduces CRC incidence and
mortality, and is recommended for average risk men and women between the ages of 45 and 75
by the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines; which were updated recently to include
45-49 year olds, an additional 20 million individuals in the US. In New York City screening rates
are 78% in Manhattan but only 26-55% in federally qualified Health Centers (FQHC) across the
city that provide free and subsidized health services to underrepresented minorities. Currently,
invitations to screen are offered only when a patient is seen by his or her provider.
Consequently, many eligible individuals, particularly 45-55 year olds who do not regularly
access healthcare, are under-screened. Hence, there is an unmet need for improving screening
practices. We hypothesize that patient care (rates of CRC screening) will improve in under-
served populations with the implementation of a proactive approach that incorporates a mailed
outreach invitation to screen, followed by active assistance to a colonoscopy completion
including overcoming financial and logistical barriers. To address this hypothesis, we seek to
improve CRC screening in a hybrid type I trial by assessing the effectiveness and
implementation of a proactive outreach colorectal cancer screening program in multiple federally
qualified health centers (FQHCs) in Brooklyn, serving primarily Black patients. This proposed
work will provide critical, foundational information for scaling up long-term, sustained
implementation of screening program across other FQHCs in NYC. We propose to perform a
randomized trial of proactive invitation at five FQHCs with aims to study the effect of a
proactive outreach program that identifies those due for screening, mail a fecal immunochemical
test and provide navigation and financial support for cost of preparation and transport to usual
care in improving CRCc screening rates, understand barriers and facilitators to proactive
outreach by surveying patients and providers, and perform a cost analysis of the program"

 Desymmetrizing activation of prochiral C–H bonds via metal insertion has emerged as a potentially
transformative approach for the rapid and divergent synthesis of chiral compounds. However, a significant
challenge prohibiting the broad utility of this approach is the poor reactivity of native substrates in the absence
of externally-appended directing groups. This proposal directly addresses this challenge by developing two
approaches to achieve the enantioselective C–H activation of a range of native substrates commonly found in
organic synthesis and drug discovery—carboxylic acids, ketones, aldehydes and amines: (A) Development of
chiral bidentate L,X-type ligands containing N-acetyl or pyridone motifs to accelerate C–H cleavage; (B)
Development of chiral transient directing groups (TDGs) to enable enantioselective C–H activation of ketones,
aldehydes and amines. Following initial discoveries of chiral ligands and TDGs, we will then develop various
catalytic cycles to enable the enantioselective C–H activation of diverse native substrates, forming a range of
carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds asymmetrically. These novel reactions will provide a versatile
platform for the construction of -, -, and -stereocenters. These technologies will be applied to drug
discovery in collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry and academic laboratories. Specifically, the one-
step access to the atypical chiral -lactones and lactams via enantioselective C–H activation will be applied to
the discovery of covalent inhibitors for serine hydrolases and cysteine-dependent proteins using activity-based
protein profiling."

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has demonstrated significant clinical benefit in late-stage patients
with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, bladder cancer, non-small
cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, and for all microsatellite-
unstable tumors. A major limitation of ICB therapies targeting the CTLA4 or PD1 immune checkpoints is that a
significant portion of patients will experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which can result in
permanent or even fatal toxicity and discontinuation of life-saving immunotherapy. Compounding this problem
is the fact that there currently exist no molecular modulators for ICB-driven irAEs. This R01 application
examines circulating LPC 18:2 a novel small molecule modulator and therapeutic for irAEs by studying human
cancer patients and relevant preclinical models of ICB-driven irAEs and tumor regression. The proposed aims
will systematically i) examine association between LPC 18:2 and irAEs across multiple human cancer cohorts
(e.g. melanoma, non small lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) and ICB therapies (e.g. anti-
CTLA4 ipilimumab, anti-PD1 pembrolizumab and combination therapies); ii) examine relationship between
plasma LPC 18:2 levels and ICB-driven tumor regression or natural autoimmune disease; iii) study the
immunological mechanisms by which LPC 18:2 restrains ICB-driven irAEs and autoimmune colitis; iv)
mechanistically probe novel effects of LPC 18:2 and LPC-G2A signaling on development and function of
inflammatory neutrophils. This study uses a highly innovative approach leveraging cancer patient bio-sampling
across multiple independent clinical trials with state-of-the-art rapid mass spectrometry profiling of small
molecule metabolites and mechanistic studies. This is a collaborative study between a cancer immunologist
and basic scientist at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and UCSD Moores Cancer Center, an analytical
chemist at UCSD, a statistical epidemiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, clinical immune-oncology

10851935,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is marked by progressive neuropathological changes that begin decades before
cognitive and functional symptoms, and thus efforts have been focused on developing innovative tools
and biomarkers for early identification of pre-dementia stages. To date, clinical ability to identify those with
pre-dementia stages of AD has been limited and requires expensive (amyloid PET) or invasive (lumbar
puncture) testing. However, subtle changes in connected speech may be detectable years before overt
disease symptoms present. Our team has developed an approach that uses machine learning and natural
language processing combined with advanced acoustic phonetic and lexical-semantic analyses.
Preliminary data show promise in identifying AD biomarker status and predicting 2-year cognitive
progression. In the proposed study, we leverage our success in collecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
biomarkers, neuroimaging and detailed cognitive phenotyping combined with audio recordings of
participants in the Brain Stress, Hypertension and Aging Research Program cohort. This cohort, now in its
third year of follow-up, consists of 400 individuals 50 years or older with normal cognition or mild
cognitive impairment. We plan to extend this cohort of 400 participants for 3 more years to collect
additional waves of voice recordings, cognitive assessments, follow-up CSF biomarkers and
neuroimaging. Our overarching hypothesis is that the derived novel features reflecting poor lexical-
semantic connectedness or acoustic perturbations are significantly different between biomarker-positive
and -negative participants, have better diagnostic performance with regards to the ATN framework than
traditional cognitive tests and can track disease progression. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the
accuracy of the derived digital biomarkers in detecting in-vivo AD pathology and ATN classification in the B-
SHARP cohort; 2) Investigate the association of the derived digital biomarkers with disease progression
and cognitive decline; and 3) Investigate the ability of repeated measurement of the digital biomarkers to
track disease progression. This project will provide needed insight into the use of non-invasive digital
biomarkers to improve the ability to detect and track longitudinal changes in cognitive and functional status
in AD and will set the foundation for a future larger pivotal study."

Program Summary
The goal of Colorado’s Produce Safety Program is to improve produce safety in a historically
unregulated industry and to provide consumers with safe, nutritious produce grown, harvested,
packed or held in Colorado. To achieve the goal the Program will collaborate with the FDA and
utilize both the regulatory and educational fronts to achieve compliance with the Rule.
The Program will utilize staff dedicated directly to the Produce Safety Program’s administration
as well as administrative and inspection staff shared within the Inspection and Consumer
Services Division. This seasonal use of permanent staff will allow the Program to retain more
field staff trained to conduct inspections which primarily occur over a three month period. To
address the educational needs the Program will work with Colorado State University (CSU) to
conduct PSA Grower Training and do On-Farm Readiness Reviews under a sub award with the
CO Department of Agriculture. The Program will also develop relationships with trade groups,
and key industry stakeholders to increase awareness to the Produce Safety Rule.
Colorado passed legislation and adopted rules consistent with the Federal Rule including the
authority to conduct inspections, so long as sufficient funding to support the program was
provided by the FDA. The legislation also provided the program with the authority to establish a
mandatory registration program and administer civil penalties.
We believe that achieving a high rate of compliance can be achieved through development of
strong industry partnerships, education and regulatory enforcement. Utilizing FDA resources in
a collaborative manner along with expertise within the state to address the unique produce
landscape of Colorado’s industry will result in a Program that is consistent with the objectives of
the Produce Safety Rule and a consistent National Produce Safety Program.
To achieve this goal Colorado is requesting Path C Regulatory funding of $253,500 Band 9
based on our Farm Inventory and $270,000 for Farm Inventory and Education Band 6 based on
2017 NASS data for a total of $523,500 for the first year of the cooperative agreement."
10886604,"Iowa (IA) Path A: Project Summary/Abstract
Advancing Iowa's Efforts in Continuing to Attain High Rates of Compliance with
the FDA's Produce Safety Rule through Education, Outreach & Technical
Assistance to Iowa Growers
In March 2021 the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship (IDALS) was made
aware of the FDA FOA# PAR-21-174. Continuing and strengthening work conducted under
PAR-16-167, IDALS convened its Produce Safety Rule steering committee and began
development of a five-year project plant to advance compliance with the FDA’s Produce Safety
Rule with Iowa’s fruit and vegetable growers. As with PAR-16-137, the state will continue to
conduct program objectives aligned with outreach, education, and technical assistance as well
as farm inventory development as outlined in Path A of PAR-21-174. With support of its
partners, the Iowa Department of Agricultural and Land Stewardship’s new five-year program
will align with the four objectives as outlined in the program announcement for Path A. While
the program will continue the overall goal to enhance production of safe produce, the program
will advance this aim by using and amending a living project plan as well as a written
assessment of Iowa’s produce farms to be submitted at the end of Year 1. The living project
plan has been initiated and is submitted in its first iteration with this funding opportunity
submission by IDALS. These documents will capture the program’s administrative capacities,
provisions for educational opportunities, outreach strategies, technical assistance offerings, and
the management of the state’s farm inventory.
A further emphasis will be on the continuance of a building strong partnerships with the sub-
awardee, Produce Safety Rule colleagues at other state programs, FDA personnel, and NASDA
– as well as state stakeholders via a proposed Produce Safety Stakeholder Advisory Board.
Farm inventory verification and updating is emphasized along with outreach, training, and
technical support strategies."
10833642,"Little is known about the relationship between hypertension (HTN) and auditory dysfunction in the Black adult
population and to what extent it differs from that in White persons. Experimental work shows the cochlea is
irreversibly damaged in HTN, making early identification of cochlear dysfunction in persons with this modifiable
condition critical to reducing the disease burden of age-related hearing loss (ARHL). It is also known that HTN
disproportionately affects Black persons. The long-term goal of this line of research is to reduce the public health
burden of ARHL by devising clinical efforts for early identification and intervention of persons with modifiable
determinants of acquired hearing loss. The overall objective of this application is to assess cochlear function in
Stage 2 HTN (a severe elevation in blood pressure) and characterize differences in this relationship between
Black and White adults. The central hypothesis, supported by past studies and the applicant’s preliminary data,
is that, compared to normotensives, outer hair cell health is compromised in persons with Stage 2 HTN and that
White adults experience greater compromise than Black adults. The rationale for this work is that once the extent
of auditory damage in Stage 2 HTN is determined, clinical protocols for early evaluation of auditory vulnerability
in persons with HTN can be established, which will support earlier intervention.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) assess functional integrity of the cochlea
in persons with Stage 2 HTN and (2) characterize Black-White differences in the association between Stage 2
HTN and cochlear dysfunction. Adults aged 18-85 years with normal blood pressure (controls) or Stage 2 HTN
will undergo extensive behavioral and swept-tone distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) testing.
Under Aim 1, swept-tone DPOAEs will be collected from f2 of 1-20 kHz. Under Aim 2, linear mixed effects
modeling will disentangle the effects of HTN, race, sex, and potential confounders on auditory function with a
focus on cochlear health. Innovation aspects of this research include the methodological approach (swept-tone
high-frequency DPOAEs), statistical modeling (which will disambiguate the effects of HTN from other contributors
to ARHL), and assessment of racial differences. The proposed research is significant because it is a vital step
in devising clinical efforts for early identification and intervention of persons with modifiable determinants of
acquired hearing loss and will provide critically needed data on cochlear dysfunction in Black adults, a historically
under-studied population. Capturing auditory dysfunction early in the disease process is important because
hearing loss, even in the subclinical stage, is associated with negative outcomes. Ultimately, knowledge gained
from this research will inform development of clinical tools and protocols to improve early identification of auditory
dysfunction in persons with medical comorbidities such as Stage 2 HTN with the end goal of advancing more
effective therapeutic solutions."
10871866,"Abstract
 Sepsis is a frequently encountered critical care syndrome leading to 250, 000 deaths annually, making it
one of the leading causes of mortality in the U.S. Despite over 75 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), no
treatments have shown a survival benefit and currently there are no approved therapies for sepsis. The multitude
of negative RCTs has been attributed to the clinical and biological heterogeneity subsumed within the non-
specific clinical definition of sepsis. The failed therapies in the context of vast heterogeneity makes sepsis ideal
for precision medicine-based approaches where targeted therapies are used in biologically-informed subgroups.
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is another critical care syndrome with significant
heterogeneity. In secondary analyses of five ARDS RCTs, we consistently identified two phenotypes, the
hyperinflammatory and hypoinflammatory phenotypes, with divergent clinical outcomes, biomarker profiles and
differential responses to therapies. Crucially, in an RCTs that only recruited sepsis-associated ARDS, the
corresponding two phenotypes emerged again. Our preliminary data, in a separate cohort of 587 patients with
sepsis, also identified these two phenotypes. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the molecular
phenotypes previously identified in ARDS are also evident in sepsis, and that they represent distinct biologic
subtypes characterized by differences in circulating inflammatory responses. Using latent class analysis with a
composite of clinical and biomarker data, we will seek phenotypes in four independent cohorts of sepsis (>4000
patients). We will develop clinically implementable models to classify the phenotypes using previously described
algorithmic pipelines. Heterogeneous treatment effect in the phenotypes will be sought in CLOVERS, a
multicenter RCT comparing fluid resuscitation strategies in severe sepsis. In a prospective cohort, we will study
novel techniques such as next-generation sequencing, mass cytometry and functional immune responses in
stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells to better understand the biological and immunological
characteristics of the phenotypes and identify phenotype-specific treatable traits. We will also study the
phenotypes longitudinally to evaluate their temporal stability. This proposal represents an independent niche of
research for my group, which has the requisite experience and expertise to successfully deliver this program.
 The culmination of the program will potentially lead to several highly impactful discoveries with important
implications for sepsis care. We anticipate identifying robust and reproducible phenotypes of sepsis in multiple
cohorts, with phenotype-specific response to therapies. We will develop practical models that can identify
phenotypes at the bedside. We will comprehensively map the biological and immunological profiles of the
phenotypes to identify treatable traits that may enable precision-based approaches in sepsis. Finally, the finding
of equivalence of sepsis and ARDS phenotypes would represent a paradigm-changing discovery, leading to a
novel classification system of critical illness agnostic of syndromic diagnosis."
10892194,"Trigeminal nerve injury pain remains a significant problem both because of its intensity and persistence, and the
absence of consistently effective therapeutic options. The clinical observations that the anti-seizure drug
carbamazepine (CBZ) has generally failed in the treatment of somatic nerve injury pain, but helps with trigeminal
nerve injury pain, at least temporarily, suggests it may be possible to identify more effective treatments for
trigeminal nerve injury pain by identifying the basis for the difference(s) between somatic and trigeminal nerves
in response to injury. Pursuing this possibility, we confirmed that CBZ was more effective at relieving ongoing
pain and mechanical hypersensitivity in rats associated with an injury to trigeminal than a somatic nerve. Because
the same injury (chronic constriction injury (CCI)) was applied to the sciatic nerve (SN) and the infraorbital nerve
(ION), these data suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of CBZ reflects a unique response to injury rather than a
unique feature of the way the nerve is injured in patients. Consistent with this suggestion we observed an
increase in the potency and efficacy of CBZ-induced block of action potential propagation in isolated nerves
following ION-CCI but not SN-CCI. This suggests that the therapeutic selectivity of CBZ is due, at least in part,
to an action on primary afferents. Our observations that ION-CCI was associated with an increase in NaV1.1
protein and the efficacy of an NaV1.1 preferring channel blocker suggest that this subunit may not only contribute
to trigeminal nerve injury pain, but the therapeutic selectivity of CBZ (generally thought of as a voltage-gated Na+
channel (VGSC) blocker). CBZ is also a GABAA receptor agonist and we observed an ION-CCI-induced increase
in the potency and efficacy of CBZ on the isolated trigeminal nerve that was reversed by a GABAA receptor
blocker. Furthermore, ION-CCI but not SN-CCI was associated with an increase in expression of GABAAρ3, and
hypersensitivity associated with ION-CCI, but not SN-CCI was attenuated by a GABAA receptor agonist with
activity at GABAA receptors with ρ-subunits. These discoveries uniquely positioned us to determine why the site
of nerve injury influences the efficacy of CBZ. We have proposed to do so in experiments described under three
Specific Aims designed to test the hypothesis that the ongoing pain and hypersensitivity associated with
trigeminal but not somatic nerve injury are due to an increase in NaV1.1, while the selective therapeutic
effect of CBZ is due to an increase in both NaV1.1 and GABAAρ3 receptors along the trigeminal nerve.
In Aims 1 and 2 we will determine the contribution of VGSCs and GABAA receptor subtypes to trigeminal nerve
injury-induced hypersensitivity and the selective therapeutic utility of CBZ. Finally, to validate these preclinical
observations, in Aim 3 we will characterize the functional VGSCs and GABAA receptor subunits in human
trigeminal and somatic nerves, including trigeminal nerves from patients suffering from trigeminal pain. Together,
the results of these experiments will increase our understanding of the role of two key channel types in
neuropathic pain and may suggest more effective ways to treat pain associated with trigeminal nerve injury."
10831534,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Changes in cellular glycosylation support cancer growth and progression, but the biosynthetic pathways that
supply the required nucleotide-sugar precursors are resource intensive. The cell therefore utilizes salvage
pathways to recycle free sugars following glycan degradation or extracellular uptake, offsetting the need for their
de novo synthesis. Little is known about the extent to which cancer cells rely on sugar salvage pathways or how
these pathways are regulated. Recently, the salvage kinase responsible for phosphorylating N-
acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) for reuse by the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine kinase
(NAGK), was found to support tumor growth, providing early evidence that cancer cells may indeed rely heavily
on salvage. Preliminary data presented here show that NAGK is deprotonated at two cysteines in response to
nutrient limitation, a condition frequently encountered in the tumor microenvironment. Cysteine deprotonation
can alter protein activity and promote subsequent oxidation. This deprotonation is observed not just on NAGK,
but on proteins throughout the cell in what may be a previously unrecognized adaptation to stress. Cysteines,
especially in the deprotonated thiolate state, serves as ready sites of covalent inhibition by small molecule
electrophiles. Thus, the wide-spread increase in thiolates in response to nutrient limitation may represent a class
of proteins that are more responsive to covalent inhibition within stressed tumor cells than when in their
protonated thiol state in healthy, perfused tissue. The aims detailed in this proposal will first characterize the
effect of cysteine deprotonation on NAGK activity and its role in tumor growth and will then focus on identifying
the global changes in cysteine protonation status in response to nutrient limitation as well as the environmental
factors that promote this deprotonation. This work will characterize, both mechanistically and broadly, a novel
stress response that may promote tumor progression despite nutrient limitation but that may also render the
tumor more vulnerable to therapeutic intervention with small molecule electrophiles."
10886556,"Project Summary
There is immense interindividual clinical variability in humans infected with SARS-CoV-2, ranging from silent
infection to lethal COVID-19. The first breakthrough to crack this enigma came from the field of inborn errors of
immunity (IEI). In an international cohort of 659 patients, we reported 23 patients with IEIs at eight influenza
susceptibility loci that govern TLR3- and IRF7-dependent type I interferon (IFN) immunity (3.5%), including four
unrelated patients with autosomal recessive IRF7 or IFNAR1 deficiency. We also reported an additional 101
patients with neutralizing autoantibodies (auto-Abs) against type I IFN (10.2% of 987), who were auto-immune
phenocopies of the patients with IEI. Interestingly, 94% of the patients with auto-Ab against type I IFN were men,
and one of the six sick women had X-linked dominant incontinentia pigmenti (IP), suggesting X-linked inheritance
in at least some of the patients. Collectively, these patients account for about 13.5% of life-threatening COVID-
19 cases studied. We now hypothesize that other IEI that result in abnormal (i) production or amplification of
type I IFN, (ii) activity of soluble type I IFNs (via neutralizing auto-Abs), or (iii) response to type I IFN (in terms of
interferon stimulated gene (ISG) activity), can underlie life-threatening COVID-19 in other patients. To tackle
these three specific aims, we benefit from an international recruitment from the COVID Human Genetic Effort
(https://www.covidhge.com). Our preliminary data are very strong. First, we have found 215 patients with
predicted loss-of-function (pLOF) variants at 157 loci associated with production or amplification of type I IFN,
including one patient homozygous for a pLOF variants in NLRC3, two patients heterozygous for pLOF variants
in DDX58/RIG-I, and six patients heterozygous for pLOF variants in subtypes of type I or III IFNs. Second, among
patients with auto-Ab against type I IFN, we identified a patient hemizygous for a pLOF in X-linked SASH3. In
addition, we found that 25% of patients with IP, which is associated with severely skewed X-inactivation, have
auto-Ab against type I IFN, further suggesting an X-linked basis of auto-Ab to type I IFN production. Third, we
found 24 patients with pLOF variants in 18 ISGs. We have shown that the international path-breaking program
we established in only 6 months is highly efficient, as it resulted in a paradigm-shifting discovery. Our new
program will benefit from this momentum. Our future discoveries of new inborn errors of type I IFN immunity
underlying life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia will pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies
to better manage patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 at risk of severe disease. Selected patients may benefit
from subcutaneous or nebulized IFN-a or IFN-b (defect in type I IFN production or amplification), plasmapheresis
and/or B cell depletion (neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs), or other therapies, including mAbs against
SARS-CoV-2 (defects of ISGs)."
10867371,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) is a sexually-transmitted gram-negative bacterium that causes inflammation and
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In the U.S., the incidence of Ng is rising dramatically. Alarmingly, Ng has
become increasingly resistant to all approved antibiotics.
Interferon-epsilon (IFN-e) is a type I IFN that is highly expressed by epithelial cells of the female urogenital tract
(both in mice and humans) but not in leukocytes. IFN-e, unlike the other type I IFNs, is not induced by bacterial
“pathogen-associated molecular patterns,” such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or nucleic acids. Rather, IFN-e is
regulated by sex hormones in the urogenital tract. We discovered that estrogen contributes to Ng infection by
inducing the expression of IFN-e. Estrogen treatment dramatically prolongs Ng infection of the female genital
tract. Type I IFNs, including IFN-e, share a common receptor, the IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR). Our data
using IFNAR and IFN-e knockout (KO) animals, as well as blocking mAbs to IFNAR, strongly support the
hypothesis that estrogen-induced type I IFNs contribute to Ng immune evasion. In the absence of IFNAR
signaling, Ng is virtually incapable of maintaining colonization of the female urogenital tract. Furthermore, local
administration of recombinant IFN-e (rIFN-e) protein completely reverted the phenotype to resemble the wild-
type mice. Preliminary studies suggest that this may be related to regulation of cationic antimicrobial peptides
(CAMP), such as CRAMP, as well as the sialylation of Ng lipooligosaccharide (LOS). We hypothesize that
estrogen-induced IFN-e is required for productive Ng infection because it regulates the availability of sialic acid
precursors to Ng sialyltransferase, thus, allowing Ng to evade AMP killing.
In Aim 1, we will assess the impact of estrogen and IFN-e on gene expression in epithelial cells in the female
genital tract during infection using both mouse and human models of Ng infection. We will use proteomics and
gene expression approaches to determine if IFN-e regulates the expression of CAMPs and complement proteins
in the genital tract. In Aim 2, we will determine how IFNAR-expressing cell types promote Ng survival. We will
also assess the impact of type I IFN on the intrinsic bactericidal activity of phagocytes and their recruitment to
the genital tract. In Aim 3, we will assess the impact of IFN-e on Ng genes, particularly genes that regulate
CAMP evasion, and their impact on killing of Ng in the absence of IFN-e. We will also determine if IFN-e reduces
the sensitivity of Ng to complement and/or CRAMP-mediated killing by regulating LOS sialyation.
The ability to modulate IFN responses during sexually-transmitted infections is a valid and potentially
transformative strategy to ameliorate or prevent the damaging sequelae of Ng infection and PID."

 In cochlear implant (CI) users, mechanisms underlying difficulties in understanding speech in complex
listening environments remain poorly understood, which hinders our capabilities of implementing precision
medicine in this patient population. In this study, we will take a bottom-up approach to identify neurophysiological
mechanisms underlying speech perception deficits in CI users. Our central hypothesis is that preservation of the
structural and functional integrity of the peripheral auditory system will result in improved clinical outcomes,
especially in challenging listening conditions. Surgical trauma of cochlear implantation and the foreign body
reaction to CI electrode array cause inflammatory response, which reduces the structural and functional integrity
of the peripheral auditory system. There are two newly developed strategies for minimizing surgical trauma and
immunological response to CI electrode: steroid-eluting electrode array and robotics-assisted electrode insertion.
To date, the functional benefits of using these two novel strategies in preserving the functional and structural
integrity of the peripheral auditory system in human CI users have not been established. To address this critical
need, Aim 1 and Aim 2 will determine the effect of steroid-eluting electrode arrays and robotic-assisted electrode
insertion on structural and functional integrity of the peripheral auditory system in human CI users, respectively.
Another factor which affects the structural and functional integrity of the peripheral auditory system is genetic
variation. To date, the effect of genetic variation on the ability of the peripheral auditory system to respond to
acoustic and electrical stimulation in human listeners remains poorly understood. To address this critical need,
Aim 3 will determine the effect of genetic variation on the ability of the CN to respond to acoustic and electrical
stimulation. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish 1) the benefits of
using steroid-eluting electrode array and robotics-assisted electrode insertion preserving structural and
functional integrity of the peripheral auditory system, and 2) the effects of genetic variation on the ability of the
peripheral auditory system to respond to acoustic and electrical stimulation in human CI users. Results of this
study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) serve as the scientific foundation for shifting the
current clinical practice for CI patients by including steroid-eluting electrode array or robotics-assisted electrode
insertion as part of standard clinical care, and 2) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based
clinical practice guidelines for managing CI patients based on genetic data."
10841415,"PROJECT 2: ABSTRACT
 Project 2 investigates auditory cognitive mechanisms that contribute to the variability in CI outcome based
on speech-in-noise (SiN) understanding. Understanding SiN is a complex task that requires multiple steps
including the abstraction of the target from crowded auditory scenes, auditory working memory, and attention.
Variation in any of these could affect SiN performance. However, most previous work focused on the status of
the peripheral auditory system, the effect of time and CI usage on adaptation to the new listening device, or
general cognitive and demographic factors. Project 2 aims to fill this gap in our understanding by assessing the
auditory cognitive mechanisms that are responsible for perceiving and attending to acoustic patterns over
frequency and time. These mechanisms operate at a level between the auditory periphery and high-level
language processing, so that Project 2 bridges a gap between Projects 1 and 3.
 First, we will carry out cross-sectional cognitive studies that assess auditory cognition over the timescales of
words and sentences. At the scale of words, in users of traditional CIs (fully electric hearing) we replicate our
initial work that demonstrates correlation between a measure of figure-ground (FG) detection and SiN
performance. We will also test whether adding measures of auditory cognition at the timescale of sentences
allows better prediction of detection of sentences in noise. In addition, for CI users that integrate acoustic and
electric hearing, we also test FG detection in the acoustic and electric frequency ranges and between these
ranges. We will calculate the correlation between these and SiN to assess the importance of grouping within
and across acoustic and electric aspects of hearing.
 Second, we will identify cortical bases for the auditory cognitive processes we identified in Aim 1 determine
SiN ability in CI users. We carry out cross-sectional neuroimaging EEG studies to ask if EEG responses
improve the prediction of SiN based on the cognitive measures of Aim 1. We will test a new EEG measure to
predict sentence-in-noise listening based on endogenous attention. Finally, a study using O-15 water PET will
test a model of SiN perception based on grouping mechanisms in left auditory cortex, and test whether these
occur in the same part of auditory cortex in CI users and normal controls.
 Third, we will examine acoustic+electric CI users longitudinally to test the hypothesis that cognitive and
brain mechanisms for grouping within the electric hearing ranges occur earlier after implantation than grouping
between the A and E ranges.
 Overall, this project will establish cognitive and brain mechanisms for auditory cognition over different
timescales and different frequency ranges that explain SiN detection in CI users. The cognitive measures and
EEG measures are realistic potential clinical tools for identifying non-auditory factors that are related to
outcomes in real world listening."
10860991,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential clinical diagnostic and research tool in neurology,
neurorehabilitation, cognitive, and behavioral neuroscience. However, in more than 100 years of EEG
research, the fundamental EEG technology has remained primitive and game-changing technological
innovations have been few and far between. Most current EEG systems rely on gelled silver/silver-
chloride or metal electrodes affixed on the scalp with conductive gels or pastes. These devices suffer
from the large size of the electrodes, cost, risk of corrosion, preparation, and cleaning. In addition,
gels and pastes are necessary to achieve adequate impedance and signal quality, but can be
irritating to the skin and dry out over time. Dry (i.e., gel-free) EEG systems can bypass some of the
issues of these wet EEG devices, but are still critically limited in terms of subject comfort and signal
quality. Finally, MRI-compatible EEG systems for multimodal brain mapping are often highly
specialized and expensive. Here, we propose to validate a fully novel, dry EEG system based on
MXene materials. MXenes offer high biocompatibility, stability, conductivity, flexibility and low
electrochemical impedance. In addition, they can be processed at a low cost, easily integrated into
functional neural devices with a variety of geometries and shapes, record brain electrical activity with
high fidelity without the need for gels or pastes, and interact weakly with magnetic fields. These
properties make MXene ideal to serve as enabling material for the next-generation EEG technologies.
In this proposal, we will build on promising pilot data to scale-up and optimize the fabrication and
design of MXene EEG electrodes. Specifically, we will aim to outperform the electrodes used in our
pilot studies while maintaining fast, cost-effective, and reliable fabrication. Then, we will validate the
performance of the best performing MXene electrodes on well-established behavioral tasks
associated with readily identifiable EEG spectral characteristics. Finally, we will examine the MRI
compatibility of a customized multichannel MXene EEG system for simultaneous EEG/MRI mapping
using quantitative and clinician ratings of signal quality, an essential step to propel its widespread
adoption in brain research and clinical contexts. By completing this project, we expect to move the
field forward by generating a novel dry EEG technology with superior resolution, signal fidelity, and
usability compared to current tools. These advantages could pave the way for fundamental
innovations in a number of domains including clinical neurology, rehabilitation, and cognitive
neuroscience."
10850701,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our long-term goal is to help develop a meaningful therapeutic and pre-symptomatic diagnostic
for Alzheimer’s disease because, while a disease-altering therapeutic is essential, it will not be
sufficient without a diagnostic that identifies disease before symptoms onset. We seek to
contribute to these long-term goals by helping identify specific molecular modifications, and
therefore specific mechanisms, driving disease using long-range optical DNA mapping and
sequencing technologies. Unfortunately, most Alzheimer’s disease genes are only implicated
through common non-functional variants, and it is still unclear how most Alzheimer’s disease
genes are involved in disease. Likewise, individual RNA isoforms in diseased brains for top
Alzheimer’s disease genes and their involvement in disease are poorly understood. Functional
variants and RNA sequencing at the isoform level in diseased brain tissue will provide specific
mechanisms to target for therapeutics and diagnostics. Large short-read sequencing efforts are
already ongoing to identify small functional variants involved in Alzheimer’s disease, but structural
DNA variants—many of which directly affect downstream RNA and proteins—also cause
neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that undiscovered SVs and aberrant RNA isoforms
play a direct role in Alzheimer’s disease. A thorough study in diseased brain using long-range
DNA and RNA technologies will complement current short-read efforts, providing important
disease insights."
10768770,"The Broad Institute’s DAP was created in 2003 and has an exceptional record of training members of groups
that are historically underrepresented (UR) in STEM, for research careers in genomics and biomedical science.
Broad’s training rests on the wealth of research demonstrating that UR students do not have deficits that must
be corrected. Instead, we recognize that our historic approach to scientific training and research drives out
members of minoritized groups from environments that are not created to support them. We build on
documented strategies that contribute to UR persistence in STEM, developing and implementing curriculum to
build trainees’ science identity and science self-efficacy and elevate outcome expectations. We will continue to
offer summer research experiences to undergraduates, and training to post-baccalaureate scholars, to support
their commitment and eventual success, in graduate studies. In these comprehensive programs we incorporate
mentored, cutting-edge genomics research, career preparation workshops and rigorous training in
communication skills to integrate trainees into the community and practice of research. In addition, our training
makes explicit the “unwritten curriculum” that trainees must acquire to navigate the frequently unspoken
standards and norms needed to succeed in research. By directly addressing aspects of socialization that
pertain to members of marginalized communities, the Broad’s DAP prepares trainees to persist in the face of
challenges that arise from aspects of their social identities that are not prevalent in most research
environments. The Broad’s multidisciplinary, highly collaborative environment and the support network that
includes myriad career trajectories, has proven to be a potent incubator of our trainees’ aspirations.
We are also committed to broadening access to genomics training. In collaboration with colleagues at Spelman
College we will organize, in Atlanta, the annual AUC-Broad Computational Genomics Workshop. The two-day
workshop will draw together faculty and trainees from Spelman College, Morehouse College, Morehouse
School of Medicine and Clark Atlanta University, which comprise the oldest association of historically Black
colleges and universities, for scientific presentations and hands-on training with tools, datasets and other
resources for research in genomics. Broad scientists will meet with AUCC researchers to discuss potential new
approaches and collaboration. The second day will be devoted to integration of genomics concepts into AUC
teaching, with input from Broad scientists and as facilitated by Spelman faculty who have trained for this role at
the National Academies Summer Institutes in Scientific Teaching. We will evaluate our program and its
outcomes, tracking the participants with respect to clear metrics. Our proposal builds on 17 years of success in
training UR scientists, as defined by persistence and advancement in science and research careers."
10842328,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in the world, with approximately 1.4 million new cases
and 700,000 deaths each year. Global incidence rates are expected to escalate 60% by 2030 as Western diets and
lifestyles become more common, and colorectal cancer is afflicting increasing numbers of young adults. Despite
preventative screening and surveillance, approximately 20% of colorectal cancer patients have metastatic disease at
the time of diagnosis, and 40-50% of early-stage patients will relapse after treatment. Unfortunately standard colorectal
cancer therapies such as anti-mitotic agents, epidermal growth factor receptor antagonists, and angiogenesis inhibitors
are largely ineffectual against late-stage disease. As a result, the 5-year survival rates for these patients is only 12%.
 It is now widely believed that eliminating cancer stem cells (CSCs) is the key to durable clinical responses, as
these self-renewing cells drive tumor relapse, chemoresistance, and metastasis. Our project strives to achieve this
goal by investigating and pharmacologically targeting metabolic pathways that are unique to colorectal cancer CSCs.
Our work builds on recent reports that aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) is expressed in intestinal stem cell
and required for the growth of colon cancer-derived spheroid cultures and xenografts. Our findings support a role for
ALDH1B1 in colorectal CSC maintenance, and we have developed the first known ALDH1B1-selective antagonists.
We have also solved the first X-ray crystal structures of ALDH1B1 and ALDH1B1-inhibitor complexes, uncovering the
molecular basis of antagonist action and gaining insights for further compound development. Our latest lead
compounds can inhibit the viability of colorectal cancer spheroids, with minimal effects on adherent cultures or non-
cancerous cells. In addition, our preliminary studies indicate that ALDH1B1 inhibitors can suppress the growth of colon
cancer xenografts in mice.
 We are now investigating the mechanisms by which ALDH1B1 promotes colorectal cancer (Aim 1). We will
explore the potential roles of this mitochondrial enzyme in colorectal CSC maintenance, chemoresistance, and
invasiveness, using cell lines that are representative of various colorectal cancer subtypes. We will also determine
whether oncogenic ALDH1B1 function involves the oxidation of retinal and/or lipid peroxidation products, and we will
elucidate the ALDH1B1-dependent transcriptome. In parallel with these mechanistic studies, we will use medicinal
chemistry, biochemical assays, and cellular models to develop ALDH1B1 inhibitors with optimized potency, selectivity,
and pharmacological properties (Aim 2). We will then evaluate the activities of ALDH1B1 inhibitors in colorectal cancer
xenograft models (Aim 3). Together, these investigations will deepen our understanding of ALDH1B1 function and
colorectal CSC biology. They will also generate new chemical tools for studying ALDH1B1-dependent pathways,
reveal the therapeutic potential of pharmacological ALDH1B1 inhibition, and provide valuable leads for the
development of ALDH1B1-targeting drugs."

A lack of diagnostics that rapidly and accurately identify bacterial pneumonia drives excessive empiric
antibiotic prescribing in patients with acute respiratory infections – 30-60% of these antibiotics are
unnecessary. Clinicians are under pressure to make rapid treatment decisions, usually without real-time
diagnostic information that reliably differentiates patients with bacterial pneumonia from other conditions
with similar clinical presentations. While time to effective treatment is a critical determinant of clinical
outcome, many patients with pneumonia receive inadequate empiric antibiotics due to rising rates of antibiotic
resistance in bacterial pneumonia pathogens. In contrast to bloodstream, gastrointestinal, or urinary tract
infections, the lung is a particularly challenging space to access without invasive diagnostic procedures. We
have established proof of concept in murine models that there are clear, bacterial species-specific breath
volatile metabolite signatures in pneumonia, and that microbial breath volatile metabolites have markedly
different responses to antibiotic exposure within a few hours in phenotypically susceptible vs. non-susceptible
organisms. In close collaboration with a team of engineering, biostatistical, antimicrobial resistance, and
regulatory experts, we will apply an advanced, portable, miniaturized gas chromatography-differential mobility
spectrometry (GC-DMS) diagnostic platform to the rapid, noninvasive, point-of care diagnosis of bacterial
pneumonia. We will derive breath volatile metabolite signatures that differentiate bacterial pneumonia from
other clinical syndromes with a similar clinical presentation, identify the underlying bacterial species directly
from metabolic fingerprints in the breath, and provide phenotypic information about antibiotic susceptibility,
harnessing early differential metabolic responses to effective vs. ineffective antibiotic therapy. This assay will
sharply reduce diagnostic delays in patients with pneumonia, both facilitating early administration of
appropriate antibiotics and curtailing unnecessary antibiotic use."

The study of mammalian immune cells and their interactions under native conditions is critical for understanding
the mechanisms initiating many diseases, including cancer, and for improving their treatments. Intravital
multiphoton microscopy (MPM), fluorescent reporter mouse models and in vivo cell and tissue labeling
techniques have made possible the investigation of immune cells interactions at a cellular/subcellular level in
their native environment. However, the significant differences in the skin and the immune system of mice and
humans preclude studies of uniquely human immune responses. The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the
ability of intravital MPM imaging to identify and distinguish immune cell populations in human skin, based on
label-free molecular contrast. We will utilize a fast, large area multiphoton exoscope (FLAME), an imaging
platform recently designed and developed by our group to have unique performance features optimized for
clinical skin imaging. FLAME has the ability to generate in vivo 3D images of human skin over macroscopic areas
(up to 8x8 mm2) with microscopic resolution (0.5-1µm) at fast acquisition rates (tens of seconds). FLAME features
label-free specificity for melanin and NADH based on their spectral and rapid time-resolved endogenous
fluorescence detection. Selective detection of melanin allows for imaging of pigment-rich cells such as
melanophages with high specificity, while time-resolved NADH fluorescence detection reports on the protein
binding activity of these molecules within the immune cells and on their metabolic heterogeneity. We have
demonstrated the ability of FLAME to detect resident immune cells in normal human skin as well as an activation
of a cellular immune response, based on endogenous molecular contrast. In this proposal, we will develop
methods for the in vivo characterization of the spatial and metabolic heterogeneity of immune cells in human
skin by using atopic dermatitis as an inflammatory skin condition model and Multi Omic Single-scan Assay with
Integrated Combinatorial Analysis (MOSAICA) for validation. We will also evaluate the feasibility of FLAME to
quantify changes in immune cell metabolism and spatiotemporal heterogeneity in response to immune activation.
If successfully validated in a larger clinical study, this approach would be a critical first step in making it possible
to characterize cellular-level immune responses in human skin at the bedside, with broad applications ranging
from detecting early immune reactions to developing improved cancer treatments."

Mental health disorders are common, chronic, and costly health conditions for individuals, families, and
communities. Treatment options are available, but treatment is underused with less than 50% of adults and
20% of children with mental health disorder receiving treatment each year. There are myriad reasons for not
receiving treatment. A potential barrier that has received limited research attention is the time required to
receive mental healthcare, which can be time consuming. Time constraints are likely salient for the employed,
who much schedule mental healthcare appointments – either for themselves or their dependents – around
work hours. The U.S. is one of three industrialized countries that does not have a federal policy that allow
employees to take paid time off to attend to healthcare needs of themselves and their families. As of July 2021,
14 states and 21 cities have adopted paid sick leave (PSL) mandates that confer on average 7 days of PSL
per year, mandated PSL can be used for mental healthcare. There is strong public support among Americans
for PSL, 84% support PSL, and states and localities continue to adopt PSL mandates.
The long-term objective of our proposed research is to assist in optimal design in public health policies that
allow employees and their families to receive valuable mental healthcare and improve mental health.
Specifically, the immediate objective of our application is to use rigorous quasi-experimental methods (e.g.,
difference-in-differences methods) and high quality, reproducible data (both insurance claims and survey data)
to estimate the causal effect of PSL mandates on i) access to PSL among employees with mental health
disorders, ii) use of mental healthcare among employees and their dependents (e.g., children and partners),
and (iii) indicators for potential quality of mental healthcare received. We will study the extent to which
community-level factors (mental healthcare workforce infrastructure, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status)
mediate the causal effect of PSL mandates on our outcomes. Our data sources are IBM Marketscan
commercial claims and the National Health Interview Survey. We will perform analyses separate for adults and
children, using variation from all state and city PSL mandates through 2022.
A rationale for our proposed research is that mental health disorders are leading causes of morbidity and
mortality in the U.S. and use of mental healthcare are below recommended levels and PSL mandates are
currently being adopted across the country, raising the importance of understanding how PSL can be used to
remove barriers to treatment. Our project is significant by providing new information on the benefits of
mandating PSL and potentially removing an under-studied, but empirically important, barrier to treatment: time."
10891374,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In the last decade, emerging evidence has unveiled that the innate immune system retains long-
term epigenetic and metabolic changes after infection or vaccination. This de facto innate immune memory
has been termed ‘trained immunity’ and is characterized by myeloid cells’ hyper-responsiveness following
a subsequent stimulus. Recent work has shown that sterile atherogenic/inflammatory triggers, such as
oxidized LDL or catecholamines, similarly induce a trained immunity phenotype through epigenetic and
metabolic reprogramming of the myeloid compartment. The long-term persistence of trained immunity in
vivo is due to the reprogramming of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in the bone marrow.
 We have recently reported that monocytes isolated from patients with risk factors for CVD, such as
familial hypercholesterolemia or pheochromocytoma, display a ‘trained’ phenotype. Importantly, in patients
with established coronary artery disease, we found HSPCs reprogrammed towards a pro-inflammatory
myeloid lineage. Project 2 will focus on stress-induced trained immunity’s mechanistic aspects in
cardiovascular disease patients and mouse models. Our central hypothesis is that chronic stress induces
trained immunity via HSPC reprogramming, which exacerbates the development of atherosclerosis and
worsens the outcome of cardiovascular events.
 In Aim 1, we will use deep phenotyping and imaging to study patients at high risk for cardiovascular
events in order to obtain an integrated view of stress-induced reprogramming of the myeloid cell
compartment. In Aim 2, we will study mice that were exposed to chronic mild psychosocial stress or to key
hormonal signals that promote peripheral effects on stress, followed by a rest period of 4 weeks. After the
rest period, stressed cohorts and non-stressed controls will undergo coronary artery ligation or induction of
atherosclerosis to test the hypothesis that preceding stress or exposure to stress hormones activates
trained immunity, thus increasing myelopoiesis and consequently worsening cardiovascular disease.
 Our unique ability to profile patients’ HSPCs at Radboudumc, the human models, and the mouse
models that mimic them will yield critical insights into the relationship between cardiovascular disease and
psychosocial stress."
10836436,"Background: Although the majority of national quality initiatives utilize electronic health record (EHR) or
administrative data, their ability to adequately discriminate performance has been brought into question and it
is unclear certain outcomes, such as postoperative complications, are accurately ascertained. By comparison,
clinical registry data, like the VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP), are widely considered
robust for performance evaluation and quality improvement (QI). But, VASQIP data collection is resource
intensive—data are manually abstracted by trained local Surgical Quality Nurses (SQNs) for a systematic
sample of surgical cases performed at all VA hospitals. VASQIP then uses the data to characterize the quality
and safety of surgical care at each hospital based on risk-adjusted 30-day morbidity and mortality rates.
Significance: VASQIP data collection practices present two important limitations. First, perioperative
outcome rates have significantly decreased the past two decades making it unclear whether systematic case
sampling is adequately powered to identify underperforming hospitals. Second, the time required for VASQIP
data collection detracts from SQNs’ ability to engage in other important job functions, like local QI activities.
Because SQNs spend substantial time working with VASQIP data, this represents an important missed
opportunity to identify a quality problem when it is evolving rather than when it has already occurred. As such,
alternative approaches that can provide reliable data and decrease the burden of data collection would have
tangible benefits for other national surgical and non-surgical QI initiatives within VA and the private sector.
Innovation: This project is novel because it can change the paradigm regarding the collection of QI data from
purely EHR or clinical registry to a more efficient hybrid model that could address reliability concerns
associated with the use of EHR (or administrative) data alone. It will also provide real-world, generalizable
data that can only be obtained within VA's data platform and can inform VA and the private sector national
surgical and non-surgical QI initiatives. We have two national operational partners: 1.) VA National Surgery
Office (NSO); 2.) Office of Reporting, Analytics, Performance, Improvement, and Deployment (RAPID).
Specific Aims: The overall goal is to address two important questions. First, given low perioperative
outcome rates across VA, is systematic sampling robust enough to inform surgical QI? Second, are hybrid data
(i.e.: EHR combined with clinical registry variables) a potentially reliable alternative for measuring VA
hospital surgical performance? These questions will be explored through the following specific aims: (1)
Evaluate whether analyzing all VASQIP-eligible surgical cases, relative to current systematic case sampling,
improves negative predictive value (i.e.: decreases false negative rates) for identifying VA hospitals with outlier
performance; (2) Compare the use of hybrid EHR and clinical registry data, relative to clinical registry alone,
for evaluating risk-adjusted surgical performance at VA hospitals; (3) Explore how more efficient VASQIP data
collection could enhance local QI efforts through in-depth, key informant interviews with SQNs.
Methodology: This mixed-methods proposal will involve hospital-level, observational studies using VASQIP
and Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) data from patients who underwent non-cardiac surgery (2016-2019) as
well as qualitative interviews with SQNs. With comparative effectiveness in mind, these data will be used to
explore what would be observed if data from all surgical cases were included in VASQIP and to understand
whether other existing VA data sources might improve VASQIP data collection efficiency and enhance local QI.
Next Steps: With the NSO, we will prospectively compare the fidelity of hand-abstracted variables to
automatable variables from CDW. The implementation plan (supported by the VA National Director of
Surgery) will utilize VASQIP’s existing infrastructure by partnering with VINCI to provide the NSO with
centralized CDW access (using RAPID’s data access model as a template) allowing automated data collection."

The cornea is among the few tissues that enjoy immune privilege, however, corneal immune privilege is
not absolute. In many corneal diseases, including infectious keratitis, dry eye disease, and corneal
injuries, infiltrating leukocytes can advance disease progression. Our preliminary results suggest that
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), which reside in the cornea during steady state, actively participate
in the maintenance of corneal immune homeostasis, as their depletion leads to enhanced corneal
leukocyte infiltration and amplified adaptive immune responses in draining lymph nodes (dLNs). Thus, in
this application, we propose to evaluate the significance of PDCs in the maintenance of tolerance and
the mechanisms through which PDCs contribute to corneal immune homeostasis. We will identify
potential candidates through single cell sequencing of PDCs. We aim to study the role of PDCs in
mediating multiple steps involved in the process of inflammation, from leukocyte recruitment to the
cornea, antigen uptake and processing by antigen presenting cells, their egress to, and antigen
presentation in dLNs, and priming of T cells. Additionally, we have observed that PDCs interact directly
with T cells in the dLNs, and support development and stabilization of regulatory T cell (Tregs),
important immunosuppressive lymphocytes. We aim to analyze the molecular mechanisms by which
PDCs induce and maintain Tregs, as well as examine the clinical utility of adoptive transfer of PDC-
induced Tregs in infectious keratitis, dry eye disease and corneal transplantation. We also propose to
study the feasibility, efficacy, and potential local and systemic side effects of local adoptive transfer of
PDCs to the cornea for the treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases. Next, we aim to evaluate
therapeutic efficacy of local adoptive transfer of PDCs or application of PDC secretome in limiting clinical
severity of the disease, infiltration of leukocytes, disease progression, and complications in models of
dry eye disease and herpes simplex keratitis. This application proposes a paradigm shift on how PDCs
modulate immunity, and could result in the introduction of new immunomodulatory therapeutic
avenues for ocular as well as systemic inflammatory, autoimmune, alloimmune and infectious diseases."

Understanding the role of the pharmaceutical industry in propelling the current opioid crisis in the U.S. is an
essential strategy for preventing future epidemics. Using multiple forms of textual data and innovative
methodologies for data mining and triangulation, this project examines the specific impacts of industry efforts to
target military veterans as opioid consumers and analyzes how new industry-driven narratives, or scripts,
about opioid analgesics were circulated. Veterans have many vulnerabilities and are one of the populations
most severely impacted by the opioid crisis and opioid-related harms, including overdose and HIV/HCV
infection. Important documents emerging in litigation against pharmaceutical companies establish that
veterans were targeted as an important consumer niche through advocacy groups and paid accounts from
veterans about the benefits of opioid therapies. However, only a small portion of the documents currently being
revealed in the process of legal discovery have been examined by public health researchers, and very little is
currently known about broader industry agendas and the processes by which pro-pharma narratives became
part of veteran-specific health discourse, driving attitudes toward opioids and raising barriers to non-opioid pain
management. To identify the themes and elucidate the processes by which these scripts were internalized by
different veteran populations, this mixed-method research will triangulate large datasets of pharmaceutical
industry marketing and legal documentation with veteran-themed publications and the lived experience of
chronic pain patients. Findings will be translated into deliverables which positively impact pain management
policy, practice, and the attitudes and expectations of veterans with chronic pain. The scientific team includes
veterans and scientists at the forefront of uncovering how the tobacco industry targeted military personnel and
veterans, along with experts on opioid use and pharmaceutical industry litigation. The systematic textual and
content analyses in this study represent a critical case study in pharmaceutical industry efforts to change
prescribing policy and popular culture and will serve as an important contribution to literature on the natural
history of drug crises and to clinical approaches to pain by achieving the following aims:
Aim 1: Use textual mining technology and analytic methods refined by tobacco researchers to explicate the
pharmaceutical industry's campaign to influence veterans' (and veterans service organizations') perceptions
opioid therapies, particularly within the context of chronic pain management.
Aim 2: Conduct qualitative interviews among veterans with histories of pain and opioid use to understand
sociocultural meanings and cognitive scripts that impede safe, effective, and medically-appropriate care.
Aim 3: Based on a synthesis of data from Aims 1 and 2, conduct T0 and T1 translational research to generate
concrete best practices, tools, and web resources to guide clinical and prescriber engagement with veteran
and other chronic pain populations."
10846592,"The mitochondrial inner membrane is the site of essential cellular functions such as oxidative
phosphorylation, phospholipid metabolism, and the regulation of apoptosis. These activities are
performed by a composite mitochondrial proteome that requires constant resculpting to respond
to both the changing metabolic demands of the cell and the emergence of damage driven by
reactive oxygen species. This resculpting is performed by two mitochondrial AAA+ proteases,
which harness the energy of ATP to recognize, unfold and degrade protein substrates both from
within and surrounding the inner membrane. In humans, dysfunction of these proteases has been
linked to the development of severe neurodegenerative disorders such as spinocerebellar ataxia.
AAA+ proteases assemble as hexamers to form an internal proteolytic chamber into which
substrates are forcibly translocated by a ring of ATPases. The study of the mitochondrial AAA+
proteases has been long hampered by their combination of multiple soluble catalytic domains with
insoluble transmembrane domains for anchoring into the inner membrane. We utilize a protein-
engineering approach to assemble previously membrane-constrained hexameric proteases in a
soluble, active form. Our goal is to use these rebuilt proteases to perform a rigorous analysis of
the mechanisms driving energy-dependent proteolysis at the mitochondrial inner membrane. The
first aim of the proposal is to define how substrates are selected for degradation among the myriad
mitochondrial proteins. Degradation signal sequences will be identified from physiological
substrates to ask whether these signals are conserved across diverse mitochondrial proteins to
enable recognition by common proteases. The second aim is to examine the recognition complex
formed between these proteases and specific substrates. A series of complementary biochemical
approaches will map the protease substrate binding sites and identify the complementary contacts
used to promote selection and degradation. Finally, we will examine how the architecture of the
proteolytic sites within the degradation chamber achieves specificity of peptide-bond cleavage
specificity, resulting in site-specific cleavage of a class of substrates, including the regulator of
mitochondrial fission. Together, these experiments will provide a rigorous mechanistic analysis of
the mitochondrial AAA+ proteases and provide foundational knowledge to aid the development
of small molecule modulators as future therapeutics."

Acute respiratory failure (ARF) requiring invasive ventilation occurs in one-third of intensive care unit (ICU)
patients and is associated with a high risk of death. Ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) is a modifiable
determinant of ARF outcomes that develops when the at-risk lung experiences excessive global or regional
stress/strain. VILI may result from excessive forces applied by the ventilator and/or respiratory muscles.
Optimizing ventilator titration has been studied extensively, while far less is known about the contribution of
spontaneous breathing effort to VILI in ARF. High respiratory drive can cause injuriously high tidal volumes,
increasing global stress/strain either with synchronous effort or breath stacking dyssynchrony depending on
ventilator mode. High drive also causes temporally heterogeneous insufflation, increasing intra-tidal regional
strain for a given tidal volume. Both patterns of respiratory drive-related increase in stress/strain worsen lung
injury in preclinical models and have been observed in patients with ARF, but whether they contribute clinically
meaningful lung injury in patients is unclear. Extremes of drive, high or low, also may cause clinically relevant
diaphragm injury. High drive risks load-induced injury, particularly in flow-limited ventilator modes or certain
patient-ventilator dyssynchronies in which inspiratory support ends prematurely relative to patient effort. Low
drive risks diaphragm disuse atrophy, proven to occur in some patients within a few days on the ventilator.
Causes of drive heterogeneity in ARF are not well established. Chemoreceptor, mechanoreceptor, and cortical
inputs (e.g. pain, anxiety) are well established modulators of respiratory drive, but they alone do not fully
explain drive heterogeneity in ARF. Although deep sedation often suppresses respiratory drive in healthy
individuals, we recently found that sedation depth and respiratory drive are not well correlated in ARF. Many
patients exhibit high drive refractory to deep sedation, while in others even light sedation can completely
eliminate drive. Our preliminary data suggest differences in systemic inflammation might explain this drive
heterogeneity. This research will deepen understanding of mechanisms underlying drive heterogeneity and its
relationship with clinical outcomes in patients with ARF. Our overall hypothesis is that systemic inflammation is
a key determinant of respiratory drive, extremes of which cause clinically important lung and diaphragm injury.
We will assemble a prospective two-hospital, multi-ICU cohort in whom respiratory mechanics and serum
biomarkers are ascertained serially. Aim 1 evaluates circulating inflammatory markers as a potential contributor
to drive heterogeneity. Aim 2 determines mechanisms by which extremes of respiratory drive may contribute to
lung and diaphragm injury. Aim 3 evaluates the relationship between respiratory drive and time to extubation.
Findings from this work will inform development of a precision ventilation strategy, incorporating respiratory
drive to optimize lung and diaphragm protection, for evaluation in a future clinical trial."

Type one diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a debilitating disease with no cure. After an initial partial remission with
improved residual β-cell function, the “honeymoon period”, less than 17% of children achieve the glycemic
targets recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), placing millions at risk for complications
and early mortality. Conversely, tight glycemic control - as achieved with greater insulin doses to match
carbohydrates consumed - has also been linked to complications, namely weight-gain, insulin resistance, and
metabolic syndrome. Preliminary evidence suggests that a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat, (i.e., ketogenic diet,
KD) in T1D may (1) improve glycemic control by mitigating postprandial glycemic excursions and (2) reduce
insulin exposure and associated adverse effects on peripheral tissues. Children with incident T1D may
experience additional benefits, as a KD may also (3) prolong the honeymoon period - as seen in case reports -
via immune and/or metabolic effects on β-cell function. Specifically, improved glycemia and insulinemia may
promote β-cell rest, and the physiologically elevated β-hydroxybutyrate (βOHB) levels on a KD have been linked
to decreased inflammation and gut microbiome changes that may reduce ß-cell autoimmunity.
We propose to test the hypothesis that a KD vs. standard diet (SD) will prolong diabetes remission and improve
diabetes control in children with incident T1D. In a 9-months parallel randomized controlled trial (RCT), fifty-two
children (26 per arm) aged 5-12 years will receive a family-based intervention with food deliveries and intensive
nutrition and diabetes education to promote a KD vs SD. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and Bluetooth
enabled insulin pens will be used for cloud-based data collection. Anthropometrics, fasting biomarkers and
stimulated C-peptide area under the curve following a mixed meal tolerance test will will be assessed at baseline,
1, 5 and 9 months. The primary endpoint will be percent change in stimulated C-peptide between 1 and 9 months.
Secondary endpoints will include percent children with clinical diabetes remission (insulin dose adjusted HbA1c
[IADD1c] <9) at 9 months, indices of glycemic control from continuous glucose monitoring, and markers of
metabolic health (BMI, indices of insulin resistance, and the ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol). To explore
pathways related to improved ß-cell function, we will also evaluate gut microbiome, metabolome, and
immunologic biomarker responses to a KD vs SD and test interactions of targeted biomarker groups with
changes in β-cell function and glycemia.
Compared with technological and pharmacological treatments, dietary intervention is inexpensive, relatively free
of major side-effects and directly translatable. A KD may have benefits on ß-cell function, glycemia and
insulinemia, and would thereby provide a major therapeutic advance for children living with T1D. Regardless of
outcome, our research will close an important knowledge gap on the safety and efficacy of a KD for children with
T1D, an approach with increasing patient popularity despite lack of high-quality research."

The endothelium responds to a multitude of chemical and mechanical factors in regulating vascular tone,
angiogenesis, blood pressure and blood flow. The endothelial volume regulatory anion channel (VRAC) has
been proposed to be mechano-sensitive, to activate in response to fluid flow/hydrostatic pressure and putatively
regulate vascular reactivity and angiogenesis. We recently reported that the Leucine Rich Repeat Containing
Protein 8a, LRRC8a (LRRC8A) is a required component of the heterohexameric complex that forms VRAC in
human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). Endothelial LRRC8A regulates AKT-eNOS and mTOR signaling under
basal conditions, and with stretch and shear-flow stimulation and is required for EC alignment to laminar shear
flow. Endothelium-restricted LRRC8A KO (LRRC8A KO) mice have impaired endothelium-dependent vascular
relaxation, develop hypertension in response to chronic angiotensin II infusion and exhibit impaired retinal blood
flow with both diffuse and focal blood vessel narrowing in the setting of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). These data
demonstrate that LRRC8a regulates AKT-eNOS, and mTOR signaling in endothelium and is required for
maintaining vascular function. There remains a knowledge gap in (a) the molecular identity of specific
LRRC8 heteromers that form VRAC in endothelium, (b) the molecular mechanisms that connect the
endothelial LRRC8 complex to AKT-eNOS and mTOR signaling, (c) the therapeutic potential of small
molecules targeting the LRRC8 complex needs to be evaluated, leading to a novel class of compounds
to improve vascular function and hypertension in metabolic syndrome.
We have biochemical, patch-clamp and imaging evidence that LRRC8 channel complexes are expressed and
functional in lysosomes (Lyso-LRRC8) and have identified a critical channel pore mutation (R103E) that
specifically disrupts LRRC8 channel activity. Given that lysosomes are signaling hubs that integrate nutrient
sensing and AKT-mTOR signaling, we hypothesize LRRC8A/C channels co-regulate plasma membrane
PI3K-AKT signaling and lysosome centered mTOR signaling in endothelium, and that small molecule
LRRC8 complex modulators can restore dysfunctional endothelial LRRC8A/C in diabetes associated
vascular disease and hypertension. To test the above hypotheses, we propose three specific AIMs that
develop endothelial LRRC8 biology from molecular signaling mechanisms to proof of concept in vivo therapeutic:
AIM#1: Delineate the mechanisms of plasma membrane versus lysosomal LRRC8 signaling to AKT-
mTOR signaling in endothelium.
AIM#2: Examine LRRC8 molecular contributions to EC function in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo
AIM#3: Examine the therapeutic efficacy of small molecule LRRC8 modulators to improve vascular
function and blood pressure in diabetes associated hypertension models"
10791854,"As animals navigate their environments, their nervous systems transition between a wide range of
internal states that influence how sensory information is processed and how behaviors are generated. These
states of arousal, motivation, and mood typically persist for long durations of time, from minutes to hours, and
exert widespread effects across multiple sensory modalities and motor systems. Although most animals organize
their behavioral outputs in this state-like fashion, the neural mechanisms that underlie the generation of these
states are poorly understood. One prevailing hypothesis to explain how internal states are generated
suggests that fast timescale neural dynamics, which underlie moment-by-moment behavioral changes, might
be controlled over slower timescales by ascending pathways, most notably the neuromodulatory systems.
Indeed, small, defined subsets of neuromodulator-producing neurons can elicit internal state transitions in
many animals. Moreover, recent population-level recordings of neural activity have revealed that internal
states are accompanied by widespread, distributed changes in activity across many brain regions.
Remarkably, recent work has also shown that granular, moment-by-moment motor actions are reflected in
neural activity across many brain regions. This gives rise to a view that sensory signals, granular behavioral
signals, and internal state signals all co-occur in most brain circuits. However, how population-level activity
encodes a diverse set of behavioral parameters and how this encoding is influenced by internal states to
give rise to state-dependent behavioral changes is unknown. Here, we propose to tackle this problem in the
nematode C. elegans, whose crystalline nervous system, well-defined set of motor programs, and genetic
tractability should make it possible to build complete models of how neural activity encodes behavior across
distinct states. This proposal builds off new preliminary data. First, we developed a new recording platform
that enables brain-wide calcium imaging of freely-moving C. elegans with simultaneous quantification of the
diverse motor programs of the animal. We also built computational models that relate neural activity to
behavior with a high degree of precision. Surprisingly, this reveals that many C. elegans neurons encode
multiple ongoing motor programs and these encodings flexibly change over time. Moreover, we have
developed two behavioral paradigms in which we can elicit robust, stereotyped aversive internal states that
unfold over either minutes-long (Aim 1) or hours-long (Aim 2) timescales. We now propose to decipher how
each neuron across the C. elegans brain encodes precise behavioral features, creating an atlas of how
behaviors are encoded across the nervous system. We will then determine how minutes- or hours-long
internal states modulate neural activity across the brain. The comprehensive datasets that we will generate,
along with the computational models that we will build, will give rise to a clear understanding of internal state
structure in this animal and reveal basic principles that should guide future research in many animal models."

10840934,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core B
One of the goals of this U19 Biomimetics Cooperative Research Center (BCRC) application is to use state-of-
the-art platforms to address gaps in knowledge surrounding pathogenesis of viral and bacterial organisms at
mucosal surfaces. To meet this goal, the establishment of the Human Biomimetic Scientific Core (HBSC) will
allow the provision of critical biologically relevant human biomimetic organoid platforms that are essential for the
success of the project. The core will be organized around two goals: (1) generate, maintain, and provide
experimentally ready intestinal and airway organoid cultures and specialized growth reagents for use in the
projects proposed in this application, and (2) increase the complexity of organoid cultures by the integration of
neuronal, immune, and microbiome components to improve the organoids as 3D mimetic models. These goals
will facilitate infectious disease research in the airway and intestine. The core will reduce labor, supply and
equipment costs, and time required to complete projects by centralizing the isolation, growth, and maintenance
of the organoid lines and devote time and resources to increasing the complexity of the cultures. Bulk acquisition
of materials, standardization of media and other reagents, and centralization of the maintenance of the lines
results in significant time and cost savings to the individual project investigators and ensures standardization
and reproducibility. The HBSC will provide training and advice to each of the project personnel and develop a
close interactive relationship with the principle investigators that will allow optimization and customization of core
reagents for use in the projects. The BCRC core will be an essential component of the success of each of the
projects in this application as well as a unifying element in connecting them together."
10840938,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Core C
New pre-clinical models of both the airway and gastrointestinal epithelium, especially those that adequately
reflect relevant human 3D physiology and disease pathophysiology, are desperately needed to elucidate disease
mechanisms and identify avenues for treatment. The overall objective of the Engineering MicroEnvironment
Core (EMEC) is to provide the group of Biomimetic Collaborative Research Center (BCRC) investigators with
biomaterial and fluidic chamber platforms and additional enabling technologies to improve human
gastrointestinal and lung systems for the studies proposed in Projects 1-3 and the Human Biomimetic Scientific
Core (HBSC, Core B). These biomimetic systems are designed to replicate key aspects of the epithelial cells’
3D physiological and physical environment. These platforms will utilize the biomaterial and tissue engineering
technologies that we established during our original NAMSED funding, and will also build upon these
technologies to expand our capabilities to answer questions about the role of the host mucus layer, cell physical
microenvironment, and cell communities in intestinal and lung infections. The service component of the EMEC
will be to provide engineering tools, including (1) preparing “TransWell Trough” systems to apply flow to co-
cultures of anatomically-distinct epithelial cells, (2) fabricating tissue engineering/biomaterial platforms to support
intestinal or lung epithelial cell cultures, (3) fabricating millifluidic perfusion chambers (mPC) for flow across
intestinal epithelial cells ± pathogens, (4) fabricating and maintaining calibrated stocks of oxygen-sensing
hydrogel-based microparticles, (5) 3D printing of molds and other components of the culture systems being
fabricated, (6) quantifying tissue and biofluid mechanical behavior to prepare in vitro models with physiologically
faithful material properties, (7) computational modeling of fluid dynamics and oxygen transport in culture
systems, and (8) transferring technology through training group members and personnel at other funded U19s.
The development component of EMEC will enhance the previously tested culture systems to mimic the
complexity of the 3D host environment in the proposed studies, through (1) developing a modification of the
TransWell Trough model with dual flow, (2) modifying the hydrogels to enable 3D encapsulation of immune and
neural cells for co-culture studies, (3) developing a modified mPC system to grow the epithelial cells atop a
biomimetic hydrogel surface, and (4) developing customized mucosal mimics to facilitate screening of host
mucus-pathogen interactions. Providing these platforms, tools, and services through a central core will save
time, effort, and costs, accelerate the rate of discovery, and enable comparison of results across Projects
whenever possible. The EMEC will be consultative and responsive to needs of the individual Projects, which
may change as the research proceeds and as the overall field evolves. New activities will be developed to meet
the needs of the Project investigators. Our goal is complementary and collaborative in these efforts to develop
biomimetic engineering models to study the role of the host mucosal surface in enteric and respiratory infections."
10840944,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gastroenteritis (GE) is among the leading causes of mortality globally. Our research focuses on human rotavirus
(HRV) and human norovirus (HuNoV), the two leading causes of viral GE worldwide causing over 320,000
deaths annually. No antivirals are available for either virus and there is no vaccine for HuNoVs. While vaccines
to HRV are available and are effective in high-income countries (84-90%), the efficacy remains suboptimal (45-
57%) in low-income settings where the burden of disease is greatest. Economically, HuNoV infections result in
over $4 billion in direct healthcare costs and over $60 billion in societal costs each year. These data underscore
the need for continued investment in studies to overcome mucosal enteric disease.
Both these human GI viruses do not infect mice; further, HRV replicates poorly in cultured cells, and HuNoV was
noncultivatable for over almost 50 years. Using tissue stem cell-derived human intestinal organoid (HIO) cultures
as a replication model for these human GI pathogens, we made some remarkable fundamental discoveries. Key
findings include: both human viruses replicate in at least two distinct intestinal cell types (enterocytes and
enterendocrine cells) in the small intestine, and HRVs also replicate in the colon. Each virus binds to genetically
encoded histo-blood antigens (HBGAs) but these glycans play different roles in infection. HBGA expression does
not restrict infection but correlates with severe HRV disease while it is required for infection with HuNoV.
Interactions with HBGA are strain-dependent for both viruses. Each virus infects the polarized epithelium by a
different route with HRVs infecting basolaterally and HuNoVs infecting apically. Infected HIO cultures produce a
new form of HRV released in vesicles that exhibit different properties from standard cell-culture derived virus.
Both viruses induce a predominant epithelial innate response of type III interferon (IFN); surprisingly this does
not restrict virus replication suggesting type III IFN may have other functions than being antiviral. HIOs allow
cultivation of multiple HuNoV strains and bile is a critical factor for replication.
Although these previous studies using epithelial-only HIOs provide new knowledge on HRV and HuNoV
infections, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology and host responses that lead to
life-threatening disease. Continued development of “human mini-gut” models is required to fully understand
human-GI virus interactions linked to pathogenesis and improve mucosal immune responses to viral infections.
Using complex biomimetic cultures, we propose to answer two biological questions of fundamental and clinical
relevance: What mechanisms mediate severe GI disease during infection with HRV and HuNoV (Aim 1), and
what is the role of microbe-microbe interactions in the pathophysiology of viral GE (Aim 2)? Through interactions
with Projects 2 and 3 and our two Scientific Cores, we predict our studies will advance and enable human
organ biomimetics as translational models to understand human mucosal infections and to serve as a bridge
between preclinical animal models and first-in-human clinical trials."
10840950,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 2
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major global respiratory pathogen. The Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented crisis. Respiratory virus
infections are often accompanied by gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, but how respiratory pathogens cause GI
disease is not understood. Moreover, a number of vaccines and therapeutics are being developed against these
important pathogens, however, the existing models do not recapitulate the human experience. Small animal and
non-human primate models fall short of mimicking human disease, and the human RSV challenge model is
expensive and raises safety concerns. The requirement for BSL-3 facilities to study SARS-CoV-2 hampers data
generation and increases cost. The human endemic CoV-NL63 can serve as a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 because
it uses the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This project will develop an ex-vivo Human
Challenge Airway Model by advancing our current 3-dimensional (3D) nose/lung model for studies on
RSV and CoV-NL63 (proxy for SARS-CoV-2) to address the urgent need for a preclinical model that
recapitulates the human disease. In collaboration with the Human Biomimetic Scientific Core, we have
developed the expertise for isolating stems cells and generating 3D nose and lung organoid lines from nasal
wash and bronchoalveolar fluids, respectively. Our internationally recognized expertise in RSV and other
respiratory viruses uniquely positions us to develop advanced 3D nose/lung models for dissecting the
pathogenesis of RSV (Aim 1), and develop airway and GI platforms with the Engineering Micro-Environment
Core (EMEC) to evaluate molecular mechanisms driving the lung-gut axis of respiratory virus disease (Aim 2).
We will select donors based on sex and age so that we can comprehensively study the complex interactions of
host (age, sex, distinct airway sites, and immune cells) and virus, and the contribution of humoral and cellular
immune responses in an HLA-restricted system. We will also evaluate the lung-gut axis by studying the
downstream effects of RSV and CoV-NL63 airway infection on the GI tract by either direct (infection) or indirect
(inflammation) pathways using lung-gut flow systems. This project is responsive to the RFA by the development
of an advanced nose/lung model with increased complexity that includes humoral and cellular immunity, as well
as defining novel mechanistic pathways in the lung-gut axis of respiratory virus disease. The global scientific
community will benefit immensely from a 3-D nose/lung airway-virus model that recapitulates human virus
infection and serves as a platform to evaluate therapeutics and vaccines."
10840955,"Project Summary – Project 3
The intestinal mucosal surface is a complex mechano-physiologic environment comprised of pathogen,
commensal, and host. Because this complexity may affect our understanding of the etiology of disease, it is
critical to develop model systems that accurately capture their physiology. Human intestinal organoids (HIOs)
have been proposed as a mucosal biomimetic to study infectious diseases caused by enteric pathogens. Our
previously funded project (part of the NIAID U19 NAMSED initiative) established the use of HIOs to understand
the pathogenesis of Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), a common cause of persistent diarrhea in children, the
immunocompromised, and travelers. There is no vaccine for EAEC and antibiotic treatment is complicated by
multi-drug resistance, the ablation of protective commensals, and reported ineffectiveness at reducing diarrheal
duration. A seminal finding from our study was the unexpected observation that the susceptibility to EAEC
infection was substantially dependent on the host donor, especially in the context of new data that suggests the
mucosal receptor for EAEC is heparan-sulfated proteoglycan (HSPG). The work in this renewal builds upon this
observation by now hypothesizing that EAEC donor-specific adherence drives the local delivery of secreted
cytopathic effectors to the intestinal epithelium. In Aim 1, a large collection of HIOs are characterized for their
sensitivity to EAEC infection and hallmark signatures of molecular pathogenesis correlated to the status of donor
HSPGs. In Aim 2, key intestinal mechano-physiologic properties, including luminal flow, basolateral stiffness, the
presence of immune cells, and segmental connectivity, are assessed for their effect on HSPG-dependent EAEC
infection. Finally, human intestinal microbiota (commensals and phage) that antagonize EAEC by competing for
a glycan-based intestinal niche will be identified. This work will reveal the host factors that govern EAEC
susceptibility to infection, the mechano-physiologic cues that drive them, and targeted biota-based approaches
that are antagonistic and therapeutic."
10885063,"Abstract
The threats to chemical warfare-associated agents, including arsenicals and nitrogen mustards are increasing
exceedingly, and no direct antidote is currently available to mitigate the deleterious cutaneous and systemic
responses to prevent mortality. Though the associated cytotoxic effects of most of these agents are mediated
due to their ability to act as alkylating agents, a significant knowledge gap exits in the understanding of detailed
molecular mechanisms of how these vesicants cause cutaneous and systemic toxic effects, and thus, the
development of antidotes. The current proposal is built upon the scientific premise that exposure to various pro-
oxidative stressors, including alkylating chemotherapeutic agents, and thermal burn injuries (TBI) when coupled
with ethanol (ETOH) produce the potent bioactive lipid mediator, Platelet-activating factor (PAF) by both
enzymatically and non-enzymatically via reactive oxygen species (ROS). Studies, including ours, have shown
that these PAF agonists induce local inflammation, as well as multi-system organ dysfunction (MOD).
Importantly, recent studies have indicated that small membrane-bound vesicles known as microvesicle particles
(MVP), generated via acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) enzyme, are released from cells in response to various
stressors. These MVP can act as potent signaling agents due to their ability to carry nuclear and cytoplasmic
components. More importantly, the current proposal is built upon our discovery that chemotherapeutic agents,
and TBI+ETOH via their ability to damage keratinocytes, generate PAF agonists which travel via MVP to induce
the local (cutaneous) and systemic responses. Using antioxidants and PAFR-expressing/null cell lines and
pharmacologic/genetic inhibition of aSMase enzyme, our studies have implicated the involvement of the PAFR
signaling in aSMase activation resulting in PAF-laden MVP release. Based upon these compelling evidences,
we hypothesize that chemical warfare-associated agents via their ability to generate ROS, produce PAF agonists
and MVP from human and murine keratinocytes in a PAFR-aSMase-dependent manner, which mediate the
cutaneous cytotoxic as well as systemic MOD effects. Two aims are proposed to test our hypothesis. Aim 1 will
use validated in vitro and ex vivo models and pharmacologic agents to determine the roles of the PAFR,
downstream signaling pathways, and aSMase enzyme in chemical warfare-associated agents-induce PAF
agonists and MVP generation. Agents to be tested are nitrogen/sulfur mustards and an arsenical. Aim 2 will use
PAFR/aSMase-expressing and deficient mouse models, as well as pharmacological inhibitors of PAFR and
aSMase to determine the role of PAF-laden MVP generation in the local and systemic responses by topical
nitrogen mustargen exposure. Successful completion of this project will (i) fill important mechanistic gaps in and
validate novel tools to allow the modulation of PAF-laden MVP generation to mitigate chemical warfare-
associated agents’ effects; and ii) address functional roles of PAFR-aSMase in nitrogen mustard-induced local
and systemic MOD effects, to provide novel treatment approaches."
10835956,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The outcomes of Black patients are worse than white patients across renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes. Black
patients also suffer higher disease incidence compared to the white patient population, particularly for the
papillary subtype. Environmental and structural factors likely contribute to this disparity; however, there is
evidence suggesting that somatic genomic differences also contribute. Although patients of African (AFR)
ancestry are under-represented in most publicly available databases, decreased VHL gene mutation and
chromosome 3p deletion in clear cell RCC patients of AFR ancestry was observed compared to European (EUR)
ancestry. In our preliminary data with increased sample size, we found NF2 mutations and chromosome 22q
deletion to be more frequent in RCCs from patients of AFR ancestry across subtypes. These preliminary findings
of genomic correlations with ancestry lead us to hypothesize that the survival disparity may be partially explained
by molecular features enriched in tumors from patients of AFR ancestry.
In this project, we will take three parallel approaches to understanding the molecular tumor differences between
patients of AFR and EUR ancestry. In the first aim, we will perform a comprehensive computational analysis of
larger RCC datasets to validate and identify new genomic tumor differences between these two patient
populations. In the second aim, we will functionally characterize the “ancestry-specific” genomic alterations
identified in preliminary studies, including two aneuploidy events - chromosome 3p deletion and chromosome
22q deletion. Lastly, in the third aim, we will move beyond panel and exome sequencing to identify new driver
events, using whole-genome sequencing coupled with RNA-sequencing on tumors from Black patients. The
results from these experiments will lead to new insights about the specific biology of RCC in this patient
population. Our studies will reveal ancestry-associated driver alterations that could not only improve diagnostic
testing for RCC patients of AFR ancestry, but will also identify new therapeutic targets to decrease the disparities
observed in RCC."
10872266,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this R34 proposal and the future R61/R33-funded RCT is to decrease the severity of moderate and
severe acute asthma exacerbations in children, sufficiently and quickly enough to decrease hospitalizations.
These hospitalizations disproportionately affect Black and low-income children. They often occur because leu-
kotriene (LT) induced airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction are incompletely responsive to systemic
corticosteroid (CCS) and inhaled albuterol. LT synthesis is induced by viral respiratory infections and aeroaller-
gens, the most common exacerbation triggers in children. We have a critical clinical need for a medication that
will rapidly decrease LT-mediated airway inflammation and bronchoconstriction. Montelukast (MK), a potent
LT-receptor antagonist, may address this need. IV MK caused rapid, sustained improvement at peak plasma
levels (Cmax) of ≈1,700 ng/ml in adults with moderate and severe exacerbations. IV MK is not available, and
our preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) study in children with exacerbations found that high-dose oral MK (mean
1.0 mg/kg) achieves Cmax of 1,700 ng/ml in 40% of participants. The R34 Aim is to perform an adaptive, PK-
guided, double-masked RCT of standard treatment plus high-dose oral MK or identical placebo, with 3 escalat-
ing mg/kg MK dose-levels determined by PK-guided dose modeling, in children with exacerbations that are
moderate or severe after initial treatment with albuterol. We will test three Hypotheses (1) High-dose oral
montelukast achieves Cmax >1,700 ng/ml in >86% of at least one of three sequential participant groups with
escalating weight-based (mg/kg) doses between groups; (2) Participants randomized to high-dose oral monte-
lukast have a 2 point or greater improvement of the validated Acute Asthma Intensity Research Score (AAIRS)
4 hours post-treatment in comparison with control group participants; and (3) Among montelukast recipients,
Cmax correlates with change of the AAIRS at 4 hours. This R34 research will yield essential and sufficient
knowledge to make definitive design decisions for a Phase II RCT (R61-R33 funded), adequately powered for
important clinical outcomes. The future RCT will test the hypothesis that the optimal mg/kg MK dose identified
in this R34 research improves outcomes as an additional anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator medication in
children with moderate and severe exacerbations. The overall Contribution of this research will be to identify an
optimal mg/kg dose of oral MK for the future RCT. The Significance of this R34 research and of the future RCT
is that high-dose oral montelukast will provide a critically needed medication for exacerbations to decrease the
morbidity of this common illness. This research is Innovative by (1) Identifying an optimal mg/kg dose for the
future RCT; (2) Providing preliminary efficacy and dose-response data; and (3) Repurposing an inexpensive
drug in a novel way to address an unmet need in children with asthma exacerbations. Completion of this re-
search will yield knowledge to decrease the morbidity and health burden of asthma exacerbations in children."
10837103,"Establishment of a multi-center biobank of patient-specific pluripotent stem cells for pediatric sepsis research.
PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Sepsis is the final common pathway among those with serious infections and kills more children than cancer
in the U.S each year. Yet, there are no therapies available for pediatric sepsis beyond early antibiotics and
organ support. Multiple levels of heterogeneity at the patient, organ, and cellular levels have significantly
impeded scientific progress. Although precision medicine approaches have been used to sift through patient-
level differences, we fundamentally lack a comprehensive understanding of how heterogeneous cellular
responses contribute to sepsis pathogenesis. Thus, there is a crucial need for human sepsis biorepositories to
unravel cell-specific mechanistic pathways and accelerate the development of novel sepsis therapeutics.
 We seek to bridge this gap by developing an unprecedented biobank of patient-specific induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) derived from children with sepsis. Human iPSCs can be used as a renewable and
expandable source of any cell type and have been used for precision modeling of numerous disease states.
However, it remains unknown whether they can serve as robust in vitro models of sepsis – an acute condition
with complex gene-environment interactions and driven primarily by the host response. Through this phased
innovation award, we seek to establish the ability of patient-specific iPSC derived cells to capture disease
phenotypes and recapitulate in vivo responses of circulating primary cell subsets in human sepsis.
 Milestone-driven developmental activities in the R21 phase will focus on establishment of an efficient
sample enrichment process to simultaneously collect and bank peripheral blood mononuclear cells for iPSC
generation, circulating primary leukocytes and endothelial cells, and serum from whole blood. We will then
generate quality-controlled iPSC lines, differentiate them into monocytes and endothelial cells, and perform
functional and phenotypic characterization of patient derived cells relative to those derived from healthy
donors. In the R33 phase, we will use state-of-the-art multiomic sequencing to determine if patient-specific
iPSC derived cells treated with risk-stratified septic serum mirror transcriptomic and epigenomic responses of
respective circulating primary cells. Scale up activities will include patient recruitment across multiple centers,
standardized protocols for iPSC generation and distribution, and development of a bioinformatic database that
will allow us to collate and contextualize omic analyses with rich clinical data. Through the successful
execution of this proposal, we seek to transform our existing pediatric sepsis biobank to meet the needs of the
next generation of scientific inquiry and facilitate cell-specific mechanistic research in human sepsis."
10798294,"Friedreich’s Ataxia (FRDA) is the most common autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder. The disease is
caused by expanded GAA repeats in the first intron of the frataxin (FXN) gene. No effective treatments for the
disease are available, owing to the expanded repeats remaining in the patients’ genome. Thus, a treatment that
targets the expanded GAA repeats is urgently needed. We found that the inhibition of H3K9 trimethylation
(H3K9me3) synergized with DNA base excision repair (BER) to contract the expanded GAA repeats and
upregulate FXN gene expression in FRDA neural cells and transgenic mouse brain. We hypothesize that GAA
repeat-targeted demethylation of H3K9me2/me3 at the FXN gene can disrupt heterochromatin and induce BER
to contract the expanded repeats. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a CRISPR/Cas9 system with the
histone H3-trimethyl-L-Lysine 9 demethylase 4D (KDM4D) fused to catalytically inactivated S. pyogenes Cas9
(CRISPR/dCas9-KDM4D) to induce GAA repeat-targeted demethylation of H3K9me2/me3 in FRDA neural cells.
We will pursue two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to determine if the GAA repeat-targeted CRISPR/dCas9-KDM4D can
demethylate H3K9me2/me3 to disrupt heterochromatin at the FXN gene in FRDA neural cells. First, we will fuse
the human KDM4D gene with the S. pyogenes dCas9 using the plasmid pCRISPR/dCas9-DNMT3A-PuroR_v2
as a backbone. KDM4D will be linked to the C-terminus of dCas9 through the XTEN80 linker chain. The
sequences for coding the single-strand guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that target the 5’- or 3’-flanking regions of the
expanded GAA repeats will also be inserted into the plasmid. The plasmid will be stably transfected into FRDA
neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of an FRDA patient.
Second, we will determine if the repeat-targeted dCas9-KDM4D can reduce the level of H3K9me2/me3 and
alleviate heterochromatinization on the expanded repeats in FRDA neural cells differentiated from NPCs. Aim 2
is to determine if the GAA repeat-targeted CRISPR/dCas9-KDM4D promotes GAA repeat contraction through
BER, leading to the upregulation of the FXN gene expression and the alleviation of mitochondrial dysfunction in
FRDA neural cells. First, we will determine if dCas9-KDM4D can lead to GAA repeat contraction. We will then
determine if dCas9-KDM4D can facilitate the recruitment of the key BER enzymes, DNA polymerase β (Pol β),
and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) to the expanded repeats in FRDA neural cells. Second, we will test if dCas9-
KDM4D can result in the upregulation of the FXN gene expression and alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction. Our
study will provide proof of concept for a gene-targeted contraction of expanded GAA repeats via the synergy
between histone modifications and DNA repair. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying
CRISPR/dCas9-KDM4D targeted contractions of expanded GAA repeats through the interplay of histone
demethylation with BER. The study will further open a new avenue to develop effective gene therapy for FRDA."
10783082,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Schwann cells (SCs) are neural crest derived cells whose primary function is the support and protection of
neurons in the peripheral nervous system. SCs can be divided into two subtypes: myelinating and non-
myelinating. Myelinating SCs form 1:1 relationships with neurons and ensheath them in myelin to provide rapid
conduction of nerve impulses, such as those required for transduction of proprioception and touch. In contrast,
non-myelinating SCs typically bundle multiple axons into nerve structures known as Remak bundles, which
support the cells but do not speed transmissions. Individuals with dysfunction of SCs exhibit a variety of
phenotypes which may include decreased sensation, weakness, and pain, and these diseases are among the
most common inherited conditions in humans. In addition, SCs are also the cell type targeted for tumorigenesis
in the Neurofibromatosis syndromes (NF1 and NF2) which ae associated with benign and malignant tumors of
the peripheral nerves and other locations. Rac1 is a small GTPase protein of the Rho family, and it has been
shown to essential for tumorigenesis in both NF1- and NF2-associated tumors, as well as other forms of inherited
Schwann cell tumors (e.g., Carney Complex). Recently, analyses of inherited SC dysfunctional syndromes have
also shown dysregulation of Rac1. To investigate the role of Rac1 signaling in SC function and tumorigenesis,
my laboratory has generated a mouse model carrying a conditionally active allele of Rac1 and performed
preliminary characterization of the effects of activation Rac1 at various stages of SC development. We observe
that activation of Rac1 in early embryogenesis enhanced cell proliferation and affects the ability of non-
myelinating SCs to form normal Remak bundles, which are completely absent from nerves with Rac1 activated
in early embryogenesis. In this R03 application, we hypothesize that Rac1 activation leads to aberrant
differentiation specifically in non-myelinating SCs without affecting the trajectory of myelinating SCs. Initial
characterization of this defect through this pilot grant application will lead to future studies with important
implications for nociception and for tumorigenesis.
To address this hypothesis, we propose the single Specific Aim to assess the differential effects of
activation of Rac1 on the transcriptomes of myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells. As a first
step, will compare the transcriptomes of WT SCs to the abnormal SCs in mice with SC-targeted early
activation of Rac1. Secondly, we will expand the analysis to include mice with later activation of Rac1, as these
animals appear to have morphologically and functional normal SCs. Thirdly, we will validate these data by
analyzing specific transcripts and proteins to verify the transcriptomic changes.
If successful, these studies will begin to elucidate the important molecular functions of Rac1 in mediating the
differentiation, physiologic function, and tumor implications of Schwann cells in vivo, with implications both for
understanding and treating pain, and for understanding SC tumorigenesis such as in NF."

The Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) aims to
train and prepare future leaders and physician-scientists in clinical medicine and biomedical research. Our
program trains diverse students across numerous fields, with a curriculum and training plan that is continuously
improved through metrics, critical self-assessment, and student input. Guiding principles of our program include:
(1) a rigor and caliber of both MD and PhD training equivalent to single-degree candidates; (2) continuous
mentoring from program leaders, faculty, and peers; and (3) training in translational research for all students.
The four program directors are all physician-scientists and each is active in research, graduate training, and
clinical activities. The student government works closely with the directors on recruitment, seminars, advising,
curriculum, and continuous improvement. Students begin with the preclinical phase of medical training, along
with a 3-semester MSTP-specific Integrated Molecular Medicine (IMM) course series, led by the directors. IMM
introduces new trainees to research methodologies, scientific writing, responsible conduct of research (RCR),
rigor, reproducibility and transparency (RRT), and implicit bias. Students then proceed through clinical clerkships
in the ForWard curriculum before beginning the Ph.D. thesis. Ph.D. mentor selection is made in consultation with
program leaders. Oversight of research rigor and Ph.D. mentorship is directly assured by an MSTP director on
each thesis committee. An integrated Longitudinal Clinical Experience spans the Ph.D. years. After defending
the Ph.D. thesis, trainees enter the final year of medical training, which includes the mentored Clinical &
Translational Research Elective (CTRE), custom-designed for MSTP trainees. CTRE is a 6-week preceptorship
with both clinical and research facets and an additional physician-scientist faculty mentor. The integrated
curriculum allows students to complete dual degree training in 7-8 years, with a minimal gap between intense
research activities and postgraduate training. A majority of student theses are in the biological, chemical,
population or engineering sciences, yet others select allied programs of study including anthropology, medical
history, and clinical investigation, a program integrated with our Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA).
Additional activities foster program cohesiveness and encompass continuous training in RCR, RRT and implicit
bias via weekly seminars, our annual retreat and yearly symposium, and regular social gatherings. A diversity
committee, jointly led by students and faculty, directs activities for recruitment and retention of exceptional
trainees, including a new summer research program for underrepresented undergraduates, which will be
implemented in the grant period. RELEVANCE: Trainees receive integrated training in clinical medicine and
research and are awarded both M.D. and Ph.D. degrees. Through an innovative integrated physician-scientist
curriculum, the diverse graduates of our program are poised for research-intensive careers that integrate
rigorous basic and translational research and clinical care."
10877829,"Puerto Ricans (PRs) are disproportionately affected with asthma. We have shown that psychosocial stressors
such as child maltreatment and exposure to violence (ETV) are associated with major depressive disorder (MDD)
and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), asthma, and worse asthma outcomes in PR children and adolescents. We
have also demonstrated that violence-related distress is associated with reduced response to short-acting
bronchodilators, and that increased violence-related distress over time is associated with worse lung function
and asthma-related quality of life in PR and non-PR children and adolescents. More recently, we found that high
ETV and high violence-related distress are associated with a Th2-high asthma endotype in two cohorts of PR
youth. In a separate study, we also recently demonstrated that ~38% of the estimated effects of child
maltreatment on asthma in British adults older than 40 years are mediated by MDD and/or GAD. However, it is
not known whether ETV and violence-related distress cause persistence of Th2-high asthma into early adulthood
or whether MDD and GAD (independently of or because of prior ETV) are associated with Th2-high asthma in
young PR adults. Indeed, we have very limited knowledge of the mechanisms underlying persistence of Th2-
high asthma, including a violence-related Th2-high asthma endotype, in young adults. Lack of such knowledge
is an important problem, because, without it, gaining the ability to prevent or treat violence-related asthma in
underserved populations is highly unlikely. Based on our novel preliminary results, we hypothesize that ETV and
violence-related distress leads to persistence of Th2-high asthma in young PR adults, and that these effects are
mediated or modified by MDD or GAD. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine examine whether high ETV
or high violence-related distress during childhood are associated with persistence of a Th2-high asthma
endotype and worse asthma severity or control in young PR adults (Specific [Sp.] Aim 1). We will then test for
association between high ETV or violence-related distress during childhood and MDD or GAD in young PR adults
(Sp. Aim 2). Next, we will examine whether MDD or GAD is associated with the presence of a Th2-high asthma
endotype and worse asthma severity or control in young PR adults (Sp. Aim 3a). Finally, we will assess whether
MDD or GAD modifies or mediates any estimated effects of high ETV and violence-related distress on Th2-high
asthma and asthma severity or control in young PR adults. This proposal should determine whether and how
ETV and violence-related distress forecast persistence of a Th2-high asthma endotype and worse asthma
severity or control among young adults in an ethnic group heavily burdened by asthma (PRs), while also
identifying novel pathways and mediators of distress-induced asthma. To achieve this goal, we have assembled
an outstanding multidisciplinary research team."

Our goal is to decipher how a molecular-level event or property can create heterogeneous behavior within a
population, and how this heterogeneity leads to advantages for the population as a whole that are not available
to individual members. We propose to determine how sub-generational gene expression - not only of individual
genes, but also of entire operons containing multiple genes with coordinated functions - creates mixed
populations that are more fit to respond to various environmental cues. This proposal, which deeply integrates
computational modeling and experimental measurement, arose out of our efforts in “whole-cell” modeling of E.
coli, which were reported in Science earlier this year. The E. coli model has predicted a number of surprising
behaviors; most relevant is the finding that a clear majority of the genes in E. coli are transcribed at a rate of
less than once per cell cycle - a phenomenon we call “sub-generational gene expression”. Such expression
can have negative consequences for individual bacteria, but benefits the bacterial population as a whole.
Because bacteria are unable to reliably anticipate future conditions, the population must always be prepared
for any environmental change - but no single bacterium is able to express all of the genes required to respond
to any environment at sufficient levels. Instead, our working hypothesis is that the population is heterogeneous,
comprised of individual members who are each prepared for a small number of possible environments. Thus,
while no single cell is ready for all environments, as a whole the population is prepared for most eventualities.
The colony is thus dominated by individuals, emerging stochastically via expression of sub-generationally
expressed genes, who are the most fit to survive at any given moment. Our groups combine expertise in both
whole-cell and agent-based models, and have been working towards whole-cell population simulations, in
which hundreds or thousands of cells each run an instantiation of the E. coli model. Our Aims are to: (1)
confirm that model-predicted genes are expressed sub-generationally; (2) computationally predict and
experimentally determine the effect of operon structure on sub-generational expression of functionally related
gene pairs; and (3) computationally predict and experimentally determine the phenotypic heterogeneity created
by operon separation in cell populations. The most impactful and pioneering aspects of our proposal are that
we will uncover a fundamental new role for operon structure in prokaryotic gene regulation; that we will
produce an expanded whole-cell model of previously unseen complexity, as well as highly innovative new
modeling technology; and finally, that this work will be the first to utilize a novel multi-scale simulation platform
that combines whole-cell models with agent-based models, including the most exciting experimental
demonstration of whole-cell and whole-colony modeling’s major potential: predicting large-scale emergent
properties to generate insights into complex cellular behaviors."

Pioneering clinical trials of hepatocyte-targeted liver gene therapy in hemophilias have established the principal
therapeutic efficacy of adenoassociated virus (AAV) vectors. Clinical trials have also revealed limitations of
current AAV vectors, mainly lower than expected therapeutic efficacy and dose-dependent toxicity undermining
both safety and efficacy. These clinical findings show that animal models, even monkeys or mice engrafted
with human hepatocytes, fail to accurately predict the performance of AAV vectors in humans. The limitations
of current AAV vectors need to be overcome for broad application of AAV liver gene therapy because most
liver diseases require more hepatocytes to be transduced to achieve a therapeutic effect than hemophilias. To
maximize the therapeutic effect that can be achieved within a safe AAV vector dose limit, we will identify AAV
capsids that transduce hepatocytes in the human liver with maximum efficiency but no or limited off-targeting.
For this, we will harness the near-clinical conditions provided by normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of
human livers. We will compare capsids currently used in clinical trials of liver gene therapy to engineered
capsids reported to efficiently target mouse liver or human hepatocytes engrafted in mice. To compare capsids
side by side, we have established analysis of AAV vector-expressed barcodes by single-cell RNA sequencing
of comprehensive cell populations isolated from human livers after NMP. We will also target capsids de novo in
human livers maintained by NMP by screening a library of 1 million chimeric capsids generated by shuffling of
the DNA sequences of naturally occurring AAV capsids. In addition to achieving unprecedented levels of
efficiency and specificity of transduction of hepatocytes, we aim to establish transduction of cholangiocytes,
thereby facilitating the development of gene therapies for biliary diseases. We will also target activated hepatic
stellate cells (myofibroblasts), the source of excessive collagen in liver fibrosis, and reactive cholangiocytes,
which form the ductular reaction characteristic for cholestatic liver diseases. Efficient and specific in vivo gene
delivery to these pathogenic and abundant cells will facilitate therapeutic strategies based on inactivation or
repurposing, for example, reprogramming into hepatocytes. By identifying or generating capsids that transduce
hepatocytes and other therapeutically relevant liver cell types with the highest level of efficiency and specificity
our results will directly inform clinical trials that are at the planning stage and provide the basis for extending
the reach of AAV liver gene therapy to common liver diseases like fatty liver disease and biliary diseases,
including liver fibrosis as their common end stage."

Tumor heterogeneity is the main cause of resistance to current chemotherapy drugs as well as metastasis
development, leading to patients' death. Within the same tumor from the same patient, tumor cells might be
subtly or even dramatically different, making it harder to treat clinically. Understanding mechanisms driving
cancer diversity is a critical step toward developing new strategies to attenuate tumor evolution and adaptation.
Genomic instability is a prominent source of genetic diversity within tumors, generating a cell population
subject to potential selection from a micro-environmental or therapeutic context. In recent years, next-
generation sequencing technologies have begun to identify genomic signatures of DNA damage and errors in
DNA repair processes, revealing new mechanisms causing an accumulation of mutations in cancer genomes.
From the 30 mutational signatures identified across many cancer types to date, one is particularly dominant:
the APOBEC signature. APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B), two members of the APOBEC3 family,
target TpC motifs on single-stranded DNA and are the major sources of the APOBEC mutational signature
detected in patients' tumor samples. Our preliminary observation identified a discrepancy between A3A and
A3B expression and mutation accumulation in cancer cells. On one hand, A3A is rarely found expressed, yet
many of the tumors have a strong A3A-mutational signature. On the other hand, A3B is expressed in most
cancer cells, but only a fraction has an A3B-mutational signature. Both A3A and A3B significantly increase
mutations in tumors, but these observations have led us to propose that A3A and A3B expression is not a
reliable way to assess the APOBEC status of cancer cells, as previously thought. We propose that A3A is
tightly regulated at the transcription level and transiently expressed to generate mutations. Our study will
explain why A3A is rarely found expressed in cancer but many cancers have a strong A3A mutational
signature. In contrast, we propose that A3B is regulated at the protein level to protect the genome against A3B
activity. Our goal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms that govern A3A and A3B regulation in cancer cells.
Our overall hypothesis is that cells exploit two separate mechanisms to regulate A3A and A3B and to protect
their genome against their activity. In addition, we propose that specific signals in cancer lead to the
deregulation of these protective mechanisms, causing a surge of mutations. Our Specific Aims are to 1)
define signaling pathways in cancer cells that regulate A3A expression and 2) identify protein complexes
controlling A3B activity in cancer cells. Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic strategies to suppress
mutations in the genome caused by A3A and A3B, leading to tumor heterogeneity, metastasis, and drug
resistance."

10836513,"OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall, long-term goal of “HOPE & CAIRHE 2gether (HC2)” is to increase the reach of evidence-based
cancer prevention and control interventions (EBIs) in areas of persistent poverty (PP). HC2 brings together the
expertise, infrastructure, partnerships, and resources of the Center for Health Outcomes and Population Equity
(HOPE), Huntsman Cancer Institute, and University of Utah, with the Center for American Indian and Rural
Health Equity (CAIRHE) and Montana State University. HC2’s community level, translational research
programs align with communities’ cultural beliefs, resources, and priorities; reach across the lifespan; and,
strategically partner with key “anchor organizations,” public health agencies, healthcare systems, American
Indian communities, and community organizations across five states. The HC2 Network brings together the
robust community partnerships across institutions to create a unique resource for advancing cancer prevention
in PP areas in the Mountain West, and HC2 is guided by a Community and Scientific Advisory Board. Projects
1 and 2 address the major drivers of the disproportionate burden of cancer among PP areas and populations.
Project 1 partners with Community Health Centers (CHCs) to address tobacco cessation and mitigate the
negative impacts of the social determinants of health (SDOH) among CHC patients in Utah who use tobacco
and live in PP census tracts (majority Latino). Project 2 partners with Cooperative Extension Systems (CES) to
address obesity prevention and SDOH among American Indian communities located in PP census tracts in
Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wisconsin (all census tracts are rural/frontier). Both Projects include
Project Steering Committees and Project 2 includes Local Community Advisory Boards in each community.
An overarching theme creating synergy across HC2 activities and research is increasing “Reach through
Equitable Implementation.” As such, HC2 implementation strategies are specifically tailored to local and
community contexts. HC2’s structure and function creates substantial synergy to advance cancer prevention
research in areas and populations experiencing persistent poverty via: Complementary areas of expertise,
experience, community engagement, and leadership across institutions; Innovative, comprehensive, multi-
level, conceptual framework targeting Reach through Equitable Implementation, with shared research foci
that drive the research programs; Multi-faceted, cross-institutional training program that leverages the
complementary strengths and access to trainee populations across Utah and Montana; and, Combining deep
and extensive community engagement and robust partnerships across institutions to create the HC2 Network,
which will help bridge the gap between scientific discovery and the implementation of EBIs in areas of PP. In
sum, HC2 will build on existing expertise, research infrastructures, and longstanding partnerships to serve as a
regional and national leader in community-engaged cancer prevention and control research in areas of PP."
10836523,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
HOPE and CAIRHE 2gether (HC2) is built upon the shared goal of improving cancer prevention services and
outcomes in areas characterized by persistent poverty (PP) via “Reach through Equitable Implementation.”
HC2 is a partnership between the Center for Health Outcomes and Population Equity (HOPE) at Huntsman
Cancer Institute (HCI) and University of Utah (U of U), and the Center for American Indian and Rural Health
Equity (CAIRHE) at Montana State University (MSU). The HC2 Administrative Core (Admin) is a critical
interface among Projects, Cores, and community partners, and between HC2 and the Persistent Poverty
Initiative Network (PPIN). HC2’s Admin combines the strengths of two unique centers, HOPE and CAIRHE, to
provide leadership, oversight, and evaluation of HC2 as a whole, its Cores, its Projects, and its early career
investigator development programs—all in the fulfillment of HC2’s mission to improve cancer prevention and
outcomes in areas of PP, especially among populations most impacted in the Mountain West (i.e., American
Indian, Latino, rural/frontier). HC2 will become a regional and national leader in health equity research in PP
areas, building on our already robust foundation of community partners to expand and maintain a broad
collection of healthcare, public health, tribal organizations, and other health equity stakeholders through its
Health Equity Network to Address Cancer Prevention in Areas of Persistent Poverty (HC2 Network). HC2
would be the only multidisciplinary center of its kind in the Mountain West and the HC2 Network would be a
unique regional resource. Under the leadership of HC2 Multiple Principal Investigators (MPIs) David Wetter,
PhD (Contact PI), and Alexandra Adams, MD, PhD, Admin will oversee the progress of the Center’s two
Research Projects (Leaders Schlechter, Estabrooks, Wetter, Tomayko, Adams) and Pilot Projects, along with
the Cores. Admin will establish and convene a robust Community and Scientific Advisory Board (CSAB) and
ensure regular review of all HC2 Projects and Cores by the HC2 Executive Committee and CSAB to ensure
HC2’s success. Admin will also conduct community engagement and outreach activities, fostering collaborative
partnerships with communities (HC2 Network) in support of the Projects and Cores. Strong leadership,
management, and evaluation from Admin will result in more effective Projects and Cores. Moreover, HC2’s
Projects and Cores will refine and improve the way health equity research for cancer prevention is practiced in
tribal and PP communities regionally and nationally. Through these leadership and organizational efforts,
Admin will empower transdisciplinary teams, provide support to early-career investigators, and foster the HC2
Network to enable robust, culturally sensitive community-engaged research addressing cancer prevention and
control among populations living in persistent poverty areas. We will leverage existing infrastructure at HCI, U
of U, and MSU to maximize the impact of HC2’s Research Projects and community-engagement work."
10836524,"RESEARCH AND METHODS CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Research and Methods Core (RMC) will drive the application of innovative methodologic solutions to
the challenges of implementing evidence-based interventions for the prevention of cancer among people living
in persistent poverty. The central goal is achieving reach through equitable implementation to meet the needs
and resources of delivery systems that serve youth, families, and individuals in areas of persistent poverty. The
RMC will support the research activities of “HOPE & CAIRHE 2gether” (HC2) through three specific aims:
Aim 1: INNOVATE: Serve as a hub for cross-project methodologic synergies to advance cancer prevention
implementation science in persistent poverty areas. The RMC will ensure proper application of novel
implementation research tools while highlighting unique methodologic advancements facilitated by HC2's
collaborative structure. Central to this aim are innovations facilitated by three methods developed by RMC Co-
Lead Smith: (1) the Implementation Research Logic Model; (2) an implementation outcomes common data
elements tool; and (3) a novel and rigorous system for longitudinal tracking of implementation strategies and
their dynamic modifications over time. Aim 2: SUPPORT: Ensure methodologic support for HC2 research
activities. The RMC will ensure that HC2's Research and Pilot Projects have excellent methodologic support to
carry out their specific aims and those of HC2 overall. Specifically, the RMC will identify common data
elements, orchestrate the use of shared measures, and provide rigorous quantitative, qualitative, health
economic analyses and implementation science methods across the Research and Pilot Projects. We will use
quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods approaches to answer each project's stated specific aims as well as
novel and convergent research questions that emerge through HC2's work. Aim 3: EVALUATE: Measure HC2
research productivity and impact. The RMC will collaborate with the Administrative Core to measure and
evaluate HC2's progress toward achieving research and training milestones and outcomes. We will use the
Translational Science Benefits Model to demonstrate the impact of our work in the real world on metrics
salient to HC2 and the Persistent Poverty Initiative (RFA-CA-22-015).
The RMC is Co-Led by experts with complementary expertise in prevention implementation science
methods, research design, and quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods analysis. Four workgroups will
carry out RMC's aims: (1) Implementation Evaluation & Measurement; (2) Biostatistics & Research Design; (3)
Qualitative & Mixed Methods; and (4) Health Economics. RMC will coordinate with the Administrative Core,
Career Enhancement Core, and Community Engagement Team to ensure methodologic support and rigor
across HC2 activities. RMC's contributions will generate critical methodologic advances towards reducing the
cancer mortality disparities experienced by individuals living in persistent poverty."
10836525,"PROJECT 1: PROJECT SUMMARY
Tobacco use is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States, and is associated with at least 16
different types of cancers. Though nationwide rates have declined, tobacco use has become concentrated in
populations that have been historically marginalized and plays a critical role in health inequities, accounting
for 34% of the socioeconomic gradient in all-cause mortality and 62% in smoking related diseases, including
cancers of the lip/oral cavity/pharynx, esophagus, larynx, trachea, and lung. These populations also experience
adverse Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), which frequently co-occur with tobacco use, and contribute to
limited access and engagement with evidenced-based interventions (EBIs) for tobacco cessation. Consequently,
addressing SDOH and tobacco use concurrently may address barriers to engaging in EBIs for tobacco cessation
and ultimately reduce the impact of tobacco use among individuals living in poverty. However, the
effectiveness and cost effectiveness of strategies to concurrently increase the reach of EBIs for tobacco
cessation and mitigate the effects of SDOH among individuals living in persistent poverty areas is unknown.
The proposed project, Reach through Equitable Implementation in Utah (REI-UT), is a pragmatic, multilevel
Type III Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation trial with a 2x2 factorial experimental design. REI-UT will be
conducted with 6 Community Health Center (CHC) systems and 14 primary care clinics across Utah that serve
~1560 patients who use tobacco and live in persistent poverty census tracts. REI-UT utilizes an innovative
bundled approach to address adverse SDOH and tobacco use concurrently, and leverages ubiquitous health
information technology/telehealth for both the evidence-based intervention (EBI) delivery modality (i.e., the
Utah Tobacco Quit Line) and for dissemination and implementation (D&I) strategies. The clinic and patient-
level D&I strategies utilize widely adopted Electronic Health Record (EHR) capabilities, mobile phone—based
conversational agents (CA), and telephone–based patient navigation (PN) approaches to address adverse
SDOH and increase the reach of the Quit Line. Sustainability is enhanced by utilizing an existing, free,
nationally available EBI for tobacco cessation. The aims are to 1) Test the ability of patient level (CA & PN)
dissemination strategies to increase the Reach (primary outcome) of evidence-based tobacco cessation
treatment delivered via the Quit Line among CHC patients who use tobacco and live in persistent poverty
census tracts. Secondary analyses will examine the outcome of Reach of services for SDOH among these
patients, and will evaluate both (1) patient level CA and PN strategies, and (2) clinic level strategy (Ask –
Advise – Connect [AAC] for SDOH) using a pre-post design; 2) Explore contextual factors related to the Reach,
Adoption, Implementation, and potential Maintenance of strategies; and 3) Determine cost-effectiveness of
clinic and patient level strategies based on Quit Line enrollment and receipt of services for SDOH."
10836526,"PROJECT 2: PROJECT SUMMARY
American Indian (AI) communities experience profound health and economic inequities across the lifespan,
including increased risk for obesity, cancer, food insecurity (FI), and poverty. Overwhelming evidence indicates
obesity prevention evidence-based interventions (EBIs) reduce cancer risk, but the degree to which EBIs have
been developed in culturally relevant ways or to reach large numbers of AI families is extremely limited.
Community engaged dissemination and implementation (CEDI) strategies are needed across multiple social
ecological levels to increase EBI adoption, implementation, and maintenance in AI communities. Our objective
is to increase the reach of EBIs for cancer and obesity prevention among AI families who live in persistent
poverty areas (PPAs). The proposed project, Reach through Equitable Implementation of Turtle Island Tales in
AI Communities (REI-Turtle Island), is a participatory action research project designed to improve local
capacity for sustained EBI impact. Turtle Island Tales is a family-focused, home-based EBI for childhood
obesity prevention named to acknowledge Turtle Island as the term for North America used by many AI
communities. REI-Turtle Island will be conducted across four state Cooperative Extension Systems serving as
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education (SNAP-Ed) agencies in AI communities with ~4,000
children and their families in PPAs in rural and frontier areas. REI-Turtle Island engages system, community,
and organizational partners to identify, refine, and develop CEDI strategies to address both disease prevention
FI. A Project Steering Committee and Local Community Advisory Boards will conduct iterative planning and
evaluation using outcomes specified in the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance
(RE-AIM) framework. For Aim 1, we will facilitate and evaluate the reach of T-Tales in PPAs within AI
communities in Montana, Oregon, South Dakota, and Wisconsin when delivered by Extension/SNAP-Ed;
determine the effectiveness of T-Tales for health behavior change, and evaluate the reduction in FI among
participating families by facilitating connections with community and system-level resources (e.g., SNAP,
WIC). For Aim 2, we will evaluate the state-level adoption, implementation, and organizational maintenance
capacity of Extension/SNAP and AI communities for T-Tales and determine budget impacts of implementing
T-Tales into sustained Extension/SNAP-Ed delivery. We expect to generate a novel CEDI Strategies Toolkit to
move obesity and cancer prevention EBIs into sustained community implementation and account for the
unique social and cultural contexts in AI communities in PPAs. Findings will advance the field of CEDI science
through the co-production of strategies to influence EBI adoption, implementation, and maintenance using an
innovative conceptual framework that leverages social ecological, dissemination and implementation,
behavioral, and health equity frameworks to prevent obesity and cancer in AI families in PPAs."

by community engagement specialists and community members. CEC will create synergy with Projects 1 and 2,
Developmental Core, and Research and Methods Core by assisting Scholars in joining project teams,
submitting and leading Pilot Projects, and by embedding them in the Research and Methods Core.
 CEC will link HC2 Scholars to community partners from the HC2 Network in collaboration with the
Community Engagement Team housed in the Administrative Core to develop and conduct community-engaged
research that is based on partner priorities and sensitive to cultural values. CEC will also leverage numerous
programs and opportunities for ensuring that this next generation of investigators reflects the diversity of the
persistent poverty communities in the Mountain West region. CEC Co-Leads, Dr. Kolawole Okuyemi (U of U)
and Dr. Suzanne Held (MSU), bring distinct but complementary expertise to the CEC – national leadership in
mentoring and in creating and maintaining a diverse biomedical research workforce (Okuyemi) and
community-engaged research and training in rural and underserved settings (Held).
CEC will foster positive advances in the science and outcomes around cancer health equity in areas of
persistent poverty by ensuring that HC2 Scholars have a deep understanding of methods for conducting
community-engaged research, knowledge of the social determinants of health, a commitment to conducting
research that addresses reach through equitable implementation of cancer prevention interventions and
implementation strategies, and the skills to translate knowledge into action, enabling HC2 Scholars to work

 The HOPE & CAIRHE 2gether (HC2) Developmental Core will identify and develop high-quality projects
addressing cancer prevention and control in persistent poverty (PP) areas. HC2 brings together the expertise,
infrastructure, and resources of HC2’s participating centers and institutions: Center for Health Outcomes and
Population Equity (HOPE), Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI), and the University of Utah (U of U), with the
Center for American Indian and Rural Health Equity (CAIRHE) and Montana State University (MSU). HC2’s
translational research programs strategically partner with key agencies, tribal communities, and community
anchor organizations across five states to increase the use of evidence-based cancer prevention and control
interventions (EBIs) in census tracts characterized by PP. HC2 will achieve its goals through community-
engaged dissemination and implementation (CEDI) research that is considerate of and aligns with
communities’ cultural beliefs, priorities, and resources. Using the Center for HOPE, CAIRHE, and HC2
community partnerships as foundations, the HC2 Developmental Core will: 1) create and maintain a
collaborative research community focused on cancer prevention and control in PP areas, 2) solicit, sponsor,
and assist in the development of new Pilot Projects, and 3) monitor and support the progress of Pilot Projects.
The Developmental Core will work closely with the Career Enhancement Core, Research and Methods Core,
and Community Engagement Team (CE Team) of the Administrative Core to assist early career faculty in
developing, submitting, and monitoring Pilot Projects. Project proposals by early career faculty will be
prioritized, and those investigators will receive mentoring from senior faculty and the CE Team.
 The Developmental Core anticipates supporting 3-5 Pilot Projects at any one time depending on size of
awards, with at least one being an intervention. A two-stage submission process will ensure strong alignment
with the overall HC2 theme of increasing “Reach through Equitable Implementation,” and on HC2 specific foci:
Social Determinants of Health (SDOH), lung cancer prevention (tobacco, radon, screening, air quality), obesity
prevention, and innovative CEDI strategies. This process also will allow prospective Pilot Project investigators
to have early engagement with the Research and Methods Core and the CE Team.
 The HC2 Developmental Core will ensure a constant pipeline of meritorious projects in cancer prevention
and control in PP areas, particularly focused on “Reach through Equitable Implementation” and HC2 foci.
These projects will result in a community of new and established researchers poised to secure independent
funding to significantly impact cancer-related health inequities in PP areas across the Mountain West and
beyond."
10811790,"Summary
Non-topographic, intermixed representations (salt-and-pepper maps) of sensory information are common in
cerebral cortex, but how neural coding and plasticity are organized within them is unclear. We propose that
salt-and-pepper maps contain distinct pyramidal (PYR) subnetworks with differential roles in coding stability
and flexibility (including learning and attentional modulation). To test this, we study the whisker map in layer
2/3 of mouse somatosensory cortex (S1), where PYR cells tuned for the columnar whisker (CW) and for non-
columnar (non-CW) whiskers are intermixed in each column. We recently discovered that non-CW tuned cells
show marked tuning instability across days, while CW-tuned cells have stable tuning. This reveals that the
L2/3 salt-and-pepper map has two components: a stable columnar map of CW-tuned cells, intermixed with
non-CW tuned cells that are unstably tuned and have little columnar topography. We propose that CW- and
non-CW tuned cells are distinct PYR subcircuits with different roles in coding and plasticity.
 This is a novel model of S1 circuit function. We predict that the CW network provides coding stability,
while non-CW cells are the primary site for plasticity and learning. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize
that tuning instability in non-CW cells is internally driven, and acts to sample novel sensory codes which may
then be stabilized by experience or reward. This is a novel hypothesis for how sensory maps balance stability
and plasticity—by segregating these functions in different subcircuits. In Aim 1, we use longitudinal 2-photon
calcium imaging to understand the nature and origins of tuning instability, and to test whether experience or
reinforcement stabilizes whisker tuning. In Aim 2, we evaluate whether CW and non-CW networks represent
distinct functional networks with different sensory coding and plasticity properties. We test our central
hypothesis that non-CW cells are the primary locus of sensory plasticity and learning within the map.
 Aim 3 asks how attention modulates neural coding within intermixed maps. We developed a selective
attention task in which mice use history-dependent cues to guide attention to a specific whisker to improve
detection performance. Mice show robust spatial attention to cued whiskers. Attention lasts ~10 sec and is
driven by recent pairing of whisker stimuli with reward. Preliminary data show that attention enhances
whisker-evoked activity of PYR cells encoding the attended whisker in S1. This establishes S1 as a powerful
site to study cortical mechanisms of attention. We will use 2-photon imaging and Neuropixels recording to
study how attention modulates sensory coding in S1, including measuring the size and CW- or non-CW
network specificity of the attentional spotlight. In a major effort, we use imaging and optogenetics to identify
the control circuits for attention in S1, with initial focus on VIP interneurons.
 Together, these studies will reveal how plasticity and attentional modulation are organized within a
canonical salt-and-pepper map."

Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) is an autoimmune and autoinflammatory disease which targets the aorta and its major
branch vessels. GCA causes vaso-occlusive disease, leading to blindness and stroke. About half of the patients
develop GCA aortitis, a potentially life-threatening complication due to aortic dissection and aneurysm formation.
The underlying disease process is a granulomatous arteritis, with CD4 T cells, macrophages and multinucleated
giant cells infiltrating into the vessel wall, eliciting maladaptive wall remodeling with neoangiogenesis and lumen-
occlusive intimal hyperplasia.
We have identified aberrant expression of the oncogene NOTCH1 in CD4 T cells as a key abnormality in the
immune system of GCA patients. Here, we will examine the hypothesis that NOTCH signaling transforms
protective immunity into pathogenic immunity by suppressing the mitochondrial enzyme succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH) and truncating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Fragmentation of the TCA cycle
then leads to the accumulation of the metabolic intermediate succinate, which is released into the tissue
site and functions as a second messenger. We propose that succinate secreted by NOTCH1hi SDHlo CD4
T cells targets surrounding cells to redirect T effector cell differentiation, to induce multinucleated
macrophages and to promote microvascular neoangiogenesis. We have assembled key enabling resources
to mechanistically study how NOTCH-instructed succinate release enhances vascular inflammation; including a
large cohort of clinically well phenotyped GCA patients and a chimeric mouse model in which vasculitis is induced
in engrafted human arteries to corroborate in vitro data by in vivo studies. Aim 1 will define the molecular
mechanisms leading to NOTCH-dependent SDH loss-of-function, building on preliminary studies that implicate
RNA-binding proteins in regulating SDH mRNA stability through N6-methyladenosine modifications. Aim 2A
examines mechanistically how succinate reprograms T effector cell differentiation. Experiments are designed to
investigate how succinate paralyzes the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20/TNFAIP3 to unleash NF-kappaB signaling and
induce polyfunctional effector T cells (Thpoly), including T cells that co-produce IFN-, IL-17, TNF-α, IL-21 and
IL-22. Aim 2B will determine how NOTCH-instructed succinate alters macrophage function, specifically by
driving formation of tissue-destructive multinucleated giant cells. We will delineate how succinate elicits a robust
DNA damage response and how it promotes nuclear division and halts cytokinesis by interfering with the spindle
assembly checkpoint. Aim 2C is focused on succinate’s role in inducing a pro-angiogenic endothelial cell (EC)
phenotype and will explore how succinate-trained EC migrate, proliferate, and lose their barrier function. Aim 3
will bridge from the bench to the bedside and will test whether the suppression of succinate production by
blocking the upstream enzyme a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase can successfully treat vasculitis in vivo."
10873963,"Human milk bioactive proteins are degraded during commonly used Holder pasteurization of donor milk. Alternative processing techniques that ensure biosafety while preserving bioactive proteins are needed, particularly for at-risk preterm infants. High pressure processing (HPP) and ultraviolet-C irradiation (UV-C) treatment are known to preserve a few bioactive milk proteins, but no systematic research has identified the minimum processing parameters and their effects on the entire array of milk proteins’ structure and function. There is a critical need to perform this research. Our long-term goal is to optimize feeding practices for preterm infants to improve their health outcomes. The objectives of this research are to identify the minimum HPP and UV-C treatment conditions that achieve equivalent microbiological safety to Holder pasteurization while optimally preserving bioactive protein structure and function. Our central hypothesis is that minimal HPP and UV-C treatment conditions will better preserve donor milk bioactive proteins’ structure and function compared with Holder pasteurization. Our hypothesis is based on our work and that of others indicating that HPP and UV- C treatment preserve some bioactive proteins. The rationale for this work is that it can lead to changes in donor milk processing that can improve bioactive protein retention and possibly infant health outcomes. Aim 1. Determine treatment conditions for HPP and UV-C pasteurization that maximize bioactive protein preservation compared with Holder pasteurization. Minimal conditions for HPP and UV-C biosafety will be determined and retention of bioactive milk proteins will be compared between unpasteurized, Holder pasteurized, HPP-treated and UV-C-treated donor milk via ELISA and proteomics analyses. Our working hypothesis is that minimal-condition HPP and UV-C-treated donor milk will have higher retention of bioactive proteins than Holder pasteurized donor milk. Aim 2. Identify the extent to which preserved bioactive proteins maintain their bioactivities after treatment with HPP and UV-C pasteurization. Bioactivity will be examined in whole milk and fractionated protein extracts of unpasteurized and Holder, HPP and UV-C pasteurized donor milk. Our working hypothesis is that HPP and UV-C treated donor milk proteins will retain a higher degree of their bioactivities compared with Holder pasteurized donor milk as determined by in vitro antibacterial, anti-adhesive, antiviral and immunomodulatory assays, lipase and protease assays. We expect to have determined the extent to which minimally processed HPP and UV-C treatment preserves bioactive proteins’ structure and function compared with Holder pasteurization. The positive impact of this research will be guidance for donor milk processors on how to optimally process donor milk for feeding preterm infants and information for clinicians on how to evaluate available donor milk sources. Changes in milk processing to better preserve bioactive milk proteins could improve preterm infant health outcomes."
10872120,"Abstract:
 Transitions of care (TOC) for patients with cancer are complex situations that increase risks for poor patient
outcomes and adverse events. Our proposal is built on the Chronic Care Model evidence that informed, activated
patients could provide meaningful feedback on their experiences and perceptions of safety in the context of care
transitions, promoting productive interactions through timely responses and support toward improved outcomes.
To leverage self-management via the support of information technology systems, we propose a consumer-
oriented patient safety event (PSE) platform to engage patients with cancer and their families to report medication
adverse events during TOC and improve the understanding of the nature and causes of PSE. Despite the
feasibility of consumer-oriented PSE reporting has been established, it remains largely unknown how to engage
patients and families in using the reporting systems, especially how to mitigate the identified barriers such as
patient factors, insufficient system design features, and mismatch between technology platform and objectives
for patients and families to involve in PSE reporting during TOC. We chose the priority population who are under
the treatment of oral anticancer agents (OAA) at home since they face specific medication safety and self-
management challenges, including complex regimens and life-threatening toxicities, as well as high potentials
for drug-drug and drug-food interactions.
 Application of the PSE reporting system is innovative in the OAA management process, which will improve
care transitions by enhancing patient communication and care coordination, thereby reducing and mitigating
adverse events. The platform built upon the AHRQ common formats is expected to defragment information and
utilize community resources regarding OAA adverse events and self-management, interoperable with prevailing
event reporting systems, and compatible with federal data sources in aggregating, trending events via patient
safety organizations. Our approach based on rigorous theoretical frameworks for improving patient engagement
is scalable to other chronic conditions during transitions of care. This proposal is focused on supporting patient
self-management activities during care transitions back home, responding to the AHRQ priority of matching the
technology platform to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes."
10880717,"Despite significant reductions in mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT), HIV infection during breastfeeding
still occurs at unacceptably high rates, contributing to 150,000 new infections annually. Children are more
susceptible to AIDS-related illnesses than adults, with those under two years of age being more likely to succumb
to rapid disease progression than any other age group. Rapid progression in infants is characterized by immune
dysfunction that can include CD4 T cell depletion, B cell dysfunction and hypo-gammaglobulinemia (low plasma
levels of IgM/IgG). To investigate different rates of disease progression in infants, SIV-infected (SIV+) infant
rhesus macaques have proven to be a valuable model system, recapitulating several aspects of pediatric HIV
infection. Using this model, the Sodora laboratory identified a rapid progressor (RP) phenotype encompassing
high SIV plasma viremia and low or undetectable levels of SIV-specific antibodies. Additional analyses revealed
that RP infant macaques exhibit elevated and sustained type-1 Interferon (IFN-1) levels following the acute stage
of the infection, IFN-induced protein expression within B cell follicles (BCF), and that these changes were
associated with germinal center dysfunction within lymphoid tissues. These differences raise important questions
about the mechanism by which sustained IFN-1 signaling potentially contributes to rapid HIV/SIV disease
progression, as well as the relationship between progression rate and response to combination antiretroviral
therapy (cART), immune recovery following treatment, and establishment and maintenance of the latent viral
reservoir. Previous studies from Dr. Chahroudi’s laboratory (proposal co-investigator) revealed differences in the
latent SIV reservoir in infant compared to adult macaques, including a bias toward naïve CD4 T cells in harboring
the majority of latently infected cells in infants. These findings lead to our central hypotheses: 1. Rapid
progression in SIV+ infant macaques results from an elevated and prolonged type-1 IFN response that inhibits
formation of effective germinal centers in lymph nodes as well as an insufficient anti-SIV humoral immune
response. 2. Rapid progression in infants results in delayed immune recovery and a larger latent reservoir during
administration of combination antiretroviral therapy. Aim 1 will assess the ability of transiently administered IFN-
1 receptor antagonist, during the post-acute infection period to influence disease progression and immune
outcome in infant macaques. Aims 2 and 3 will evaluate the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy on immune
recovery and latent viral reservoirs in both the RP and typically progressing infant macaques. Over the last 20
years, the Sodora laboratory has investigated immune factors that modulate SIV oral transmission and disease
progression in the rhesus macaque model, and the experiments outlined here expand upon these previous
studies. Undertaking experiments outlined in this proposal has the potential to identify therapeutic targets for
HIV+ infants with distinct disease trajectories and will provide insights into immune therapeutic approaches that
to aid in immune recovery and reservoir reduction."
10860979,"This application requests support for a training program that prepares highly qualified pediatricians to assume
leadership positions as investigators in Pediatric Infectious Diseases. Based in the Division of Infectious
Diseases at Boston Children’s Hospital, the program takes advantage of the rich academic and research
resources of Harvard Medical School, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and affiliated teaching
hospitals to bring together outstanding didactic experiences and research opportunities relevant to infectious
diseases of children. Support for three positions per year is requested. Pediatricians enter the program for a
minimum of three years of integrated clinical and research training that includes at least two years of
supervised research under the mentorship of a member of the teaching faculty. The 31 members of the
teaching faculty are accomplished investigators and experienced mentors chosen from the Division of
Infectious Diseases at Boston Children’s Hospital and affiliated units at other Harvard institutions. Under the
guidance of the research mentor and the Program Steering Committee, an individualized curriculum is
designed for each trainee in one of three broad areas of investigation: microbial pathogenesis, host response
and vaccines, or epidemiology and health outcomes. Trainees in the epidemiology and health outcomes
pathway have the opportunity to earn a Master of Public Health degree from the Harvard School of Public
Health as an integral part of the training program, providing training in epidemiology, biostatistics, clinical trial
design, and analytical methods. Additional specialized training in infection control, antimicrobial stewardship, or
transplant infectious diseases is also offered. All trainees have seminars and tutorials in grant preparation and
scientific writing that supplement the mentored research experience. An individual Scholarship Oversight
Committee is appointed for each trainee to monitor progress and to provide career guidance. During the
second or third year, trainees are expected to present their work at national meetings, to prepare one or more
manuscripts for publication, and, in most cases, to apply for a K08, K23, or other career development award to
support the transition to independence as an investigator. Over the past ten years of the Pediatric Infectious
Diseases fellowship program, 27 of 30 graduates have remained in academic positions, with 15 involved in
research-based investigation, and 12 involved in primarily clinical academic activities."
10840960,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by cognitive impairment
and progressive neurodegeneration. Genome-wide association studies of AD have identified more than 30 risk
loci; however, a major challenge in the field is that the majority of these risk factors are harbored within non-
coding regions where their impact on AD pathogenesis has been difficult to establish. Therefore, the molecular
basis of AD development and progression remains elusive and, so far, reliable treatments have not been
found.
 AD-associated changes in the regulation of the epigenome can result from primary genetic and non-genetic
causal factors and epiphenomena, including changes secondary to disease progression. Thus, the epigenome
is a strong proxy marker to study late-onset diseases such as AD, where there can be a gap of multiple
decades between initiation of disease progression and the appearance of symptoms. In the original R01 grant
titled “Higher Order Chromatin and Genetic Risk for Alzheimer's Disease”, we expanded the panel of molecular
markers in the Mount Sinai Brain Bank AD cohort by generating cell type-specific (neurons and non-neurons)
ATACseq in the entorhinal cortex and superior temporal gyrus of AD cases and controls. By doing so, we
identified shared and distinct regulatory genomic signatures associated with clinical dementia and
neuropathological lesions and with early and late stages of AD. Overlap with AD common risk variants
identified primary chromatin accessibility perturbations that are driven by genetic variation, compared to
secondary changes with no apparent genetic origin.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to address the limitations of our previous research by examining
and validating AD-related changes on chromatin accessibility and the 3D genome at the single cell level.
Based on recent data from our group and others, we hypothesize that genotype-phenotype associations in AD
are causally mediated by cell type-specific alterations in the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. To
test our hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) perform multimodal (i.e., within cell) profiling of
the chromatin accessibility and transcriptome at the single cell level to identify cell type-specific AD-related
changes on the 3D genome; (2) fine-map AD risk loci to identify causal variants, regulatory regions and genes;
(3) functionally validate putative causal variants and regulatory sequences using novel approaches that
combine massively parallel reporter assays, CRISPR and single cell assays in neurons and microglia derived
from induced pluripotent stem cells; and (4) develop and maintain a community workspace that provides for the
rapid dissemination and open evaluation of data, analyses, and outcomes. Overall, our multidisciplinary
computational and experimental approach will provide a compendium of functionally and causally validated AD
risk loci that has the potential to lead to new insights and avenues for therapeutic development."
10849800,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic viral infections continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Viruses often evade or
suppress the host immunity to establish persistent infections. The clone 13 strain (Cl 13) of lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) induces a profound immune suppression and persists in the mouse. LCMV Cl
13 infection of mice has served as a valuable model system for the mechanistic study of viral regulation of host
immunity and virus persistence. Sphingosine kinase (SK) 2 mediates the synthesis of sphingosine 1-phosphate
(S1P) from sphingosine and controls diverse cellular conditions. However, the function of SK2 in host immune
responses to virus infection remains poorly understood. The preliminary data demonstrate that SK2 deficiency
in mice results in heightened T cell responses to LCMV Cl 13 infection, leading to lethal immunopathology
associated with kidney disease. The data also indicate that LCMV Cl 13 increases the activation of SK2 in
CD4+ T cells, which inhibits the expansion of virus-specific T cells. Importantly, the oral administration of the
SK2-specific inhibitor into LCMV Cl 13-infected mice accelerates the clearance of the persistent infection.
Therefore, the following research aims are developed to uncover the regulatory function of SK2 in virus-
induced immune suppression, immune pathology, and virus persistence. First, the role of SK2 in CD4+ T cell
suppression will be investigated during persistent LCMV Cl 13 infection as well as using human T cells from
patients chronically infected with viruses. Second, the molecular mechanism by which SK2 suppresses virus-
specific CD4+ T cell responses and restricts immune pathology will be determined upon LCMV infection. Lastly,
the proposed study will further determine the therapeutic efficacy of the SK2-specific inhibitor during persistent
LCMV infection and assess the features of the host immunity regulated by SK2 inhibition. Taken together, this
research is expected to elucidate the mechanism by which SK2 regulates virus-specific T cell responses, and
to define the function of SK2 in the imbalanced immune mechanism that can cause either immune pathologic
kidney disease or persistent viral infection. The project could provide a framework for developing new immune
therapeutic interventions for controlling chronic virus infections."
10810795,"Project Summary
The broad, long-term objective of this application is to generate an efficient, effective decision-support system to
augment postoperative triage, transfer, and discharge decisions that affect more than 15 million patients in the
United States annually. Evidence from single-institution studies suggests that postoperative overtriage of low
acuity patients to intensive care units (ICUs) is associated with low value of care (outcomes/costs) compared
with general ward admission, and that undertriage of high acuity patients to general wards is associated with
increased mortality. These associations require validation externally and prospectively. In addition, further
investigation is needed to determine whether there are similar, identifiable misalignments between patient acuity
and resource intensity occurring throughout postoperative hospital admission and at the time of hospital
discharge. Our central hypothesis is that aligning automated, data-driven patient acuity assessments with
postoperative resource intensity using explainable, fair, uncertainty-aware deep learning models will be
associated with decreased mortality and increased value of care. We will test our central hypothesis by
performing three sets of related but independent experiments. First, we will externally validate an interoperable
version of our postoperative triage classification system, initially using retrospective data at 42 hospitals across
four institutions, then performing similar analyses with retrospective data on a federated learning platform, and
finally using prospective data from 15 hospitals at two institutions. Second, we will generate continuous
postoperative patient acuity assessments with novel DL architectures using multicenter, multimodal (including
clinical notes), retrospective EHR data at three hospitals within a single institution. Third, we will critically evaluate
and optimize model certainty and fairness using retrospective data at 43 hospitals across four institutions,
generate an EHR-embedded decision-support system, and perform prospective decision support usability
testing and optimization at two institutions. The proposed research is intended to produce a validated,
interoperable postoperative triage classification system, foundational evidence for generating continuous
streams of postoperative transfer and discharge recommendations, a postoperative triage decision support
system ready for clinical implementation, and open-source software for optimizing deep learning certainty and
fairness. Achieving these outcomes would increase the probability of success for automated, real-time
postoperative triage decision-support in subsequent clinical trials, and the ultimate goal of augmenting
personalized, patient-centered decision making in surgery."
10864973,"One strategy to enhance the immune response to tumors is radiotherapy (RT). Recent data support that RT-
induced micronuclei (MN) are intrinsically immunostimulatory, as ruptured MN releases double stranded DNA
(dsDNA) eliciting the cycling GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway.
Although progress has been made in combining immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with RT, relatively little is
known about the physical mechanisms of RT that elicit immunostimulatory signals and how they can be har-
nessed clinically in the context of DNA damage and DNA repair inhibition. Radiation with high ionization density
(or linear energy transfer, LET) induces more clustered DNA lesions, more MN and higher cell kill compared to
low-LET radiation. α-particles are characterized by their high-LET in contrast to photons and protons and may
be ideal for creating high levels of MN and downstream enhanced activation of immunostimulatory signals
through the cGAS-STING pathway. A novel modality to deliver α-particles has recently been successfully demon-
strated in a phase I clinical trial using a method called diffusing alpha-emitters radiation therapy (DaRT). DaRT
consists of interstitial radioactive seeds coated with radium-224, an α-particle emitter. The radium-224 decay
chain is unique in that the decay products also emit α-particles and diffuse, allowing the α-particles’ dose to be
deposited over 2-3 mm from the seed. Thus, multiple seeds implanted into a tumor allow the high-LET α-particle
dose to be deposited within the entire tumor volume. In addition to radiation, pharmacologic inhibition of DNA
repair affects the presence of MN. This inhibition of DNA repair can be created with drugs such as Ataxia telan-
giectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) inhibitors (ATRi). The combination of an ATRi with α-particle-induced clustered
DSB lesions may synergistically enhance the accumulation of MN, ultimately enhancing immunostimulatory sig-
nals. These will be investigated with ICB to determine how to synergistically augment RT-induced antitumor
immunity. We hypothesize that α-particles combined with an ATRi produces more MN, results in more cGAS
binding to dsDNA and consequently potentiate robust antitumor immunity. We propose to: 1) Elucidate the mech-
anisms by which cGAS binds to dsDNA in -particles+ATRi treated cells; 2) Elucidate the mechanisms by which
-particles+ATRi induces immune signaling; and 3) Evaluate antitumor immunity from -particles+ATRi in vivo.
Our research has the potential to define -particles as a tool to augment antitumor immune response, especially
for tumors that are known to be unresponsive to ICB. Our proposed research is of critical relevance to address
the poor prognosis associated with multiple advanced solid cancers that are immunologically cold. Our proposed
work is innovative, in that it aims to define the effects of -particle-induced clustered DNA damage on tumors in
the context of antitumor immunity. Our findings will elucidate the mechanisms behind immune modulation by
high-LET radiation, which may ultimately guide the combined rational use of modalities that use high-LET radi-
ation (including α-emitting radiopharmaceuticals), DNA repair inhibitors and ICB for aggressive cancers."
10896139,"ABSTRACT
Approximately 35% of children in the U.S. have overweight or obesity (OW/OB). To date, the most successful
weight loss program for children is Family-Based Treatment (FBT), which is delivered to both children and
parents and includes nutrition and physical activity education, behavior therapy techniques, and parenting
skills. Data suggest that 2/3 of children who participate in FBT do not respond. This lack of success suggests
that there are unaddressed mechanisms that could be impacting treatment response. The Behavioral
Susceptibility Theory purports that food cue responsiveness (FR) is the primary driver of eating onset, while
satiety responsiveness (SR) is the primary driver of eating offset. High FR is a risk factor that influences weight
loss maintenance among children who participate in FBT. We developed a new model for the treatment of
children with OW/OB, called Regulation of Cues (ROC), which is based on the Behavioral Susceptibility
Theory. The ROC program targets these mechanisms for overeating, by focusing on reducing FR and
increasing SR. We pilot tested the ROC model with children who overeat with OW/OB, and showed that the
ROC program is feasible, acceptable and is a promising treatment for children. The objective of this proposed
study is to further evaluate the ROC program among children with OW/OB who are high on FR and their
parents. We propose a multisite 4-arm randomized controlled trial at UC San Diego and University of
Minnesota that will compare ROC, FBT, ROC+ nutrition education and caloric restriction (ROC+) and a health
education comparator (HE) over 18 months. We will recruit and randomize 280 children with OW/OB who are
high on FR and their parents and will conduct assessments at baseline, throughout treatment, post-treatment,
and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate changes in child weight
(BMIz/%BMIp95) as well as overeating episodes among children enrolled in ROC, FBT, ROC+ and HE.
Secondary aim 1 will compare ROC, FBT, ROC+ and HE on child SR, FR, inhibition, and energy intake over
the course of the treatment and follow-up. Secondary aim 2 will compare ROC, FBT, ROC+ and HE on parent
outcomes, including weight loss (BMI), overeating episodes, satiety responsiveness, food cue responsiveness
inhibition, and energy intake over the course of treatment and follow-up. Finally, exploratory aim 1 will evaluate
effects of mediators (food cue responsiveness, satiety responsiveness, inhibition) and moderators (food cue
responsiveness, satiety responsiveness, demographics, baseline BMIz/%BMIp95/BMI) of treatment effects on
weight loss over time among children and parents. This study could provide a more durable weight loss
program for children with OW/OB and high FR and has the potential to change the paradigm of weight-loss
treatment for children. This study will also contribute to the study of basic appetitive mechanisms and food
intake and inform clinical decision making for children with OW/OB."

Psychosocial stress has a major impact on cardiovascular health. Over the last 5 years of this PPG, we have
identified tissue, cellular, and molecular pathways that connect nervous, immune, and vascular systems during
stress. In this renewal, we will focus on identifying specific nodes of communication that link brain regions with
the vessel wall during the progression of cardiovascular disease. We will broaden our studies to explore how
neuroimmune and neurovascular connections are altered in the context of different stress perceptions.
Specifically, we will first seek to identify brain circuits and peripheral pathways linking psychosocial stress with
cardiovascular disease and then elucidate how resilience vs susceptibility to social defeat stress shapes
communication between brain and periphery in cardiovascular disease and its resolution. We will build on
preliminary data showing that acute stress elicits a profound spatial reorganization of four major leukocyte
classes, characterized by a mass migration of lymphoid and myeloid cells known to be important in
cardiovascular disease and noting that there is important difference in atherosclerosis progression between
resilient and susceptible mice. We hypothesize that distinct brain regions dynamically regulate monocyte,
neutrophil, and lymphocyte function and spatial distribution, influencing the development, progression, and
complications of atherosclerosis and that one or more of these pathways is critical during social defeat stress.
We will use sophisticated approaches and models, including optogenetics and chemogenetics. Together, we
will elucidate the communication network linking the brain with the vasculature and atherosclerosis during
resilience and susceptibility to social stress."
10891381,"SUMMARY
Chronic psychosocial stress is a pervasive component of the human experience, carrying an attributable
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk that is on par with smoking or cardiometabolic disease (CMD). While a
“heart-brain connection” has long been postulated, the mechanisms underlying stress’s deleterious effects on
the cardiovascular system are largely under-investigated. In the previous grant cycle, we used cutting-edge
tools, including combined positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging, to gain
critical insights on the links between severe, acute psychosocial stress and altered neural, immune, and
cardiovascular functions in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients with low CVD risk. In the course of
this first Program Project, our landmark findings uncovered a stress-associated neuro-immune-cardiovascular
axis, which has now been validated by several other groups and proven to be a pervasive promoter of
cardiovascular diseases. As shown by our preliminary data, we also observed strong links between stress-
associated neural activity (SNA) and several CMD components, and we showed that genetics and lifestyle
factors can modulate the relationship between stress and CVD. However, critical knowledge gaps remain. We
need a better understanding of how stress-induced disruptions in neural networks lead to immune system
dysregulation, CMD and atherosclerosis. The mechanisms by which genetic and lifestyle factors impact the
neuro-immune-cardiovascular axis are also not well understood. Moreover, these processes need to be
studied in individuals at higher risk for cardiovascular disease, the same population that would stand to gain
the most from insights on how best to modulate this system to improve cardiovascular health. The
overarching hypothesis of Project 4 is that, in subjects with moderate-to-high risk for CVD: heightened SNA
(notably including the activity of the the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)) associates with
CMD, heightened immune system activity, and, ultimately, CVD manifestations. We hypothesize that this
stress-related neuro-immune-cardiovascular axis is modulated by genetic traits and health behaviors that are
known to associate with stress sensitivity. In the first aim of this Project, we will focus on characterizing stress-
related alterations in neurological networks that associate with CVD and CMD, in the context of genetic and
health behaviors. The second aim will characterize the stress-induced immune dysregulations that mediate
CVD. In summary, this study will provide critical insights into the connections between stress-induced
alterations in brain circuitry, immune dysregulations, and their downstream deleterious consequences on the
cardiovascular system in patients at moderate-to-high risk for CVD. By exploring the interactions among these
processes and other important CVD risk factors, such as cardiometabolic, genetic, and lifestyle factors, we will
be able to shed light on novel strategies to mitigate stress’s negative effects on the cardiovascular system."

 2 Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) like Kenya and Pakistan face a double burden
 3 of disease. This was escalated by the Covid-19 pandemic which enhanced inequity,
 4 exploitation and inaccessibility to research outputs. The Covid pandemic also diversified the
 5 research portfolio and Research Ethics Committees (RECs) in such settings grappled with
 6 uncertainty while providing oversight to novel research initiatives. The growing number of
 7 institutions of higher learning in Kenya and large number of institutions in Pakistan with both
 8 social sciences and biomedical faculties emphasize the need to enhance human subject
 9 protection and build capacity for both training and research in bioethics. To address current
10 and emerging ethical challenges, we propose diversification of the existing South to South
11 collaboration, between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the Centre for
12 Biomedical Ethics and Culture (CBEC). Building onto the work done in the past five years,
13 the CBEC-KEMRI Bioethics Training Initiative (CK-BTI) will establish the first blended
14 bioethics PGD and Masters level programs at 2 local Kenyan universities. To achieve
15 sustainability and to ensure the timely completion, CK-BTI will provide faculty for both
16 programs, and conduct training in ethics pedagogy including development of teaching and
17 examination tools while also providing training in mentorship. This will also a ensure a critical
18 mass of well-trained faculty for the two new Kenyan programs and spill over to support other
19 graduate level bioethics training programs which are currently being established in both
20 Kenya and Pakistan. Capacity building for other stakeholders including RECs members and
21 researchers in Kenya will be achieved by expanding the number of certificate courses
22 offered every year and introducing a new training to target lay members of REC. Rapid
23 capacity building initiatives including workshops in research ethics and research
24 methodology will also be introduced in Pakistan. Finally to support and grow leaders in
25 global bioethics in both countries, workshops to develop skills in grantsmanship and
26 publication will be held to expand bioethics research output. This contextual needs-driven
27 multi-pronged program ultimately seeks to enhance quality of research and enhance human
28 subject protection in resource-constrained settings."
10816466,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Profound changes in chromatin occur in aged cells and tissues. These changes, such as altered histone
modifications and chromatin conformation, lead to loss of heterochromatin, reduced nucleosome stability, and
aberrant transcription, all of which have been causally linked to the aging process. Using yeast strains with
reduced histone dosage, a model mimicking the situation of aged cells, we uncovered a cellular response to
such chromatin defects, named chromatin architectural defects (CAD) response or simply chromatin stress
response. Like cellular stress to heat and oxidation where moderate levels of stress can lead to hormesis, a
beneficial effect, activating CAD response with moderate chromatin defects extends lifespan, offering a new
intervention strategy to antagonize aging and age-related diseases. However, many mechanistic details of this
response remain unexplored. This project will focus on these mechanistic questions. Does the CAD response
directly mitigate age-associated chromatin changes and defects, such as disrupted heterochromatin, loss of
transcription silencing and cryptic transcription? TOR inhibition is critical for the longevity effect of CAD response.
How does the CAD response crosstalk with other TOR-related stress response pathways? In particular, does
the CAD response interact with Isw2-regulated longevity-promoting stress responses? How does CAD response
interact with metabolic changes? What are the regulators and effectors of CAD response? Importantly, how does
the previously identified CAD response transcription factor Gis1 function to activate the transcriptional response?
Addressing these questions pertaining to detailed molecular mechanisms will help characterize CAD response
with molecular regulators and effectors, physiological effects to the cell, and relationships with other stress
response and metabolic pathways. These mechanistic details will establish CAD response as a novel form of
stress response with hormetic effects that promote longevity."
10915407,"ABSTRACT. Stark disparities in cardiometabolic health outcomes exist by racialized identity and income level.
Low-income populations experience 40-70% higher risk for cardiovascular mortality compared to higher-income
populations. Black and Latinx populations experience higher rates of at-risk cardiovascular profiles compared to
White populations. Diet quality is hypothesized to play a key role in these disparities. But consuming a health-
promoting diet is out of reach for many Americans, and disproportionately so for low-income populations and
people of color. Structural and economic factors make high-quality diets out of reach for many. Specifically, the
intersecting experience of food insecurity, poverty, structural racism, precarious employment, high cost, and
difficult to access healthier foods creates a discriminatory and unjust context where accessing, purchasing, and
eating a health-promoting diet, particularly one high in fruits and vegetables, is unattainable. As a result,
interventions and policies that reduce these structural and economic barriers have high potential to improve food
security, dietary quality, and ultimately improve health. To this end, the federal government, several states, and
municipalities have introduced policy interventions that provide financial incentives to promote the purchase of
fruits and vegetables by low-income populations. However, several prominent design features of these programs
leave many of the structural causes of food insecurity and low fruit and vegetable consumption in place. In this
study, we can improve what is known about the equity and impact of fruit and vegetable incentive programs
through the study of Seattle's Fresh Bucks Program. This program has been designed with several features that
have the potential to overcome the limitations of previous programs. Methodologically, we propose a mixed
methods study that leverages randomized assignment for assessing causal impact, includes participatory
approaches and a sequential explanatory mixed methods design to assess equity in implementation, and a
quasi-experimental design to utilize electronic health records of program participants and a matched comparison
population to estimate associations with long-term (2-4 years) program enrollment and health outcomes in the
following Aims: 1) Determine the impact of Fresh Bucks on fruit and vegetable intake and food insecurity,
leveraging randomized program assignment for causal impacts. 2) Assess Fresh Bucks implementation equity
through redemption rates and experience. 3) Assess the impact of long-term access to Fresh Bucks on
cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure and BMI, in a cohort of recipients and family members with
matched electronic health records. Decreasing food insecurity and improving diet quality among low-income and
minoritized populations is of primary importance for policymakers concerned about reducing systemic barriers
to health. Upon completion of this work, we will have substantially advanced what is known about the dietary,
health and implementation equity impacts of fruit and vegetable incentive programs and the potential for these
policies to reduce systemic barriers to health."

African American women experience a high burden of cardiometabolic disease conditions. Fifty-seven percent
are obese, 57% have cardiovascular disease, and 12% have diagnosed diabetes. Engaging in regular aerobic
physical activity is an established mechanism to prevent and manage these cardiometabolic diseases. The
purpose of this study is test the efficacy of a culturally tailored, theory-based smartphone-delivered physical
activity intervention to increase physical activity, promote adherence to national aerobic physical activity
guidelines, and improve cardiometabolic disease risk factors among African American women. In a 12-month,
two arm randomized trial, 240 sedentary (i.e., < 60 minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical
activity) African American women with obesity (i.e., BMI >30 kg/m2) will be assigned to receive either Smart
Walk, a culturally tailored, Social Cognitive Theory-based physical activity promotion intervention (n=120), or a
Fitbit-only comparison arm (n=120). The Smart Walk intervention group will receive a culturally tailored
physical activity intervention delivered via the Smart Walk smartphone app, virtual physical activity coaching,
and text messages. Features available on the Smart Walk app include: 1) personal profile pages, 2) culturally
relevant multi-media (i.e., text and video) physical activity promotion modules, 3) message/discussion boards,
and 4) physical activity self-monitoring/tracking feature that integrates with Fitbit activity monitors for
participants to track their daily, weekly, and monthly activity. Virtual physical activity coaches will actively
engage and facilitate group-based dialogue among participants on the discussion boards and provide
individualized, one-on-one physical activity coaching via telephone or commercially available app-based video
teleconferencing software, based on participant preference. Smart Walk participants also receive three
physical activity promotion text messages each week for the duration of the active 4-month intervention. The
Fitbit-only arm comparison arm will receive a Fitbit activity monitor and be encouraged to use the commercially
available device to increase physical activity. We hypothesize participants in the Smart Walk intervention group
will demonstrate significantly greater improvements in physical activity and cardiometabolic risk factors when
compared to the Fitbit-only comparison group. Primary outcomes include self-reported and accelerometer-
measured changes in physical activity. Secondary outcomes include traditional risk factors for cardiometabolic
disease (i.e., BMI, blood pressure, serum lipid profiles, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance) and more novel
and prognostic risk factors, including cardiorespiratory fitness, aortic pulse wave velocity, pro-inflammatory
biomarkers of TNF-α, IL-6, and anti-inflammatory biomarkers of IL-10 and IL-15. We will also explore
mediators and moderators of intervention effectiveness and determine the total societal cost per participant of
delivering the Smart Walk intervention and the cost-effectiveness of the two study groups to increase
minutes/week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity."
10877922,"ABSTRACT
Iron is essential for cellular growth due to its role as a cofactor in proteins involved in DNA synthesis,
mitochondrial respiration and hemoglobin production. Vertebrate iron metabolism is controlled post-
transcriptionally by iron-regulatory protein 2 (Irp2). Irp2 binds to iron-responsive elements (IREs) in the mRNAs
of proteins involved in iron uptake (transferrin receptor 1), sequestration (ferritin) and export (ferroportin), and
regulates the translation or stability of these mRNAs. During iron deficiency, Irp2 binds IREs to regulate mRNA
translation or stability, whereas during iron sufficiency, Irp2 is degraded by the FBXL5-SCF ubiquitin ligase.
Here we show that Irp2 is regulated by iron-independent phosphorylation of Ser157 during G2/M that disrupts
its interaction with ferritin IRE mRNA during mitosis and depresses ferritin translation. Expression of Irp2-S157A
in Irp2KO-MEFs causes a G2/M delay and slows proliferation. The significance of S157 phosphorylation was
investigated in mice where Ser157 was mutated to Ala157 (Irp2A/A)). Irp2A/A mice exhibit macrocytic anemia,
defective erythroid terminal differentiation, splenomegaly, and dysregulated systemic iron metabolism. We
propose that cell-cycle regulation of ferritin and other IRE-mRNAs may provide a mechanism to modulate the
cellular labile iron pool during the cell cycle. Our overall goal is to determine how loss of S157 phosphorylation
perturbs erythropoiesis and causes anemia. Our aims are to 1) determine the cell-autonomous role for Irp2-
S157 phosphorylation in erythropoiesis by bone marrow (BM) transplantation and flow cytometric analysis of
cell-cycle status, proliferation, iron and other parameters, 2) identify mechanisms underlying dysregulated
erythropoiesis in Irp2A/A mice using a mouse erythroblast in vitro differentiation system with WT and Irp2A/A BM
cells, and proteomic analysis of erythroblast populations to identify protein changes between WT and Irp2A/A
cells, and 3) generate an erythroid-specific Irp2A/A knockin mouse model to study erythroid terminal
differentiation. We anticipate that our studies will provide new insights of normal and dysregulated
erythropoiesis."

trained immunity in the context of transplantation. To safeguard the appropriate implementation of trained
immunity assays across the different projects, we have established a Mechanistic and Bioinformatics Core
(Core C). Core C will operate at Mount Sinai and be directed by Dr. Jordi Ochando, an internationally
recognized transplant immunologist and one of the founders of trained immunity in organ transplantation

biologically validate promising therapeutic targets. Importantly, this Core will also safeguard bioinformatics and
biostatistics analyses and general data management and storage. Lastly, Core C will implement and manage
Labguru, a laboratory management system used to track samples, record, and share protocols and data, and

10851848,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Historically, organ transplant immunologists have focused on the adaptive immune system, as organ rejection is
mediated primarily by T cells. However, accumulating evidence indicates a distinct role for innate immune cells
in the complex graft-reactive immune response. This P01’s investigators propose to modulate innate immune
responses by targeting trained immunity, a long-term increase in the functional responsiveness of innate immune
cells, which is maintained by epigenetic modifications and can be considered de facto innate immune memory.
The members of Project 1 recently demonstrated in a mouse model of heart allograft transplantation that graft
rejection can be prevented by therapeutically regulating trained immunity. Suppressing trained immunity yielded
a tolerogenic milieu characterized by an accumulation of regulatory macrophages and regulatory T cells in the
allograft. This change in the allograft microenvironment resulted in long-term graft survival without requiring
immunosuppressive therapy. These results are corroborated by preliminary data in kidney transplant patients,
showing that trained immunity is associated with 10-year graft survival. Based on these preclinical and clinical
preliminary data, Project 1’s overall hypothesis is that trained immunity promotes graft rejection in kidney
transplant patients.
In Aim 1, we will study which circulating factors (e.g., danger-associated molecular patterns and proinflammatory
cytokines) are produced as a result of ischemia-reperfusion injury during transplantation and how these impact
graft survival by inducing trained immunity. Durable trained immunity requires epigenetic changes in bone
marrow myeloid progenitors. In Aim 2, we will investigate how changes in the bone marrow influence the
production and behavior of circulating monocytes and relate this to clinical outcomes, including graft survival.
To accomplish these Aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators led by Project Lead Dr.
Mulder, who will coordinate Project 1 and supervise a team of experienced co-Is: Dr. Duivenvoorden is a
transplant nephrologist and will be responsible for the studies on kidney transplant patients, Drs. Mhlanga and
Netea will be responsible for all RNA- and ATAC-sequencing in close collaboration with Core C.
Project 1 will yield critical insights into the relation between trained immunity and graft survival in kidney
transplant patients. These insights will open new diagnostic and therapeutic avenues for advancing patient care."
10851853,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
Transplantation has revolutionized the lives of patients suffering from organ failure. However, the associated
immunosuppressive therapies induce significant side effects and display suboptimal success rates. Achieving a
state of operational tolerance would lead to indefinite graft survival without chronic immunosuppression and its
associated morbidity. This P01’s investigators have revealed pronounced organ-specific differences in
tolerance induction, preserved across species. For example, kidney and liver allografts are easier to tolerize
than heart and lung allografts. Moreover, co-transplanting a kidney promotes tolerance of heart allografts. These
phenomena indicate an underappreciated mechanism regulating allograft tolerance, which might be
therapeutically leveraged to turn “tolerant resistant” into “tolerance prone” organs.
This P01’s investigators have also demonstrated that trained immunity plays a critical role in allograft
rejection. Trained immunity is a long-term (>several months) increased functional responsiveness of innate
immune cells mediated through epigenetic mechanisms at the level of hematopoietic progenitors in the bone
marrow, resulting in enhanced production of hyperresponsive myeloid cells. We demonstrated that
transplantation induces trained immunity and that the ensuing ‘trained’ myeloid cells promote graft rejection.
Project 2’s premise is 1) that the difference between organs’ susceptibility to acute rejection stems from
different degrees or modes of trained immunity of trained immunity and that 2) therapeutically inhibiting
trained immunity early post-transplantation will prolong graft survival. In line with this, we have developed
bone marrow-avid nanotherapeutics which inhibit the trained immunity regulator mTOR and effectively promote
allograft survival without continuous immunosuppressive therapy.
Here, we propose studying and therapeutically inhibiting trained immunity in mouse transplant models. Aim 1
will longitudinally assess the (innate) immune response to rejecting heart and spontaneously accepting kidney
transplantation, using in vivo immuno-PET imaging and ex vivo (multi-omics) analyses. We will strive to maximize
the obtained mechanistic insights using relevant knockout models and syngeneic controls. In parallel, Aim 2 will
therapeutically inhibit trained immunity-related metabolic and epigenetic pathways and similarly study the effects
on the immune system and graft survival.
This Project will unravel the mechanisms behind transplantation-induced trained immunity and its role in graft
rejection. Furthermore, it will advance an innovative treatment paradigm based on trained immunity-regulating
nanobiologics and initiate clinically relevant readouts of trained immunity based on immuno-PET imaging.
Project 2, led by Dr. Teunissen, will interface with Projects 1 and 3 by providing mechanistic insights and
validating novel therapeutic targets."
10851860,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Kidney allograft tolerance has been achieved in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and humans by combining
nonmyeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation resulting in transient mixed hematopoietic
chimerism. However, identical protocols have failed to induce tolerance in NHP heart recipients. The reason for
this immunological dichotomy is unknown but elucidating its underlying mechanisms could inform new strategies
for achieving tolerance of resistant allografts (Aim 1). Despite the immune barriers posed by heart allografts, we
have recently developed a novel protocol that has, for the first time, induced long-term tolerance of fully MHC
mismatched heart allografts in cynomolgus monkeys. We attained this remarkable result by combining a
transient mixed chimerism protocol with donor kidney co-transplantation. The presence of the donor kidney was
associated with diminished inflammation and enhanced host regulatory mechanisms. Since sacrificing a kidney
allograft simply to achieve tolerance in human heart recipients is untenable, we now seek an effective substitute
for kidney co-transplantation (Aim 2). Recently, our team reported that following organ transplantation,
macrophages in the allograft display distinct epigenetic signatures associated with the functional state of trained
immunity. Trained immunity has been identified as de facto innate immune memory characterized by metabolic
and epigenetic changes in innate immune cells, resulting in their hyperresponsiveness. Trained macrophages
have heightened inflammatory cytokine responses and upregulated costimulatory molecules, which
consequently induce more potent adaptive immune responses. Importantly, our team has designed a myeloid
cell-specific nanoimmunotherapy that selectively inhibits trained immunity while promoting regulatory
mechanisms and has achieved long-term cardiac allograft survival in mice and, more recently, in monkeys.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that 1) trained immunity contributes to the tolerance resistance of heart
versus kidney allografts, and 2) trained immunity-inhibiting nanotherapy will generate an anti-inflammatory/pro-
regulatory milieu that will facilitate heart tolerance without the need for kidney co-transplantation. We will test
these hypotheses in Project 3. Murine studies in Project 2 will guide Project 3 by providing complementary, in-
depth mechanistic analyses of trained immunity in heart and kidney recipients and also identifying new trained
immunity-inhibiting targets (developed by Core B) worthy of testing in NHPs. Core C will provide state-of-the-art
molecular assays and expertise, to determine mechanistically 1) how trained immunity is induced, 2) the role
trained immunity plays in the organ-specific differences observed in tolerance induction, and 3) how our therapies
impact trained immunity. We anticipate that together, these highly interactive Projects will generate new and
innovative therapeutic strategies to prevent rejection and more effectively achieve immune tolerance. If
successful, these studies could impact the entire field of transplantation and provide insights that could also be
field-changing for bone marrow transplantation and autoimmune disease."
10640316,"Syphilis remains a public health threat worldwide, with an estimated 11 million new infections per year and
a global burden of 36 million infections. Within the last decade there have been outbreaks of syphilis
cases in major cities around the world, including within the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and
China. In 2019 the number of syphilis cases within the United States doubled over the previous five year
period, while the number of congenital syphilis cases quadrupled ove r the same time period. Although
syphilis is curable with penicillin treatment if diagnosed early, the worldwide syphilis prevalence shows
that elimination of this disease will not occur through public health control measures alone, and instead
willrequire development of effective strategies to prevent infection with this pathogen. Development of
such infection prevention strategies requires an in depth knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms used
by this highly successful pathogen. The bacterium that causes syphilis, Treponema pallidum, is able to
disseminate rapidly within the host during the early stages of infection to infect every organ and tissue.
Minimal understanding exists surrounding the pathogenic mechanisms used by T. pal lidum to undergo
widespread dissemination throughout the host, and gaining understanding within this highly relevant area
of study will reveal novel approaches to disease prevention.
The long-term objective of the current research project is to increase understanding of the pathogenic
mechanisms used by T. pallidum to disseminate via the bloodstream and cause disease. To accomplish
this objective, the following specific aims are proposed: (1) Determination of the host cell signaling
pathways engaged by T. pallidum to facilitate treponemal dissemination across cell barriers, manipulation
of host cell responses, and immune evasion; (2) Identification of T. pal lidum proteins responsible for
manipulation of the host cell response; and (3) In vivo assessment of the role of the prioritized T. pallidum
proteins in disease pathogenesis. These studies will increase understanding of the critical processes of
T. pallidum dissemination and immune evasion. Further, they are expected to reveal novel pathogenic
strategies for host cell signaling subversion and immune response alteration by T. pallidum which enables
crossing of cellular barriers, accessing of deeper tissues within the host, and evasion of the immune
response.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Syphilis infections continue to be prevalent worldwide, with an estimated global burden of 36 million cases
and recent outbreaks observed in North America, Europe and Asia. The bacterium that causes syphilis is
one of the most invasive organisms known, and this research investigates how the bacterium is able to
spread so widely and rapidly within the host. This research will increase understanding of how the
bacterium causes infection and will allow development of strategies to prevent syphilis infection.

10833167,"ABSTRACT. Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of persistent, ubiquitous, and endocrine
disrupting synthetic chemicals commonly used in consumer products and industrial processes. While they are
detected in >97% of the US population, residents of low-income communities and racial-ethnic minorities show
greater concentrations of many PFAS substances. Experimental and animal data support PFAS as potential
mammary carcinogens. Epidemiologic data have been mixed, but results from a limited number of prospective
studies among primarily European white women suggest that several PFAS compounds are associated with
increased risk of breast cancer and that metabolic alterations linked to PFAS might underlie the associations.
However, no prospective data from diverse racial-ethnic populations are available. The primary goal of this study
is to investigate whether higher PFAS exposure increases the risk of breast cancer in a diverse US population
and whether integration of PFAS levels, metabolic alterations, genetic predisposition, and epidemiologic risk
factors of breast cancer identifies subgroups of women at increased risk. We propose the first and largest
prospective multi-ethnic study to examine PFAS as novel risk factors of breast cancer. Leveraging the pre-
diagnostic blood samples and comprehensive data on breast cancer risk factors and genomics in the Multiethnic
Cohort (MEC), an ethnically diverse prospective cohort in California and Hawaii, we propose a nested case-
control study of 1,600 female invasive breast cancer patients and 1,600 matched control women (12% African
American, 16% Latina, 11% Native Hawaiian, 40% Asian American, and 21% White). We will utilize state-of-the-
art laboratory technologies based on untargeted liquid chromatography with high resolution mass spectrometry
to measure plasma PFAS and metabolome profiles, and combine these comprehensive measurements with
innovative statistical methods to evaluate the integrated associations of PFAS, metabolome, genetics, risk
factors, and breast cancer risk. Our specific aims are: (1) To examine the association between pre-diagnostic
plasma levels of PFAS and risk of invasive breast cancer; (1a) Evaluate the associations of individual PFAS and
PFAS mixture in pre-diagnostic plasma samples with breast cancer risk; (1b) Examine whether genetic
predisposition determined by a polygenic risk score (PRS) modifies the association of individual PFAS and the
PFAS mixture with breast cancer risk; (2) To examine the association between pre-diagnostic metabolomic
profiles (a) with PFAS exposures and (b) with invasive breast cancer risk; (3) To integrate PFAS concentrations,
metabolomic measures, PRS, and other breast cancer risk factors to identify subgroups of women at increased
risk for breast cancer using an innovative latent variable analysis. This research relies on a multidisciplinary team
of internationally-recognized investigators with expertise in environmental and cancer epidemiology, and state-
of-the-art high-resolution metabolomics, genomics and statistical methods. Findings have the potential to inform
precision medicine approaches for breast cancer prevention for diverse populations, and to impact policy change."
10868635,"Summary
The COVID19 pandemic may take 1-3 years and only fully subside once we reach herd immunity. Given
the high mortality of COVID19, it is of critical importance to reach herd immunity through a vaccine. The
viral spike glycoprotein (S) is central to our efforts for developing an effective vaccine immunogen. The S
protein mediates viral entry into susceptible cells, is the primary target for antibodies, and is a widely
used antigen in diagnostic kits. As such understanding the structure and dynamics of the S protein, and
how antibodies engage it, is important to our response to COVID19. S consists of a trimer of S1/S2
dimers. S1 contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that interacts with receptor ACE2. S2 is further
processed by proteases into S2' that mediates fusion. Structural insights into the S protein have been
gained by single particle cryo electron microscopy (SP cryoEM) of a soluble trimer comprising most of the
ectodomain, as well as by cryo electron tomography (cryoET) and SP cryoEM of native virus particles.
These structural studies have revealed several distinct conformational prefusion states wherein the RBD
domain points either up or down. Receptor ACE2 binds the RBD in the up conformation and stabilizes S
in the `two-RBD-up' or `three-RBD-up' conformations. The observations of several distinct conformations
at the EM level suggest that the S trimer exists in a conformational equilibrium. Real-time measurements
of conformational dynamics of the S protein have not been performed. Many antibodies that bind and
neutralize the S protein are being isolated from single B cells from recovered patients, or generated in
mice, and their epitopes are being structurally characterized. Surprisingly, even though many antibodies
clearly bind SARS-CoV-2 S, many do not neutralize the virus. Vaccine studies and clinical trials based on
soluble RBD and S immunogens are under way. In general, they elicit antibodies and can protect from
challenge in non-human primates and underscore our hope that a vaccine that develops antibodies
against the S protein will be successful. However, the observation of non-neutralizing antibodies, a
decline of antibodies in patients and worrisome evidence that antibody-bound coronavirus particles are
responsible for the tissue-damaging inflammatory response seen in patients indicate that we need to
know more about antibody mediated immunity against SARS-CoV-2. To address these challenges, the
Mothes, Liu, Xiong and Blanchard laboratories will employ single molecule and in vivo imaging
techniques to determine the structure and dynamics of ligand-free and antibody-bound SARS-CoV-2 S
protein in the context of virus particles, and determine the fate of antibody-bound virus in vivo. Our work
will inform active and passive immunization strategies against the COVID19 pandemic."
10872327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is
the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the
bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in
treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days
a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many
injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at
hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in
treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel
underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate
in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a
result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term
objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1)
understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries;
2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of
treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized
in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying
modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to
quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite
transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will
ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the
right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the
same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed
training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned
and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design.
The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in
order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals."
10863854,"Project Summary / Abstract
Periodic paralysis and myotonia are ion channelopathies of skeletal muscle with debilitating episodes of severe
weakness lasting hours to days and activity-dependent muscle stiffness. The long-term goal of this project is to
advance our understanding of disease mechanism in these disorders of muscle excitability and to apply this
knowledge in the design and pre-clinical testing of therapeutic interventions.
 Much progress has been made in establishing a causal relationship between the biophysical defect of a
mutant channel and the clinical phenotype. For example, over 80 missense mutations have been identified in
the NaV1.4 sodium channel, and we have shown by functional expression studies, coupled with simulations of
fiber excitability, that mutations with gain of function changes (e.g. impaired inactivation) cause hyperkalemic
periodic paralysis (HyperPP) with myotonia. Alternatively, the NaV1.4 mutations in hypokalemic periodic
paralysis (HypoPP) are all R/X substitutions in S4 segments of voltage sensor domains that share a common
functional defect - the anomalous gating pore leakage current. In all forms of periodic paralysis, the transient
attacks of weakness result from sustained depolarization of 𝑉𝑟𝑒௦௧ and loss of excitability, which are often triggered
by stress, diet (carbohydrate, salt content, fasting), cold temperature, or exercise. The mechanisms by which
these triggers destabilize 𝑉𝑟𝑒௦௧, in the setting of a static defect for a mutant channel, are fundamental open
questions in the field and also represent opportunities for therapeutic intervention. A major impediment to
progress has been the scarce availability of affected muscle. We created three knock-in mutant mouse models
of PP that have robust phenotypes for HyperPP (NaV1.4-M1592V) or HypoPP (NaV1.4-R669H; CaV1.1-R528H).
These mouse models have led to new insights on disease mechanism (e.g. recovery from acidosis is a potent
trigger of HypoPP) and have led to novel therapeutic interventions that are now in clinical trials (bumetanide
inhibition of the NKCC1 cotransporter prevents HypoPP).
 We will extend our investigations of periodic paralysis by focusing on the impact of ion gradients.
Changes in extracellular [K+]o are established triggers for HypoPP (low) or HyperPP (high), but relatively little is
known about Na+ and Cl- shifts in PP. Limited human data suggest an acute rise of [Na+]in during an episode of
HyperPP or chronically high [Na+]in for HypoPP. In addition, we showed that reducing Cl- influx completely
prevents HypoPP attacks. We have developed improved ion-selective microelectrodes, that in combination with
the unique resource of our knock-in mutant mice, will enable us to (1) characterize muscle fiber Na+ and Cl-
content at rest and during an attack of PP, (2) define the contribution of specific ion transport systems (mutant
NaV1.4, NKCC1, Na/K-ATPase, Cl- exchangers) in setting ion concentrations in muscle channelopathies, (3)
define the functional consequences of ion gradient perturbations in PP, based on computational modeling and
simulation, and (4) use these insights in the design and pre-clinical testing of disease-modifying interventions.

Program has been extremely successful, attracting 151 Scholars who have authored >5200 publications, have
been PIs on 258 NIH grants, and have received a total of $557 million in grant funding. Remarkably, 99% of
our KL2 Scholars have attained positions in academia, industry or public health conducting, and often with
leadership responsibilities for, clinical and translational research. We aim to build on this success by providing
Scholars with individualized, competency-based training in translational research that prepares them to
contribute to the learning healthcare system, to advance personalized health, and to address health disparities.
This preparation includes training in clinical trials, big data, machine learning, bioinformatics, multidisciplinary
translational research, team science, implementation science and community-based participatory research. It
also introduces them to regulatory issues, bioethics, Good Clinical Practices, and factors that drive rigor,
transparency, and replicability. The KL2 promotes the development of relevant competencies among the
Scholars by providing: 1) opportunities to work successfully in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research
teams, 2) access to mentorship by senior mentors and recent Clinical Scholars, 3) externships in industry,
public health and regulatory agencies, and 4) intensive training in grant-writing and in multidisciplinary team
science. To oversee these diverse, highly motivated junior investigators, we have an educational leadership
team of: 1) three outstanding investigator mentors who work in different areas of translational research, 2) an
experienced Diversity Officer, and 3) an expert in evaluating and dynamically reshaping medical education
programs. This leadership team has used feedback from prior Scholars and their mentors to add new initiatives
to the already successful program. We expanded our logic model to implement social network analyses to
track the activities of the Scholars, and we will expand the curriculum to include a new course. That course will
mix Scholars and TL-1 trainees who will work in teams as they get formal training and peer mentoring in a
variety of areas such as big data/machine learning, diversity and inclusion, and running a research laboratory.
With these additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars
Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of leaders in T1-T4 translational research who
will transform healthcare in ways that alleviate the burden of disease and improve health in the US and around
the world. The Specific Aims of the KL2 are:
Aim 1: The Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program: To provide a program comprised of a mentored
research experience, coursework, and seminars that are intended to promote the emergence of scientific
independence and the career development of talented young T1-T4 translational scientist Scholars.

10817047,"Caveolins are a family of unusual membrane proteins that function as key regulators of the cardiovascular
system and metabolism. One of their major biological activities is to shape the plasma membrane to form
flask-shaped invaginations called caveolae. Defects in caveolins and caveolae have dramatic physiological
consequences and disrupt intracellular trafficking, signaling, lipid homeostasis, mechanosensing, and plasma
membrane integrity at the cellular level. How caveolins and caveolae regulate so many different cellular
functions has remained a mystery for nearly 30 years, in part due to the lack of information about the structure
of caveolins. Excitingly, the status quo recently changed. Using cryo-electron microscopy, we have now
determined the first high-resolution structure of the caveolin family member responsible for caveolae
biogenesis outside of muscle, caveolin-1 (CAV1). Consisting of 11 tightly packed protomers arranged in a
disc, the structure represents an oligomeric state of the protein that serves as the fundamental building block of
caveolae. It is thus now possible to begin to address how caveolae form and function at a mechanistic level.
Here, we propose to build on lessons learned from determining the structure of CAV1 to tackle another
ongoing conundrum in the field. Either as a consequence of disease-associated mutations or as a result of
natural selection, some caveolins are unable to generate caveolae on their own. Remarkably, these “non-
conventional” caveolins can still have profound effects on caveolae assembly and dynamics and even exert
distinct biological functions. How does this happen? To gain insight into this long-standing question, we
propose to compare and contrast the properties of CAV1 with caveolin-2 (CAV2), an evolutionarily conserved,
naturally occurring example of a caveolin that can only form caveolae in the presence of CAV1 and is required
for normal physiological function of the lung. Using a combination of structural, biochemical, biophysical,
computational, and cell biological assays, we will 1) determine how the unique structural features of CAV2
dictate its interactions with itself, CAV1, and other proteins and 2) study mechanisms used by caveolin
complexes to associate with and bend membranes and mediate plasma membrane homeostasis. These
studies will provide critical insights into how caveolins interact with themselves and one another to form the
building blocks of caveolae as well as how the distinct structural features of caveolin family members dictate
their biological functions by controlling their repertoire of interacting proteins and lipids. On a more
fundamental level, the proposed investigations will test new ideas about how proteins insert into membranes
and how this influences their ability to mold membrane morphology, composition, and function."

Acute pancreatitis causes nearly 300,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States, and its rates are rising.
One-third of cases are classified as having unknown cause, leaving patients vulnerable to repeated episodes
because they do not know how to alter their lifestyles. Unexpected side effects of prescription medications may
be responsible for acute pancreatitis cases with unknown cause. This situation is called drug-induced
pancreatic injury (DIPI). Unfortunately, healthcare providers and medical researchers do not know which
medications cause DIPI. This is because the majority of research about DIPI comes from descriptions of the
experience of individual patients. While these are valuable for providing clues about medications that might
cause DIPI, they do not account for other factors that could contribute to acute pancreatitis. Therefore,
conclusions from this type of study may falsely label particular medications as dangerous. This may lead to
reduced use of medications that are effective for the conditions that they treat, resulting in worse outcomes for
patients. There is a critical need to determine which medications do and do not cause DIPI in order to prevent
cases of acute pancreatitis and to continue patients on safe essential medications. The recent availability of
electronic databases with health information and powerful computer processing has made it possible to study
the effects of thousands of medications. Additionally, a new data analysis technique called pharmacopeia-wide
association studies (PWAS) has improved the efficiency of these studies. Furthermore, PWAS can be
combined with fundamental epidemiology principles to determine whether a study finding demonstrating a
medication side effect is true or false. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify medications that cause
DIPI by applying PWAS to two large databases of patient health information. Additionally, this proposal will
combine PWAS with a research framework called the Bradford Hill criteria to distinguish medications that
cause DIPI from false results. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) To identify medications that are
strongly associated with DIPI, demonstrate dose response, and exhibit biologic plausibility by applying the
PWAS framework to case-control studies; (2) To identify medications that demonstrate consistent temporality
and specificity with DIPI through novel applications of the PWAS framework; (3) To identify replicable
medication-DIPI associations by repeating Aims 1 and 2 using a second database; and (4) To develop and
disseminate an interactive database to integrate the study findings for clinicians and investigators. This
research is significant because it will improve patient outcomes by resolving clinical uncertainty about which
medications should be stopped after acute pancreatitis and which essential medications are safe to continue.
This research is innovative because it combines cutting-edge data analysis techniques with fundamental
research principles to comprehensively identify medications that cause DIPI. These techniques will be applied
to future studies that aim to identify medications that contribute to other medical conditions."

Approximately 34.1 million (13%) adults in the US have type 2 diabetes (T2D). The prevalence of T2D is 17%
higher in rural dwellers compared to their urban counterparts, and the prevalence of T2D increases with age,
with an estimated 25% of older adults (≥ 65 years) diagnosed. Appropriate self-care is necessary for optimal
clinical outcomes, and variability in self-care accounts for 90% of the variance in glycemic control. Overall, T2D
self-care is consistently poor among the general population but is even worse in rural-dwellers and older adults.
This is particularly true in rural Kentucky, where up to 23% of adults in Appalachian communities have been
diagnosed with T2D and, of those, 26.8% are older adults. To attain optimal clinical outcomes, social
environmental factors, including social support, are integral when promoting T2D self-care. Specifically, peer
support has shown to be efficacious in improving T2D self-care behaviors; it provides emotional support,
instrumental support, and education while also helping individuals develop new skills. Similarly, peer support has
also been shown to improve clinical and psychosocial outcomes related to T2D; however, there is literature that
also suggests self-selected social support can be obstructive when trying to engage in healthful activities.
Currently available evidence-based interventions (EBIs) using peer support have not been used specifically to
prioritize older adults, especially those living in rural communities. To address this gap in research, we have
conducted formative research with regional practitioners, leaders of service organizations in Appalachia, and
residents, and through that process, we collaboratively identified an acceptable and feasible peer support EBI—
peer health coaching (PHC)—that has resulted in improved clinical and psychosocial T2D-related outcomes
among participants who did not reside in rural communities nor were ≥65 years. Through these community
conversations, we also determined necessary a priori adaptations to the EBI to ensure its cultural and contextual
relevance to regional needs and values. Because PHC is a community-based and low-cost intervention, it holds
promise to be a sustainable and scalable model across Appalachian Kentucky where resources are often scant,
but community bonds are valued. Informed by literature and feedback from stakeholders, the goal of the
proposed study is to use a 2x2 factorial design to test the adapted PHC components and determine their
preliminary effectiveness to promote self-care behaviors and improve glycemic control among older adults living
in Appalachian Kentucky. The main components of the factorial design will be how peer coaches are selected
for participants (self-selected vs matched) and frequency of contact with coach (once per week vs every 2
weeks). To achieve this goal, we will (1) determine which EBI components are associated with improved T2D-
related outcomes in older adults living in Appalachia Kentucky and (2) evaluate the pragmatic implementability
of the adapted EBI."
10817052,"Helminth infections and allergic diseases impact billions of individuals worldwide. While induction of type 2
immune responses are necessary for combatting helminth pathogens, inappropriate type 2 immunity triggers
inflammatory and allergic conditions. Therefore, improved understanding of mechanisms that control type 2
immune responses are needed. The intestinal microbiota continually influence immune responses, and several
studies have demonstrated that microbiota-derived factors dampen type 2 immunity. Intestinal tuft cells are
specialized epithelial cells that are essential for sensing luminal signals and initiating downstream type 2 immune
responses. My preliminary data indicate that the microbiota regulate tuft cell homeostasis and tuft cell-dependent
type 2 immune responses in the intestine. Studies outlined in this proposal will directly test (i) how intestinal stem
cells instruct tuft cell differentiation, and (ii) how commensal bacteria impact tuft cell-dependent type 2 immunity.
Collectively, these studies will provide new insights into how the microbiota direct intestinal epithelial
differentiation to instruct intestinal immune responses, and will guide novel microbiota-based approaches for
investigating and treating type 2-driven intestinal diseases.
My career goal is to establish myself as a successful investigator studying microbiota-regulated intestinal
diseases. To progress towards this goal, I propose in this application to dissect interactions between the
microbiota, epithelial cell differentiation, and mucosal immune responses. I will specifically concentrate on
developing expertise in four new areas that will facilitate my transition to independence: 1) gnotobiotics and
metagenomics, 2) type 2-driven murine disease models, 3) epithelial development and human intestinal
organoids, and 4) chromatin and single cell analyses. My mentors, Dr. Alenghat and Dr. Wells, along with the
exceptional scientific and intellectual environment at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital will enable me to utilize
modern, innovative approaches in my research and collaborate with top investigators. Over the next five years,
I fully anticipate that my background, in conjunction with the career development plan outlined in my application,
will allow me to successfully carry out the proposed project. The mentoring and training I will receive will enable
me to successfully transition to an independent research career directed towards fundamental advances in
intestinal immunity, as well as innovative and targeted strategies for investigating microbiota-sensitive diseases."
10857032,"Abstract
Involuntary commitment (IVC)—also known as involuntary civil commitment or civil commitment—is a legal
procedure in which a person thought to be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others is mandated by the
courts to receive treatment for serious mental illness or substance use. The process typically starts when
interested parties—often family members, medical personnel, or law enforcement (LE)—petition the court to
issue an order for treatment. If the person of concern is not already in medical care, LE will apprehend the
person in the community (which we refer to as LE-IVC) and transport to a local emergency department for
evaluation. If medical personnel deem that the person is indeed at risk for harm to self or others, mandatory
treatment is initiated. For those initiating LE-IVCs, the mechanism may be viewed as a ‘last resort’ in protecting
individual and public safety. At the same time, the extreme nature of LE-IVCs—apprehending people from the
community, depriving them of their autonomy, and forcing them to receive treatment—raises ethical and practical
questions about the government’s role in peoples’ lives; patients’ post-IVC perceptions of treatment, treatment
providers, and law enforcement; and the impact of IVC on risk of self-harm, overdose, and harming others. These
issues take on added complexity within the context of historic and ongoing racial discrimination and inequalities
in the US South, including the sometimes fraught relationships between Black persons and both the medical
community and law enforcement. Further, the high profile incidents of Black people killed by police has raised
concerns that they may be at particular risk for injury when being apprehended for a LE-IVC. Nevertheless, much
remains unknown about racial differences in the use and relative effectiveness of LE-IVCs. In response, we
propose to assess differences in the incidence, outcomes, and experiences of LE-IVCs across racial groups,
focusing primarily on Black-White differences. In North Carolina, a large southern state, we will link statewide
data (2017-2022) for emergency department visits, inpatient hospital stays, arrests and deaths, as well as gather
qualitative interview data to accomplish the following aims: 1) To describe statewide trends in LE-IVCs by race
and other socio-demographic and community characteristics; 2) To examine racial disparities in risk of overdose,
self-harm, and perpetrating assaults following a LE-IVC; 3) To explore Black and White patients’ and family
members’ perspectives on LE-IVCs. The role of LE-IVCs in perpetuating racial disparities remains largely
unaddressed. Our research will inform public health leaders, behavioral health practitioners, law enforcement,
and patient groups about the use and consequences of LE-IVCs and its possible role impacting racial disparities
in health care access and outcomes. Our study findings will also inform ongoing public discussions about
balancing public health interventions with individual autonomy in the context of racial disparities. More pointedly,
findings will contribute to debates regarding whether and how law enforcement should participate in behavioral
health interventions."

Melanoma is the most lethal of skin cancers, with progression to local invasion and metastasis leading to poor
patient outcomes, highlighting the need for better understanding of melanoma progression. During melanoma
progression, tumorigenic cells must overcome growth restraints imposed by the microenvironmental
keratinocytes. Although much is known of keratinocyte regulatory controls on normal melanocytes, less is known
about their interactions in melanoma. Our preliminary data suggests that melanoma induces an epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) program in adjacent keratinocytes In Aim 1, I will investigate the role of
keratinocyte EMT on melanoma initiation. For this study, I will use the zebrafish as an animal model to study
in vivo interactions between keratinocytes and melanoma cells. I will induce spontaneous melanoma formation
in transgenic zebrafish lines with GFP labeled keratinocytes and use imaging to confirm morphological changes
indicative of EMT in tumor-associated keratinocytes (TAKs). Then, I will assess them for EMT transcription factor
and adhesion protein changes. We hypothesize that melanoma-induction of keratinocyte EMT will result in loss
of keratinocyte regulation on melanoma proliferation. We will test this hypothesis by knocking out EMT
transcription factors in keratinocytes and assess effects on melanoma initiation and proliferation in the zebrafish
model. In addition, our preliminary data has also highlighted an upregulation of paracrine signals from TAKs
involved in melanoma migration and invasion. In Aim 2, I will determine how keratinocyte-derived secreted
factors affect migration and invasion of nascent melanoma. To study migration of melanoma in vivo, I will
first optimize existing imaging pipelines in our lab to quantitatively to track cell migration by imaging of the
zebrafish skin. I can then assess the effect of knocking out keratinocyte-derived factors such as endothelin,
Wnt5A and BDNF using cell-type specific CRISPR-editing to determine their effects on migration. We
hypothesize that given the migratory role of these paracrine factors from in vitro data, we will see reduced
melanoma migration and invasion into adjacent tissues on migration tracking and histology by knocking-out these
factors in keratinocytes. By characterizing the role of tumor-associated keratinocytes in the melanoma
microenvironment, this proposal seeks to understand how melanoma modifies its microenvironment to overcome
its natural growth restraints and identify new targets to limit melanoma progression."
10885988,"Summary: Arterial stiffness is the center feature of hypertension and has significant impact upon disease
etiology and outcomes. So far, there is no cure for hypertensive arterial stiffness. Therefore, it is urgent
to identify potential therapeutic targets that can reduce hypertensive arterial stiffness. Emerging evidence
indicates that pericyte is a novel target of angiogenesis and vascular remodeling. Pericytes are a
subpopulation of mesenchymal stem cells which can differentiate into osteoblasts, vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs) and fibroblasts. Pericytes promotes fibrosis formation via pericyte-(myo)-fibroblast
transition (PFT). Pericyte also has been shown to differentiate into VSMCs at arterial remodeling zones
in the heart. Our recent study found that deletion of oxygen sensor prolyl hydroxylase-2 (PHD2) in the
endothelium resulted in excessive pericyte recruitment and arterial stiffness, and exacerbation of
angiotensin II (Ang-II)-induced hypertension. Knockout of endothelial PHD2 caused an imbalanced
arginase-2/eNOS favoring in arginase-2. Furthermore, knockout of endothelial PHD2 significantly
increased osteogenic differentiation markers (SOX9, BMP2 and osteopontin) in the aorta and promoted
VSMC calcification. Using NG2 pericyte tracing reporter NG2DsRedBAC mice, our preliminary study
further suggested an important role of NG2+ pericyte in Ang-II mediating vascular remodeling. Based on
our findings, we hypothesize that deactivation of PHD2 in EC enhances arterial stiffness and
hypertension by the mechanisms involving an imbalanced arginase-2/eNOS and pericyte differentiation
into VSMCs, osteogenic cells and fibroblasts via HIF-2α-PFKFB3 signaling pathway. Two specific aims
will be proposed to test: Aim 1: To define the molecular mechanisms by which endothelial PHD2
regulates arterial stiffness with a focus on an imbalanced arginase-2/eNOS. We will determine: (i)
whether deficiency of endothelial PHD2 induces an imbalanced arginase-2/eNOS via HIF-2α-PFKFB3
signaling pathway, (ii) whether pharmacologic blockade of HIF-2α using a clinic relevant and highly
specific inhibitor PT2385 attenuates PFKFB3 expression, restores arginase-2/eNOS balances and
reduces Ang-II-induced arterial stiffness in PHD2ECKO mice; and (3) whether knockout of arginase-2
reduces vascular remodeling and arterial stiffness in PHD2ECKO mice. Aim 2: To define the role of PHD2-
PFKFB3 in mediating pericyte differentiation and hypertensive arterial stiffness. Using pericyte tracing
reporter NG2DsRedBAC (Tg) mice crossing with PHD2ECKO mice, we will test whether inhibition of
PFKFB3 attenuates osteogenic differentiation of pericytes, and reduces vascular calcification. We will
further determine whether pharmacological activation of PHD2 or inhibition of PFKFB3 attenuates Ang-
II-induced pericyte-fibroblast/VSMC transition, arterial stiffness and hypertensive vascular remodeling.
Our study has clinical translational significance for the understanding of pericytes in vascular stiffness."

Over the past several years, blood-based biomarkers that accurately detect Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) brain
pathology have been developed. However, there are no specific fluid or imaging biomarkers for primary
tauopathies including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and
frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). We have recently identified specific species of tau in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) that can identify subsets of primary tauopathies from healthy control groups and other tauopathies
with moderate specificity and sensitivity. In this study, we propose to optimize mass spectrometry methods to
better distinguish primary tauopathies in CSF. Based on the new methods, we will translate these primary
tauopathy biomarkers to blood and test if they correlate with the biomarker measures in paired CSF. This study
will provide first measures of primary tauopathies in blood and prepare for large cohort studies looking into
primary tauopathy CSF and blood to distinguish subgroups of primary tauopathies or tauopathies from other
neurological or psychiatric diseases. If blood biomarkers are developed, it will likely be widely used and could
facilitate primary tauopathy research and diagnoses."

A large proportion of breast cancer survivors—24% to 68% of them—report co-occurring psychoneurological
(PN) symptoms or the PN symptom cluster (defined as a cluster of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance) during
and after cancer treatment. Acupuncture is a safe and holistic treatment known to relieve cancer-related
symptoms, including PN symptoms. However, its role and mechanism in treating multiple PN symptoms
simultaneously remains unclear. Metabolomics can reveal systematic metabolic changes and time-effect
relationships between an intervention and the targeted disease. Metabolomic studies suggest that the
tryptophan (Trp)–kynurenine (Kyn) metabolic pathway plays a critical role in PN symptoms among cancer
survivors. It remains unknown whether the effect of acupuncture on PN symptoms is associated with regulation
of the inflammation-induced activation of the Trp-Kyn pathway or is associated with other novel pathways. This
R21’s innovative approach to these outstanding questions involves performing an integrated analysis of breast
cancer survivors’ serum and fecal metabolome and microbiome before and after an acupuncture intervention.
The goal is to understand the effect and mechanism of acupuncture in treating the PN symptom cluster among
breast cancer survivors. The specific aims are: (1) to evaluate whether a 5-week acupuncture intervention
decreases the severity of the PN symptom cluster (a composite score of pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance),
as well as each of the 3 individual PN symptoms, among breast cancer survivors; (2) to determine whether the
hypothesized decrease in the severity of the PN symptom cluster and each PN symptom following acupuncture
is associated with changes in targeted Trp-Kyn pathway metabolites; and (3) to explore associations between
changes in untargeted biomarkers in the serum and fecal metabolome and gut microbiome and the changes in
the PN symptom cluster and each PN symptom. We hypothesize that acupuncture will reduce the PN symptom
cluster through the Trp-Kyn metabolomic pathway and will also influence and produce other beneficial changes
in the metabolome and microbiome. This integration of large-scale metabolomics and microbiome markers with
PN symptom phenotypes will advance a mechanistic understanding of acupuncture and identify novel
biomarkers that could be used in future studies of personalized acupuncture approaches to symptom
management and relief among breast cancer survivors."

Organofluorine compounds possess attractive chemical, pharmacological and biological properties that have
allowed them to make paradigm shifts in the design of biopharmaceuticals and biologic materials. The
introduction of fluorine atoms into amino acids and nucleic acids opens a vast new chemical landscape with
which to alter the folding, stability, oligomerization propensity and bioactivity of peptides, proteins and DNA.
However, although shown to impart favorable properties, the impact of adding fluorine into biologic scaffolds is
rarely predictable. Further, increasing evidence suggests perfluorinated compounds promiscuously adsorb to
many of the fundamental building blocks of cells - including lipids, proteins and DNA - to elicit a plurality of
bioeffects. One of these effects, recently discovered by the PI’s lab, is the ability of organofluorine molecules to
direct protein and DNA assembly into fluorous microdomains that phase separate into fluorinated liquids without
denaturing the biologic. The PI has recently exploited these emergent properties to enable ultrasound-guidance
of fluorinated proteins in three-dimensional tissues. Building upon these preliminary findings, the proposed
research program will mechanistically explore how organofluorine compounds influence the structure and
function of adsorbed proteins and DNA and use these insights to guide the design of new supramolecular
assembled biomaterials. Our overarching hypothesis is that organofluorine compounds non-covalently adsorb
to proteins and DNA to direct their separation into fluorine-rich phases, which in turn alters their oligomeric
assembly, cellular fate and bioactivity. To test this assertion, we will expand our perfluorinated compound (PFC)
library to include a diversity of molecules with basic/acidic functionalities and heterocyclic moieties. We will use
this library to establish structure-activity relationships governing the ability of PFCs to adsorb proteins, and
investigate how PFC complexation alters protein cellular uptake, intracellular trafficking and bioactivity. In
parallel, we will use this library to study the molecular mechanisms mediating PFC-DNA interactions and examine
how PFC complexation alters DNA stability and metabolic homeostasis in exposed cells. Together, these studies
will establish a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how PFCs interact with proteins and DNA and will
allow us to rationally design fluorous biotechnologies that exploit the unusual assembly phenomenon and phase-
separation properties that emerge. As an example, we will create ultrasound-sensitive fluorine nanoemulsions
loaded with PFC-modified ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) to enable imaging-guided gene editing in kidney tissue.
Success of this research will advance the use of PFCs as a new molecular motif to control protein and DNA
assembly, and the methods developed applied to discover new reagents for intracellular transduction of
fluorinated biomacromolecules. Ultimately, advancing knowledge on how organofluorine compounds interact
with proteins and DNA, and its effects on cells, will guide the rational design of new PFC enabled technologies
with desirable functional properties for drug discovery and nanomedicine applications."

The brain shows marked plasticity across a variety of learning and memory tasks as well as during
recovery after injury. Many have proposed to leverage this innate plasticity using brain stimulation
to treat neural disorders. Implementing such treatments requires advanced engineering tools as
well as a solid understanding of how stimulation-induced plasticity drives changes in network
dynamics and connectivity at a large scale and across multiple brain areas. Here, I propose to
use our novel engineering tools to precisely manipulate neural activity in macaque sensorimotor
cortex to investigate and induce targeted cortical reorganization. I hypothesize that a closed-loop
optogenetic stimulation of somatosensory cortex based on the natural functional connectivity of
the sensorimotor system can drive cortical plasticity and induce functional recovery. The
functional connectivity maps of the somatosensory and motor cortical areas will be estimated as
a guide for targeted stimulation. In Aim 1 the effectiveness of volitional control of activity-
dependent stimulation will be investigated to both strengthen the natural existing connections and
to induce new connections. In Aim 2 the volitional control of activity-dependent stimulation will
be evaluated to induce new connections in the presence of an ischemic lesion. These aims are
designed to provide us with both behavioral and electrophysiological measures to assess the
targeted cortical reorganization. The combination of these measures can shed light on different
aspects of brain plasticity and functional recovery mechanisms. The results of these aims will be
a proof of concept for the power of refined stimulation patterns for targeted rehabilitation and
rewiring of the brain that not only can be used for neurorehabilitation but also can help understand
the circuits and connectivity in these cortical areas."

Persons with HIV (PWH) have an approximate 2-fold higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to
HIV-negative individuals, which is not explained by traditional risk factors and persists despite effective
antiretroviral therapy. Some evidence suggests that cytomegalovirus (CMV), an almost universal co-infection in
many subgroups of PWH, may be linked to increased CVD risk. However, CMV seropositivity alone (i.e., the
presence of anti-CMV antibodies) has been insufficient as a predictor of CVD, potentially due to the greater
importance of cellular immunity in the CMV-CVD pathway. Cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death
in PWH and although CMV is thought to be important, its specific contribution to CVD in PWH is unclear. Current
knowledge on the contribution of CMV to CVD is limited in several ways: 1) Few human studies have assessed
peripheral blood circulating anti-CMV T cells and prevalent atherosclerosis. 2) There is a paucity of data on
whether CMV-specific T cells are present within human atherosclerotic plaque. 3) At present there is not a
reliable animal model to investigate the infiltration of virus-specific T cells into plaque. We have shown that
CD4+ T cells co-expressing the surface markers CX3CR1, GPR56 and CD57 (i.e. `C-G-C') are largely CMV-
specific. We also showed that C-G-C+ CD4+ T cells are increased in the blood of PWH with metabolic disease
and subclinical atherosclerosis. As the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 is highly expressed on CMV-specific T cells
and traffics cells to activated endothelium, we hypothesize that inflated anti-CMV C-G-C+ CD4+ T cells recruited
to inflamed endothelium via CX3CR1 are a major driver of subclinical atherosclerosis in PWH. I am a physician
scientist skilled in immunology and microbial pathogenesis with training in infectious diseases. My tailored career
development plan will advance my skills through experiential, didactic and professional training in: (1) tissue
immunology; (2) atherosclerosis-pathogenesis; (3) clinical and translational research; (4) human-mouse chimera
models; and (5) responsible conduct of research. With a transdisciplinary mentoring panel with expertise in HIV
clinical research, epidemiology, single cell immunology, CVD, and atherosclerosis, I will accomplish the following
aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that peripheral C-G-C+ CD4+ T cells are CMV-specific and associated
with subclinical atherosclerosis in PWH. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that plaque-infiltrating C-G-C+ CD4+
T cells are CMV-specific. In Aim 3, we will use a mouse model to test the hypothesis that recruitment of circulating
CMV-specific C-G-C+ CD4+ T cells to inflamed atheroma is CX3CR1-dependent. Completion of these specific
aims will increase our understanding of whether CMV has an important role in CVD in PWH. With the completion
of my career development plan, I will gain expertise in clinical and translational research, vascular biology, and
cutting-edge immunology. The completion of this K23 award will allow me to transition to become an independent
physician scientist in the cardio-immunology space with concentration on virus-specific immune responses."
10872130,"Our brain is composed of an immense diversity of neurons that are molecularly, morphologically, and
functionally distinct. Understanding how this immense diversity of neuron types is generated and organized to
allow us and other adult animals to carry out such a vast array of complex tasks and behaviors is of great
importance. By far, most of the neurons in our adult brains are generated during development, either directly or
indirectly from the cell divisions of a defined but, rather heterogeneous population of neural stem cells.
Molecular differences exist among neural stem cells based on their location and neural stem cell themselves
can change their intrinsic genetic programs over time. Research outlined in this proposal is geared towards
better understanding of how neural stem cell extrinsic factors integrate with neural stem cell intrinsic factors to
control numbers and types of neurons produced through time and space during development.
 In the Siegrist lab, we use the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to
uncover the genetic pathways and molecular mechanisms regulating neural stem cell proliferation decisions,
from quiescence to proliferation, and then termination once development is complete. Our research goals
include gaining a better understanding of how dietary nutrient availability affects neural stem cell proliferation
decisions. In Drosophila, different neural stem cells respond differently to dietary nutrient availability. Most
enter and exit quiescence in a dietary nutrient- and PI3-kinase-dependent manner, except for a small subset.
The neural stem cells that divide continuously independent of dietary nutrient availability are the neural stem
cells that generate neurons important for memory and learning. Through genetic and single cell sequencing
techniques, we are working to identify the intrinsic differences among these neural stem cell types that
distinguish nutrient-dependence versus nutrient-independence. We are also working on determining how
dietary nutrients consumed during development regulate neural stem cell temporal programs and thus types
and numbers of neurons produced. Neural stem cells in Drosophila sequentially express a series of
transcription factors over time that specify the neuron types produced at each cell division. Whether extrinsic
factors, such as nutrient availability affects neuroblast intrinsic temporal programs is currently unknown.
Finally, we are also working to map out the neural circuitry that regulates neural stem cell proliferation
decisions in response to dietary nutrient availability. Altogether, the research outlined here will advance our
understanding of neural stem cell proliferation control during development and how dietary nutrient availability
affects types and numbers of neurons produced. These insights should stimulate new discoveries in
translational stem cell research in the context of normal development and disease states."

The increased prevalence of obesity in the US and elsewhere has led to the hypothesis that epigenetic mechanisms mediate
associations between environmental cues and obesity outcomes. However, epigenetic regions that alter obesity risk are still
largely unknown, and the current lack of a screening tool for comprehensive measurement of epigenetic modifications
hampers the identification of associated regions. Such a screen that could also be applied to any disease or exposure of
interest would be of great utility for a broad range of human health studies. The interpretation of human epigenetic data
generated using genome-scale approaches is hampered by several obstacles. Firstly, the available data are largely based
on methylation differences measured in DNA obtained cross-sectionally at different ages throughout the life course, yet DNA
methylation marks are known to vary by age. Secondly, methylation measurements are made in accessible peripheral cell
types accessible from otherwise healthy individuals, and variability of epigenetic marks between cell types means that
measurements from these cells do not always correlate with those from cell types that contribute to diseases. Finally,
alteration to epigenetic marks can be caused by disease, and this temporal ambiguity between exposure and outcome
complicates causal inference. To overcome these obstacles, we have comprehensively identified DNA methylation-
controlled regulatory regions for genomically imprinted genes, mapping the first draft of the human “imprint-ome”.
Epigenetically regulated imprinted genes are estimated to comprise 1-2% (200-400 genes) of the human genome and are
critical in the development of the early embryo; however, only ~24 imprint control regions (ICRs), regulating 70 to 80 genes,
are presently defined. Monoallelic expression of imprinted genes is regulated by parent-of-origin specific DNA methylation at
ICRs that are established prior to germ-layer specification and maintained in somatic tissues throughout life. Our overarching
goal is to leverage the newly identified ICRs, to develop a custom platform for measuring them in human specimens, and
statistically identify the subset of the human imprint-ome associated with one of the most common trace metals—cadmium,
a heavy metal that is sequestered by the placenta, contributing to placental dysfunction. Cadmium related methylation will
also be examined in relation to children’s metabolic outcomes. Once developed, this ICR custom platform will be invaluable
in identifying regions of developmental epigenetic perturbation associated with other early-acquired diseases or exposures,
creating new opportunities for early detection and understanding the fetal origins of human health and disease."

The University of Rhode Island proposes to establish the URI ESTEEMED program to provide a diverse cohort
of students from underrepresented backgrounds with the skills and resources necessary to pursue advanced
education and degree programs in bioengineering and related disciplines. The goals of URI ESTEEMED
program are (1) to develop a cohort of scholars from underrepresented backgrounds who embody critical
thinking, engineering design, and fundamental research skills that enable them to develop an early scientific
inquiry and research mindset, and (2) to support the development of Scholars’ STEM identity and self-efficacy
through self-exploration, faculty and near-peer mentoring, academic and professional development advising,
academic support and preparation, and positive research experiences. Scholars selected for URI ESTEEMED
will participate in the program through their first two years of college, which involves intentionally designed
activities, including a summer bridge program, academic year training and research activities, early exposure to
biomedical research, and strong mentoring by faculty and peers. Participants will advance through increasingly
sophisticated activities to provide them with a chance to engage in mentored bioengineering research, develop
and hone technical skills, and fully realize their scientific identity. Together with numerous community-building
activities, this progressive program will instill students with a sense of personal belonging and engagement within
the STEM community and promote participation towards advanced degree programs. We hypothesize that the
development of scholar identity and self-efficacy will result in improved academic and research performance and
deeper engagement with scientific fundamentals. The PI of URI ESTEEMED – a tenured female professor in
engineering with strong leadership and training skills – will oversee program design and implementation with
support from a professor in engineering (Co-I) who has extensive experience in the LGBTQ+ community and
curriculum development. In achieving the URI ESTEEMED goals, it is anticipated that 100% of ESTEEMED
Scholars will be prepared to enter an advanced honors program, at least 90% will enroll in an advanced program
after their sophomore year, and 90% of scholars will self-identify as a bioengineering or biomedical scientist.

10828898,"Title: Life-Long Phenotypic Correction of CF Airways
Project Summary/Abstract:
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.
Knowledge of CFTR function and cell type expression has advanced greatly since its discovery in 1989, with
notable discoveries in the last 5 years. While significant advances have been made with small molecule
modulator therapies to restore function for most CFTR mutation classes, ~10% of people with CF have not
benefited from these strategies. We have a demonstrated track record of using many categories of viral and
non-viral based reagents for gene delivery to the airways. Our goal is to achieve life-long correction from a
single dose of aerosolized viral vector. As such, efficient delivery of a therapeutic gene or gene editing
machinery to airway progenitor cells is critical. In this proposal, we advance two gene therapy technologies and
compare their pros and cons. Both strategies take advantage of the impressive transduction efficiency and
large packaging capacity of Adenoviral (Ad)-based vectors. Two potential drawbacks of Ad vectors are
transient expression and immune response, both of which will be addressed. In Aim 1 we engineer Ad-based
viral vectors with improved progenitor cell targeting and correction. We compare chimeric vectors based on
Ad5 with fibers from species B adenoviruses. In addition, we show that Ad has the capacity to penetrate airway
mucus barriers but investigate mucolytics that may further improve vector delivery. In Aim 2 we contrast
efficiency of CFTR functional correction using gene delivery and gene editing in vitro. To achieve gene
correction, will use an adenine base editor (ABE) delivered with Ad (Ad-Cas9-ABE) to correct CFTR in cells.
As a proof of principle, we focus on the CFTR nonsense mutation R553X. This mutation results in premature
termination codon and does not respond to any small molecule modulator. Following vector delivery, we will
confirm gene editing using a combination of next generation sequencing and Cl- current measurements. The
achieved levels of phenotypic correction will be compared to the PB/Ad-CFTR gene addition strategy. We
hypothesize that regardless of gene therapy strategy, a maximum threshold level of Cl- current is achievable.
This current is similar in heterozygous (CFTR+/-) or wild-type (CFTR+/+) cells. In Aim 3 we contrast gene
delivery and gene editing efficiency in pig airways. We will generate a CFTRG551D/R553X compound heterozygous
pig model to screen leading vectors designed to correct a CF mutation for which no current small molecule
treatments are available. Our goal is to provide a life-long gene repair strategy that could be adapted for a
great number of CF causing mutations. This proposed research is highly innovative. The reagents, methods,
and data generated by these experiments could be applied to gene addition or base editing for other
monogenic disorders, thereby significantly advancing the gene therapy field."

account for most health inequities. Examining SDH may be useful in identifying and monitoring HIV-related
inequities, such as racial and gender disparities in HIV testing, engagement in care, and treatment. This
proposal requests funding for a pre-doctoral research training program to address SDH including structural
racism and gender inequality, intersectional stigma, residential segregation, aging, and marginalizing
structures influencing HIV. Combatting the ongoing syndemic of SDH, HIV, affiliated co-morbidities, and other
potentially overlapping infectious diseases such as Coronavirus, requires cutting edge public health research
conducted by scientists of the highest caliber. This pre-doctoral program will be located in the department of
Sociomedical Sciences within Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health (MSPH). The training
program will take advantage of the interdisciplinary expertise across MSPH in mentoring experience and
expertise in SDH among people at risk and living with HIV. We also propose to collaborate with faculty at the
HIV Center on Clinical and Behavioral Studies at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), the
International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Program, at MSPH, and the Social Interventions Group at
the Columbia University School of Social Work. This wealth of faculty have outstanding records in publishing,
funding, and successfully mentoring trainees. We propose to fund ten MSPH pre-doctoral fellows.
Recruitment will be focused such that at least 50% of fellows enrolled will be under-represented trainees.
Eligible trainees are pre-doctoral students admitted to Columbia University's MSPH departments of
Sociomedical Sciences, Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Population and Family Health, and committed to
understanding social determinants of HIV. Trainees are required to complete in their primary department,
specific theoretical, methodological, and biostatistical pre-doctoral department requirements. All fellows will
receive mentoring and co-mentoring and will be required to complete the following training components: (1) a
Faculty-Fellow seminar that alternates hosting guest speakers discussing professional development, structural
interventions, social policies, community-engaged research, and social determinants of HIV, with a student-led
journal club, (2) coursework on social and economic determinants of health, (3) coursework on social
epidemiology, (4) coursework on HIV, (5) coursework on multilevel modeling, (6) attendance in HIV Grand
Rounds at CUIMC, (7) a course in the responsible conduct of research, (8) grantsmanship, (9) experiential
training to hone publication, and presentation skills, and (10) doctoral research on the social determinants of
HIV. This pre-doctoral program aims to prepare MSPH students for research and teaching careers that
examine SHD, and marginalizing structural factors that influence HIV, nationally and globally."
10896914,"Abstract
Aggressive malignant progression and spreading has limited a clear understanding of the
pathophysiology of SCLC. The overarching goal of this “bedside to bench” project is to elucidate
the role of inter-metastatic divergence in therapeutic resistance in small cell lung cancer (SCLC),
with a focus on how antigenic heterogeneity and dominant immunosuppressive butyrophilins
thwart protective adaptive immune responses in this disease, to develop novel interventions to
overcome these hurdles.
We will leverage a Rapid Tissue Donation (RTD) program established at Moofitt Cancer Center,
which provides timely access to the entire repertoire of metastatic lesions in terminal patients,
who generously donate their tissues for this research. Using this resource, plus CDX models
routinely generated for each SCLC patient, we will define barriers that impair the effectiveness of
immunotherapies. During the 5-year tenure of this grant we will generate a rationale for novel
immunotherapeutic trials to overcome overcome these elusive hurdles, with a focus on antigenic
heterogeneity and the role of immunosuppressive butyrophilins.
Based on our expertise on tumor immunology (Dr. Conejo-Garcia) and clinical immunotherapy
(Drs. Perez), as well as access to a Rapid Tissue Donation program, we postulate that the
effectiveness of immunotherapies against small cell lung cancer is thwarted by heterogeneous
immunogenicity across different tumor masses, along with high expression of
immunosuppressive CD277+ butyrophilins. Based on our preliminary results, our central
hypothesis is that pleural effusions and trogocytic tumor-infiltrating T cells could provide a source
of effector lymphocytes for cell therapies that would target multiple tumor masses, in combination
with targeting immunosuppressive BTN3A butyrophilins and/or tumor-derived antibodies. We
propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Define the role of inter-metastatic heterogeneity in
therapeutic resistance in human SCLC. Aim 2. Design novel T cell immunotherapies that
overcome metastatic heterogeneity in SCLC. Aim 3. Determine the potential of antibodies
produced in SCLC to overcome inter-metastatic heterogeneity. These studies will, first, define the
role and heterogeneity of neoantigens and immune cells in SCLC; a poorly characterized disease,
due in part to its aggressiveness. Most importantly, we will provide a mechanistic rationale for
more effective immunotherapies that target the diversity and dominant immunosuppressive
drivers of this human disease, which will target in novel clinical trials at Moffitt."
10923794,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 We propose to perform a novel study in the field of cellular epidemiology, that has been made possible by
the recent revolution in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology. It is well known that there are many cell-
specific functions and behaviors that have been missed by the limitations of having to rely on easily obtainable
cells, such as blood cells or lymphoblastoid cell lines, for epidemiological studies of disease causation, risk
factors, and biomarker identification. Advances in iPSC technologies now allow us to consider non-invasive
large-scale deep cellular phenotyping efforts on disease-appropriate cell types in human subjects. Robust
derivation of iPSC lines and their differentiation into organ-specific cell types is possible from blood cells. An
important benefit of iPSC-derived cells is that observed biological variation primarily represents genetic
influences, since most of the epigenetic memory of the historical organismal environment is lost.
 Our proposed study involves an innovative experimental approach to human genotype×environment
interaction (GEI). While GEI is thought to exist widely, it is relatively poorly studied in humans due to
environmental heterogeneity and the difficulty of controlling environmental exposures. Our iPSC-based cellular
approach allows us to rigorously test for GEI experimentally by examining cellular phenotypic variation before
and after a controlled environmental challenge. Our study will be the first and largest study to model human GEI
in two different iPSC-derived cell types. First, we will determine if the expected neurotoxic effect of snake venom
in neural stem cells (NSCs) is genetically driven, and secondly, whether the suspected differential response of
alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s) to environmental pollutant exposure has a genetic basis.
 This project will leverage a major existing human resource, the Mexican American Family Study (MAFS). We
will use existing cryo-preserved iPSC lines from 400 MAFS participants for the generation of well-characterized
NSCs and AT2. We propose a novel experimental and efficient pedigree-based approach for studying the genetic
basis of cellular response to environmental stress (i.e, GEI), which has previously been difficult to assess. Our
aims are: 1) assess genetic basis of NSC response to snake venom; 2) assess genetic basis of AT2 response
to a benzo[a]pyrene pollution; 3) examine the genetic basis of environmental disruption of cellular transcriptional
coherence/homeostasis; and 4) identify pleiotropic effects of cellular stress resilience on human organismal
phenotypes relevant to health.
 This project will employ a novel experimental and efficient pedigree-based approach for studying human GEI,
which has previously been difficult to assess. It also will help establish the feasibility of epidemiological scale
utilization of iPSC technology to attack biomedical problems. Finally, we expect that the proposed project will
rigorously establish the cellular basis of GEI influencing complex phenotypes of relevance to human health."

 Comparative effectiveness research (CER) in medicine is commonly conducted to discover and provide infor-
mation on possible differences between alternative drugs or treatments in their effectiveness and safety. Such
information, if reliable and accurate, can help patients, clinicians, and other healthcare stakeholders to make
better-informed healthcare decisions and improve healthcare delivery and outcomes. However, drawing valid
and relevant inferences about treatment effects from observational studies involves effort and expertise from
both subject-matter researchers and statisticians. On one hand, causal inference relies on structural assump-
tions. Two prominent classes of such assumptions are unconfoundedness or instrument variable (IV) assump-
tions. On the other hand, granted the structural assumptions, causal inference also requires statistical modeling
and estimation of population properties and associations from empirical data. The problem of statistical learning
and inference can be challenging, while allowing a large number of candidate regressors such as main effects
and interactions of covariates. The objective of our research is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a new
set of theoretically rigorous, numerically automated, and practically useful methods of statistical learning and
inference for estimating treatment effects in CER with complex, high-dimensional data. Three specific aims
are (1) high-dimensional inference about population and subpopulation average treatment effects under uncon-
foundedness with multi-valued treatments, (2) high-dimensional inference about local average treatment effects
and IV-dependent average treatment effects on the treated with multi-valued instruments and treatments, and
(3) high-dimensional inference about average treatment effects such as contrasts between survival and hazard
probabilities with longitudinal and survival data. We will investigate applications of the new methods to several
comparative effectiveness and safety studies including a recent study on comparative treatment strategies in
schizophrenia and an ongoing project to evaluate the therapeutic exchangeability of same-class drugs, for ex-
ample, direct oral anticoagulants among patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or dipeptidyl peptidase-4
inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes, while exploiting IVs created by the design of the Medicare pre-
scription drug benefit. We will develop and publicly release user-friendly computer software including transparent
documentation for direct implementation of the new methods."
10814873,"Project Summary
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be activated by partial agonists, resulting in submaximal signaling
with reduced side effects, compared to the full agonist. Increased studies have indirectly demonstrated that
partial agonists stabilize intermediate conformational states between the inactive and fully activated states with
a reduced heterotrimeric Gabg protein coupling activity from the fully activated state. Due to the technical hurdles
in delineating GPCR conformational states and populating individual intermediate states to study them
individually, a mechanistical understanding of partial agonism signaling has been challenging. By creating
conformation-biased mutants, we identified five adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) conformational states, including
two inactive states (S1 and S2), two intermediate states (S3 and S4), and a fully active state (S5), using 19F
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This result is a significant advancement to previous research.
The R291A mutant predominantly accumulates the intermediate S4 state while the R291AR293A mutant
populates both intermediate S3 state and the full activated state S5. This finding enables us to study the roles
of these intermediates and their complexes. We will use these two mutants to examine the roles of intermediate
states S3 and S4 and their interactions with G proteins and consequent signaling effects.
In Aim 1, we will characterize whether and how the intermediate states S3 and S4 interact with Gasbg. These
characterizations will include the study of conformational transitions and dynamics of intermediate states and
the effects of Gasbg and ligands on their transitions and dynamics. In Aim 2, we will map the conformational
states of the Gas and determine its intermediate states that interact with the S3 and S4 states of the A2AR. In
Aim 3, we will determine if the intermediate states S3 and S4 of the A2AR induce Gasbg states that are competent
for GTP hydrolysis, G protein dissociation, and contribution to submaximal signaling without the S5 state being
involved. We expect to correlate conformational and dynamic characteristics of the intermediate states of the
A2AR and Gas protein created from Aims 1 and 2 to the signaling efficacies of conformation-biased mutants with
ligand stoichiometries, measured in Aim 3.
The completion of this proposed project will advance our understanding of the roles that intermediate
conformations play in GPCR signaling, lead to a conceptual innovation in understanding receptor activation
beyond a simple two-state model, and potentially guide drug design based on GPCR and G protein
conformational responses to ligands. Moreover, the conformation-biased mutants will guide an approach
development in resolving the structures of intermediate complexes."
10792953,"ABSTRACT
Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death globally. It remains unclear why only a small number of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected individuals progress to TB disease. Mtb is known to rewire the
immunometabolism of infected monocyte-derived phagocytes following acute infection. Consistently, systemic
shifts in metabolism are a hallmark of TB pathogenesis, thus highlighting metabolism as a possible target for
intervention. Tyrosine, an aromatic amino acid, is shown to accumulate in the serum of TB patients compared to
healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether and how defects in tyrosine metabolism could mediate
susceptibility to Mtb infection or risk of TB progression. We found that Mtb infection of primary human myeloid
cells downregulates expression of Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH); a key enzyme involved in tyrosine
catabolism. We also identified a genetic variant associated with lower FAH expression in monocyte-derived
dendritic cells (DCs) in Peruvians who progressed to TB. We previously showed accumulation of tyrosine in the
plasma of prospectively enrolled African household contacts of TB patients who progress to TB compared to
non-progressors, consistently with a role for tyrosine catabolism in protection from TB. Importantly, knocking out
FAH in murine macrophages increased their susceptibility to Mtb infection, suggesting that impaired tyrosine
metabolism by FAH may drive loss of Mtb control. Mechanistically, tyrosine metabolites may contribute to the
altered metabolic states of Mtb-infected cells. We hypothesize that Mtb-mediated interference with tyrosine
metabolism has evolved as a mechanism of virulence and could mediate progression to TB disease. We
propose a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to define the requirement for host tyrosine metabolism
following Mtb infection. We will target FAH using gene editing of primary human myeloid cells to test whether
this key step in tyrosine metabolism is required to contain Mtb infection. We also plan to adoptively transfer fah-
deficient fetal liver cells into TB-susceptible mice to test the requirement for tyrosine metabolism in hematopoietic
cells to control Mtb infection in vivo. Secondly, we will define the metabolic consequences of FAH deletion in
Mtb-infected monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages using metabolic flux experiments, and metabolite
complementation of Mtb-infected FAH-deficient cells. Finally, we will leverage samples and datasets from two
independent cohorts of different TB disease states. The first is a cross-sectional Peruvian cohort of TB patients
and Mtb-infected and uninfected contacts, where we bio-banked plasma samples for targeted analysis of tyrosine
metabolites by high resolution mass spectrometry. The second is a previously described longitudinal cohort of
African household contacts of TB patients followed for 2 years, where we also obtained genotyping data to
explore the impact of polymorphisms in select metabolic genes on expression of tyrosine metabolites. Defining
a causal association between impaired tyrosine metabolism and TB risk would motivate for future trials to
repurpose existing agents to treat inborn errors of tyrosine metabolism as host-directed treatments against TB."
10877786,"ABSTRACT: Abdominal pain is the primary driver of morbidity in chronic pancreatitis (CP) and affects
approximately 90% of patients over the course of their disease with devastating effects on quality of life.
Etiology of pain in CP is multi-factorial. Patients with evidence of pancreatic duct obstruction due to stones
and/or strictures are offered invasive treatments such as endotherapy or surgical drainage to relieve pain.
However, response to invasive treatments is unpredictable, and currently no clinical tool is available to identify
patients who will respond to technically successful treatment. The lack of pain response is at least partially due
to supraspinal central sensitization (SCS), a phenomenon of neuropathic and neuroplastic remodeling resulting
from persistent pain stimuli. Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), an investigative technique of standardized
stimulations to test nociception (the neural signaling that encodes noxious stimuli and the downstream
experience of pain), is used in other pain conditions to differentiate between patient subgroups to guide
treatment. QST has the potential to change the management algorithm of patients with painful CP. Our
preliminary data show that pancreatic QST (P-QST) can phenotype patients with CP into three groups: normal
pain processing, segmental (T10 dermatome at the pancreas) sensitization, and widespread hyperalgesia
(consistent with SCS). In this proposal, we will evaluate the ability of P-QST to predict response to invasive
treatment for painful CP, and to develop a predictive model for individualized prediction of treatment
response. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Test the predictive capability of pre-treatment P-QST phenotype for
pain improvement following invasive treatment for painful CP. Using pre-procedure P-QST, we will phenotype
150 patients undergoing clinically-indicated invasive treatment for painful CP at UPMC and Johns Hopkins
University. Our primary outcome will be average pain score measured by Numeric Rating Scale at 6 months
post-intervention. Aim 2. Incorporate P-QST with known and suspected patient, disease, and treatment-
related factors to create a model for individualized prediction of response to invasive treatment. Using machine
learning tools, we will develop a model that optimizes the prediction of probability of response to invasive
treatment in individual patients. This will also determine the relative strength of P-QST as an overall predictor
of treatment response. Aim 3. Augment the predictive model (Aim 2) with biochemical inflammatory markers
to assess the potential to increase predictive capability for pain improvement following invasive treatment for
painful CP. The predictive model developed in aim 2 will be further strengthened by incorporating serum
neuroinflammatory markers at baseline. Our findings will be a major step toward development of
individualized prediction of treatment response following invasive treatment for painful CP. They will lay the
foundation for multicenter studies to fully define the role of P-QST in locally invasive and other treatments for
pain management for painful CP."
10877746,"Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients
with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern
PI: Valentina Kutyifa, MD, PhD
University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY
Morbidity, mortality, and health care costs of the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF) are rapidly increasing.
Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) is cost-effectively reducing HF events and death
in HF patients with a wide QRS and low ejection fraction. However, response to CRT-D is not unequivocally
present in all patients, with less benefit in those without the presence of an ECG abnormality, left bundle branch
block (non-LBBB), posing a significant treatment challenge.
Because of the conflicting and limited data on response to CRT-D in this cohort, it is possible that we currently
treat a large proportion of HF patients with non-LBBB who have limited or no benefit from the device. Therefore,
better selection of patients for this expensive therapy is warranted. One of our recent studies suggested a clinical
benefit in patients with non-LBBB and marked echocardiography response, and identified predictors. However,
there is a need to prospectively validate these predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB
in this hard-to-treat patient population, and identify potential novel ECG and echocardiography predictors,
utilizing novel statistical methods of machine learning. We propose a prospective, observational, single-arm
study in a currently guideline-indicated cohort to validate and identify predictors of echocardiography response
to CRT-D, including novel ECG and echocardiography markers, and to assess subsequent clinical outcomes in
270 HF patients with an implanted CRT-D and non-LBBB ECG pattern.
The primary aim of the study is to prospectively validating our previously identified clinical predictors of
echocardiography response to CRT-D in HF patients with non-LBBB that could enable better patient selection.
Our secondary aim is to identify the incremental value of novel ECG and echocardiography variables to predict
echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB patients, including ECG variables of sum absolute QRST
integral and ventricular electrical activation delay, and echocardiography-derived variables of left ventricular
dyssynchrony and contractility. Then we will apply the developed predictive model to prospectively identify non-
LBBB patients with CRT-D at a risk of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Tertiary aim is to identify
novel ECG and echocardiography predictors of response in non-LBBB using machine learning analysis.
Study population will include 270 HF patients with non-LBBB (135 with mild HF and 135 with advanced HF) and
an implanted CRT-D with 6 months echocardiography follow-up analyzed by an echocardiography core lab, and
assessing clinical outcomes of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death."
10874480,"Project Summary
During transcription, enhancers need to contact gene promoters across large chromosome domains.
Chromosome folding can assist enhancer-promoter communication by bringing them close together inside the
nucleus. Mutations that alter genome folding underlie many human diseases, including developmental disorders
and some cancers. Yet, even after decades of research, we do not understand the causal links between
chromatin architecture and transcription regulation. Specifically, we do not understand why DNA looping can
correlate positively, negatively, or sometimes not at all with gene activity. To move beyond correlation to
causation, we need to better understand the molecular processes that couple genome folding and gene
regulation. The cohesin complex has emerged as a key player in DNA looping, because it can hold two chromatin
fibers together and extrude DNA loops as it translocates on DNA. Cohesin is loaded on chromatin by its co-factor
NIPBL. Cohesin then translocates until it is blocked at binding sites for the CTCF transcription factor. We recently
developed tools that allow controlling various aspects of cohesin loop extrusion by manipulating NIPBL and
CTCF in mouse embryonic stem cells. These tools provide a novel approach to investigate the relationship
between loop extrusion by cohesin and transcription. In this proposed study, we will determine how transcription
and loop extrusion are molecularly coupled and elucidate the mechanisms that explain why only some genes
rely on loop extrusion to function. We will also address how cohesin loop extrusion contributes to the functions
of CTCF during cell differentiation. In addition, we will identify novel pathways that regulate enhancer-promoter
communication by modulating loop extrusion. To achieve these goals, we will combine gene editing, epigenomic
assays, biochemical assays and novel epigenome engineering modalities with high-throughput reporter assays
in mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives. These investigations will substantially deepen
our understanding of how genome folding by cohesin proteins influences gene transcription. Completion of this
project will open new avenues to explore how these processes go awry in disease, a question our group is
interested to investigate in the future."
10867347,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Uterine fibroids (UFs) are the most important benign neoplastic threat to women’s health worldwide. As no long-
term non-invasive treatment option currently exists for UFs, deeper insight into tumor etiology is key to develop
more effective therapies. In this regard, while the epi/genetic determinants of UFs have been characterized
extensively, their underlying pathogenesis nonetheless remains obscure, implicating additional factors in disease
onset. Herein, we propose a novel basis to explain UF development through pathological reprogramming of the
myometrial epitranscriptome and offer proof of concept for therapeutic intervention using inhibitors of tumorigenic
enhancer activity driven by unanticipated m6A-chromatin crosstalk. As the most abundant internal chemical
modification in mRNA, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a key determinant of posttranscriptional mRNA fate and
thus cell identity and function. Accordingly, disruption of m6A homeostasis is implicated in a diverse range of
chronic and acute human disease conditions. However, nothing is known about the role of m6A in the
pathogenesis of UFs. We now show that m6A writers METTL3 and RBM15 are aberrantly upregulated in UFs
compared to adjacent myometrium (MM). Further, we show that METTL3 depletion triggers UF cell death and
global upregulation of transcriptionally repressive histone methylation, linking m6A for the first time with UF tumor
biology and revealing its novel crosstalk with the UF epigenome. Integrated RNA methylation and expression
profiling in METTL3-deficient UF cells revealed a profoundly altered m6A modification landscape and identified
high-confidence m6A-modified mRNA effectors of METTL3-driven UF cell growth and survival. Based on these
findings, we hypothesize that aberrant METTL3-dependent RNA methylation reprograms the MM
epitranscriptome, leading to epigenetic dysregulation and altered expression of genes that drive UF initiation and
progression. Accordingly, we propose that epigenetic inhibitors, through suppression of m6A-driven pro-
tumorigenic pathways, will provide therapeutic benefit in UFs. To test these hypotheses we will: (1) Establish the
basis of epitranscriptomic reprogramming in UFs. We will comparatively profile the m6A modification landscape
of mRNAs and chromosome-associated regulatory RNAs (carRNAs) from paired MM and UF tumor tissues and
investigate functional cooperativity between METTL3 and RBM15 in methylomic reprogramming; (2) Delineate
the role of METTL3-dependent RNA methylation in fibrotic transformation. We will ask if METTL3, in a manner
dependent upon its overexpression and methyltransferase activity, can trigger MM stem cell transformation in
vitro and UF tumor formation in vivo; (3) Elucidate the impact of METTL3-dependent RNA methylation on gene
expression in UFs. We will assess the global impact of m6A on mRNA stability and translation as well as carRNA-
dependent control of chromatin state and transcription; (4) Examine the therapeutic potential of BRD inhibitors
in a preclinical mouse model of human UFs. We will evaluate select BRD inhibitors for therapeutic efficacy,
safety, and mechanism of anti-tumor activity, including impact on chromatin status and transcription."
10866559,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The possibility of recovering ancient DNA (aDNA) molecules from archeological samples has yielded
great opportunities for the study of human evolution and history. Compared to traditional datasets
composed of a single time point collected in the present, aDNA allows for the detection of lost genetic
lineages and enables the direct assessment of allele frequencies in different time transects.
Technologies for obtaining genomic data from archeological material have catapulted the development
of the field of paleogenomics, but statistical methods to leverage information from time-series genetic
datasets lag behind these technological advances. Over the next five years, the Amorim Lab will
develop and apply methods to study human host-pathogen coevolution and adaptation using aDNA.
We seek to advance the field of paleogenomics by generating aDNA datasets that comprise large
sample sizes per archeological site and developing new methods and approaches to leverage
information from time-series genetic data. We will use these novel resources to study host-pathogen
interactions during the outbreaks of the plague in Eurasia (e.g. the Black Death) and the period of
contact between Indigenous peoples from South America and European colonizers. Contrasting models
of population evolution, both analytical and computational, with observed allele frequencies and other
summary statistics in different time transects, we will identify the genetic signatures of host-pathogen
interactions, characterize the evolutionary processes involved in human response to pathogens, and
infer the strength and timing of selective sweeps. In addition, we will characterize the Distribution of
Fitness Effects (DFE) of new mutations in the human genome across different time transects and
analyze its evolution in light of the environmental shifts caused by disease outbreaks and other events.
This study represents an advance over the state-of-the-art knowledge in paleogenomics for its focus on
evolutionary process not yet characterized with aDNA (in particular, host-pathogen coevolution), the
characterization of the DFE using time-series data, and the development of new resources (datasets
and methods). The Amorim Lab is uniquely positioned to accomplish these goals because of our
experience in combining model-based approaches with genome data analysis from ancient and modern
DNA, as well as our previous experience with the study of medieval Europeans and Native American
populations."
10862887,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Organisms are constantly exposed to environmental conditions that challenge the integrity of the genome.
Loss of genomic integrity contributes to the development of most cancers. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs)
are a dangerous type of DNA damage that can lead to rapid loss of sequence information stored within the
genome. Homologous recombination (HR) is one of the primary DSB repair pathways and is predicated on
locating an undamaged DNA sequence that matches the damaged DNA sequence elsewhere in the genome.
The homologous sequence can then be used to restore the lost DNA sequence information. During normal
mitotic growth, HR preferentially repairs DSBs using sequence information stored in the sister chromatid.
Aiding in maintenance of allelic variation between genes and preventing unbalanced exchange of genetic
information between chromosomes. In contrast during meiosis the homologous chromosome becomes the
preferred DNA repair substrate. There is a large amount information on existing pathways that have evolved in
S. cerevisiae to promote DNA repair from the homologous chromosome during meiosis. However, little is
known about how homologous chromosomes are used for repair in humans. One of the key determinants in
chromosome choice during HR, is the organization of the presynaptic complex (PSC). The regulation,
formation, and activity of the human PSC is controlled by >45 proteins. However, a basic functional unit of the
PSC consists of RAD51 and associated factors (RAD54L) during mitosis, and RAD51, DMC1 and their
associated factors (RAD54L, RAD54B, HOP2-MND1) during meiosis. Understanding how these proteins
organize into active complexes during HR is a critical step in understanding how human homologous
chromosomes are used for HR. Over the course of our studies we will use biochemical and single molecule
approaches to understand the mechanism behind RAD51 and DMC1 self-segregation during meiotic PSC
formation. We will understand how DMC1 forms a meiotic homology search complex, and with cooperation of
accessory proteins, aligns DNA sequences. We will identify how meiotic homology search complexes
overcome chromatin. Finally, we will work to understand how conflicts between the two highly related motor
protein RAD54L and RAD54B may promote homologous chromosome use during human mitotic HR. In
summary, the primary goal of this research proposal will be to use molecular biology, biochemistry, and single
molecule approaches to understand how human mitotic and meiotic PSCs organize, and promote DNA
sequence alignment during HR. The data we collect from these experiments will be used to build a model for
how human homologous chromosome selection may occur during both mitotic and meiotic HR."

(HFNC)”
Abstract
Patients with COVID-19 or other severe respiratory tract infections often develop acute hypoxemic
respiratory failure. Improving the oxygenation of these patients is critical for improving outcome. As a
selective pulmonary vasodilator, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has already become a mainstay of intensive
care units for lung failure to improve oxygenation and it is also a very potent antiseptic agent. Delivering
iNO via a noninvasive high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) method can potentially obviate the need for,
and reduce the risks associated with, invasive mechanical ventilation. We hypothesize that the NO
levels delivered with HFNC reaching the deep lung - where NO has its pharmacological effect - would
be significantly greater and better controlled than NO delivered via low flow nasal cannula. However,
the costs of current iNO technologies are prohibitive for use in high flow inhalation therapy. These costs
are associated with the long-term instability of NO and the limited payload of conventional NO gas
cylinders in which NO must be stored at low concentrations (up to 800 ppm) to prevent disproportion
reactions. We have developed a safe and very cost-effective electrochemical method for on-demand
generation of pure NO from stable solutions of inorganic sodium nitrite for medical applications. We
now propose to combine this novel technology with HFNC delivery and demonstrate the feasibility of
this new technology for safe and inexpensive delivery of iNO to the lungs at therapeutically relevant
levels via a nasal cannula. If successful, this technology can potentially shift the paradigm of iNO
therapy in healthcare settings and could be used to better treat respiratory distress caused by viral or
bacterial infections, such as in COVID-19."

Abstract
Individuals who use injection drugs are among those at highest risk for HIV-1 infection, and their relative
contribution to the total number of HIV-1-infected persons is increasing worldwide. This is particularly true for the
roughly 2 million individuals affected by the opioid crisis in the US, of who approximately 9% (180,000 persons)
are currently estimated to be HIV-1-infected. Owing to recent advances in improving access to care and
adherence to treatment, a considerable proportion of these individuals is now able to maintain undetectable viral
loads during ongoing use of opioids (oxycodone, heroin, hydromorphone, fentanyl) or opioid substitution agents
(methadone or buprenorphine). However, residual reservoirs of virally infected cells persist in these patients,
and represent the main barrier against a long-lasting drug-free remission of viral infection. Recently, there is
substantial progress in understanding the cellular compartments and mechanisms of viral reservoir persistence,
but opioid addicts were either highly underrepresented or entirely excluded from such investigations. Yet, there
are reasons to believe that the size, structure and composition of the viral reservoir in opioid users is substantially
different from HIV-1-infected individuals who do not use drugs. For instance, opioid drug abuse can profoundly
change gene expression patterns and also induces epigenetic chromatin modifications, both of which are known
to affect the susceptibility to retroviral infection, the selection of chromosomal integration sites and the
transcriptional activity of integrated HIV-1 proviruses. This project sets out to conduct a detailed analysis of the
viral reservoir structure and composition in HIV-1-infected opioid drug addicts, using a spectrum of novel next-
generation sequencing technologies allowing to profile the viral reservoir at a previously unprecedented breadth
and depth. In Specific Aim 1, we will comprehensively analyze the chromosomal location of intact HIV-1
proviruses, based on a novel experimental approach combining full-genome amplification, near full-length viral
sequencing and ligation-mediated PCR for chromosomal integration site analysis. Subsequently, we will use
ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq to characterize the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional activity of genes
harboring intact proviruses (Specific Aim 2), determine innate and adaptive immune responses correlated with
the intact proviral reservoirs (Specific Aim 3), and investigate epigenetic features associated with intact proviral
reservoir persistence (Specific Aim 4) in HIV-1-infected opioid addicts and a control cohort of HIV-1 patients
without past or present drug abuse. Together, these studies will provide a wealth of information for developing
targeted interventions to reduce HIV-1 persistence during antiretroviral therapy in HIV-1-infected individuals who
use opioids."
10832705,"This proposal is to support a robust human cohort enrolling subjects with acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), pneumonia, or sepsis (collectively termed APS) as part of the APS Consortium, and to identify clinical
and molecular features that better predict, stratify, and explain organ failure, mortality, and disability following
APS. We hypothesize that distinct and reproducible molecular subtypes are common and detectable across all
3 APS syndromes, and that we will identify the pathways that maximally contribute to organ failure and
recovery trajectory through this well-powered molecular cohort. As part of the Consortium-Wide Longitudinal
Cohort study, we propose to develop new tools for risk assessment, stratification, and recovery from APS. In
aim 1a, we will use joint modeling to integrate multiple plasma markers of inflammation, vascular dysregulation,
sarcopenia, and neural injury to identify the combinations most associated with organ failure, infer which
plasma intermediates might contribute causally to organ failures, and identify the proportion of mortality risk
mediated by specific organ failures. In aim 1b we focus on better prediction of long term disability post-APS,
testing the ability of Katz- and Lawson-informed functional status features to predict persistent disability and
asking whether prediction of disability is enhanced by added plasma markers of inflammation, vascular injury,
or neuromuscular injury. Our Center-specific aims employ novel molecular phenotyping to better explain organ
failure, death, and disability post-APS. In aim 2a we test specific hypothesis-driven candidate markers of
immune dysregulation as potential organ failure markers. Aim 2b identifies patterns of host immune health
during recovery using high dimensional flow cytometry to understand the peripheral blood host immune
response, and asks whether immune cell trajectory associates with disability or recovery. Aim 2c focuses on
vascular injury markers, and asks which components of vascular injury associate with specific organ failures
and with post-APS disabilities. In aim 3, we integrate multiple streams of biologic data and identify patterns of
response across APS acutely and during recovery, use machine learning to select the most informative
features for joint modeling, and test the performance of the model of acute or long term disability in different
APS states. Our site will make a lasting contribution to the APS Consortium and our completed aims will
advance the prevention and personalized treatment of ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis to improve overall
health."
10792923,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Despite extensive exploration into the neural mechanisms of language, there is no conclusive explanation
for why language expression through song is spared relative to speech in certain individuals with aphasia. To
investigate this phenomenon, the current study takes an innovative approach in examining how the brain
expresses language through song versus speech. We will define behavioral patterns and the structural and
functional neuroanatomy of singing, merging evidence from two distinct patient cohorts and two different
methodologies: individuals with post-stroke aphasia (n=30), and neurosurgical patients with implanted electrodes
(n=20). Both cohorts will be tested on the same set of speech and language tasks with different processing
demands: motor speech, word retrieval, and a sentence priming task. Each task will be presented in both spoken
and sung modalities. In participants with aphasia, we will analyze error patterns and inspect damaged neural
structures associated with specific performance profiles, while in the neurosurgical cohort, the analysis will shift
to temporal dynamics and sites of activity underlying each task. The novel combination of behavioral and lesion
analysis in people with aphasia and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in neurosurgical patients will
provide unique insights into the behavioral and neural mechanisms of singing.
 We will first determine which aspects of spoken language are expressed more fluently in song than in speech
by people with aphasia with different profiles of impairment. Second, we will identify which gray matter structures
and fiber pathways support the ability to produce utterances in song. Contrasting spared and damaged brain
areas between those who do better with singing and those who do not will outline regions in the left hemisphere
that are critical for sung speech production. Identifying fiber pathways uniquely spared between the two groups
will provide further information about which structural connections support sung vs. spoken speech production.
Third, we will determine the broadband high-frequency neural activity (HFA; 70-150 Hz) of spoken versus sung
language production. We will use iEEG recordings from neurosurgical patients and compare differences in neural
activity during singing and speaking as they complete the same three speech and language tasks. This will
complement the previous lesion and tractography analyses by also examining right hemisphere regions and
intra- and interhemispheric communication between regions involved in spoken and sung language production.
Overall, the novel combination of these two methods for investigating song vs speech production using the same
set of speech and language tasks has never been accomplished before and will shed new light on the
dissociation between these two systems, outlining distinct behavioral patterns, neural mechanisms, and temporal
dynamics. The clinical implications are considerable for targeted speech and language therapy for stroke
survivors as well as other clinical populations who have language production deficits."

The lack of a promoter-reporter system in ticks makes functional genomics studies challenging.
A few exogenous promoters that appear to work in tick cell lines are viral (i.e. CAAG/CMV
promoter) and are constitutively expressing. However, not all research questions can be
approached by constitutively expressing a gene. It is useful to gain temporal control over gene
expression. In eukaryotic cells, nuclear DNA and proteins combine to form chromatin, which
then undergoes complex and orderly folding to form chromosomes. For genes to be expressed,
chromatin must be in an open conformation. Open chromatin allows regulatory proteins to bind
to DNA and regulate DNA function. The assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-
throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) enables high-throughput sequencing of open chromatin
regions with the help of transposases. ATAC-seq detects chromatin accessibility of related
genes and indicates their regulatory mechanisms. Thus, genes with chromatin accessibility in
promoters are more likely to be differentially expressed at the mRNA level. Therefore, by
combining the power of ATAC-seq to analyze chromatin accessibility in the promoter regions of
whole genes in ticks’ tissues and life stages and then screening differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) at the mRNA level by transcriptome sequencing technology (RNA-seq), we will obtain
temporally and spatially expressed genes and their promoters. Therefore, our hypothesis/
objective is that by combining gene expression (RNAseq) and open chromatin regions using
ATACseq (Aim 1), and promoter assays (Aim 2), we will identify constitutive and
stage/sex/tissue-specific promoters for gene expression in ticks. Our pioneering work in tick
genome sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing has now made tick gene-editing
possible and this proposal will further help us improve the gene-editing protocol by developing
the promoter-reporter systems that will allow the screening of mutants without the need to
sequence every individual."

10804689,"Hearing and balance disorders are widespread in the US and can cause psychological distress and
impaired movement. Active sound localization, or moving the head while listening, is an example of a behavior
that integrates auditory input from both ears with input about head position (NIDCD Priority Area 1:
Perception). Indeed, people with single-sided hearing loss or cochlear implants can use head motion to
compensate for disordered auditory input. Understanding how central auditory pathways integrate auditory
input with head position signals would help us study how people can behaviorally and neurally adapt to and
cope with vestibular and auditory disorders.
 A mouse model of active sound localization would advance our understanding of the neural circuitry of
active sound localization. Mice naturally rely on hearing to find sound sources, such as seeking out their lost
pups by the sound of their cries. Moreover, there is a powerful toolkit of genetic, physiological, and imaging
tools available to dissect neural circuit function in mice. Despite all these advantages, there are no models of
active sound localization in mice. This project will fill that gap.
 The specific objective of this proposal is to determine how mice align their heads with sound in order to
localize it. My hypothesis is that auditory cortex integrates auditory input with head position signals to enable
this behavior. The central innovation of this proposal is to unite large-scale neural recordings with high-
resolution analysis of free behavior, enabling me to understand how activity in populations of neurons mediates
adaptive behavioral responses. In Aim 1, I will identify the strategies and brain regions that mice use to align
their heads with sound. In Aim 2, I will determine how neurons in the auditory cortex encode head motion and
integrate it with sound. Collectively, these studies will elucidate the neural circuitry that enables active sound
localization, and lay the groundwork for future work to understand how this circuitry confers resilience to
hearing loss.
 I will perform this research at Emory University, a leading R1 research institution with an interactive
neuroscience community and abundant intellectual and technical resources. I am a tenure-track Assistant
Professor at Emory, with my own independent lab space and equipment. I have hired a full-time research
specialist to assist in these studies, and I am able to train graduate students from Neuroscience, Biomedical
Engineering, and the MD/PhD program. I will receive guidance from two consultants: Dr. Robert Froemke at
New York University and Dr. Robert Liu at Emory. Both are experts in auditory physiology and behavior. This
support will empower me to direct an independent research program on the distributed processing in auditory
pathways that direct natural behavior and confer resilience to disorder."
10874780,"ABSTRACT
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the 2nd most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 1 million people in
the United States. PD causes difficulties with movements such as walking and speaking that occur because of
loss of the brain chemical dopamine. Current symptomatic PD treatments are based largely on dopamine
replacement therapies with L-DOPA; however, these treatments have many long-term side effects which led to
interest in non-dopaminergic therapies. The most severe side effect is the development of L-DODA-induced
dyskinesia (LID), involuntary movements that can be as or even more debilitating than the disease itself. Any
adjunct therapy extending the time frame where L-DOPA can be used without LID would be a major advance.
 Recent publications showed that low-dose ketamine infusion paradigms were safe and well tolerated in
clinical trials for pain states (including migraine headaches), treatment-resistant depression and posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). Low-dose ketamine has led to a long-term reduction of pain states, treatment-resistant
depression, it also reduced PTSD symptom severity and comorbid depression. One commonality between
migraine headaches, depression, PTSD, PD and LID is that electric activity in the brain is overly synchronized
and maladaptive plastic changes occur in the brain, including in an area that is of interest in PD and LID called
the basal ganglia (BG). Therefore, we investigated the use of low-dose sub-anesthetic ketamine in the treatment
of PD and LID. We have evidence of a therapeutic effect of low-dose ketamine infusion from preclinical data in
a rat model of LID (dose-dependent reduction of abnormal involuntary movements; long-term effects after a
single ‘infusion-treatment’) and from 5 PD patient case studies (reduced dyskinesia and reduced depression).
In the rat LID model this effect was only seen when low-dose ketamine was given for 10 hours and not with just
a single acute low-dose ketamine injection. The premise of the proposed studies to define mechanisms of the
novel use of low-dose ketamine is ‘true bench to bedside’ science, will provide the foundation for controlled
clinical trials of low-dose ketamine treatment for LID, and could identify new more specific therapeutic drug
targets to treat LID and depression, two critical problems for many PD patients. Our main hypothesis is that a
low-dose sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion desynchronizes overly synchronous oscillatory activity in nerve cells
involved in LID sufficiently to induce a lasting anti-dyskinetic effect, working as a “chemical deep brain stimulation
(DBS)”. We hypothesize that ketamine works on the molecular level via 2 types of receptor molecules in the BG
and cortex, NMDA receptors and opioid receptors, and that the long-term effect includes changes in nerve cell
connections called dendritic spines. A multidisciplinary team of researchers and a clinician with the necessary
expertise will fill a critical gap in knowledge by investigating the mechanisms of this long-term effect of low-dose
ketamine infusion on the molecular and cellular level. They will study effects on receptors and changes in spine
size and density (Aim 1), and on the systems level, investigate synchrony of oscillatory neural activity (Aim 2)."

The Cellular and Molecular Biology (CMB) training program offers doctoral candidates a multidisciplinary
education in molecular and cellular biology at institutions located within the Seattle biomedical corridor.
Administered out of the University of Washington (UW), this interdisciplinary program also supports predoctoral
trainees at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (Fred Hutch) and partner institutions. The primary
objectives of the CMB program are to recruit a diverse group of enthusiastic and motivated students who are
passionate about the biomedical sciences and to provide personalized training across a range of disciplines
pertaining to basic and translational aspects of molecular and cellular biology. These talented individuals have
the opportunity to be mentored by 63 faculty members who are experts in a range of disciplines. Students are
drawn from seven participating graduate programs that include Biochemistry, Genome Sciences, Immunology,
Microbiology, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Neuroscience, and Pharmacology. CMB trainees enter the
program in Year 2 of graduate school after holistic selection through written and oral components of the annual
application competition. Trainees complete mandatory coursework in biostatistics and fundamentals of
molecular biology; participate in the Biomedical Research Integrity Lecture series; attend a monthly student
organized research conference with speaking and networking opportunities; receive training in scientific rigor
and reproducibility, gain scientific writing skills, participate in a peer mentoring program and take part in the
annual CMB Training Grant retreat. Traditionally, the CMB program has successfully partnered with several
minority advocacy groups to promote diversity on all campuses. We continue to expand the under-represented
minority (URM) footprint and are now additionally emphasizing the recruitment and retention of students who are
the first in their families to attend college (first generation) and students with disabilities. This innovative graduate
training environment encourages trainees to pursue scientific excellence and endorses peer mentorship and the
exploration of alternative career paths. The intended outcome is to nurture a diverse close-knit group of students
who are equipped to become the next generation of scientific leaders."

Our relationship with the visual world is heavily dependent on our ability to receive and process light coming into
the eye. A portion of that light-derived information is needed for many non-image-forming visual functions like
programming our biological clocks, controlling eye movement, and influencing mood. A major region of the brain
which receives this non-image-forming visual information is located in the ventral thalamus and known as the
ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). Although the vLGN has connections with downstream regions involved
in important functions, including visuomotor function, circadian photoentrainment, and vestibular function, it has
not been well-studied. One reason for this significant gap in knowledge is that very little is known about funda-
mental characteristics of vLGN, particularly with respect to its cellular and molecular landscape, thus making it
technically challenging to develop tools to answer outstanding questions about its role in visual information pro-
cessing. This study is motivated by the need to characterize the molecular architecture of vLGN, and to identify
the neurons which form connections with retinal fibers. This project directly aligns with the BRAIN Initiative and
the NIH's Blueprint Program by expanding fundamental understanding of neuroscience using innovative re-
search methods to characterize cell types in the nervous system and mapping connected neurons in the brain.
The results of this work will significantly impact the field and generate a deeper understanding of a visual region
of the brain which receives, processes, and transmits non-image-forming visual information."

The goal of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) application is to
support the additional training, mentorship and experience needed to develop a new methodology for
analyzing the effects of repetitive brain stimulation using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in
humans. One form of repetitive brain stimulation is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS has
revolutionized the field of therapeutics for neuropsychiatric disorders – it is a novel, noninvasive treatment
option used most commonly for medication-refractory major depressive disorder. Despite this, remission rates
from its use are suboptimal and ideal stimulation parameters are unknown.
Suboptimal outcomes are due in large part to our poor understanding of TMS neurophysiology and
antidepressant effects. TMS is thought to work by altering brain excitability within a network of targeted brain
structures; for depression, this target is an emotional network including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The
ability of the brain to change excitability in response to repeated stimuli is referred to as plasticity. Noninvasive
methods of measuring plasticity, such as scalp EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are often
imprecise and unreliable. This project proposes a novel method to invasively characterize brain plasticity
induced by intracranial stimulation (Aim 1) or TMS (Aim 2) with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution. The
method involves using iEEG single-pulse evoked potentials to probe and quantify excitability change (a
correlate of plasticity) after repetitive stimulation in epilepsy patients. Network connectivity profiles will be
analyzed with both iEEG and resting state MRI (Aim 3) to provide a unique bridge between invasive and
noninvasive physiology measures. This project tests the hypothesis that repetitive brain stimulation
(delivered via TMS and intracranial stimulation) will alter brain excitability in a parameter-dependent
manner, and these effects will be most pronounced within the nodes of the stimulated brain network.
A better understanding of how repetitive stimulation propagates through brain networks and alters brain
excitability will revitalize the to-date fruitless search for reproducible biomarkers of target engagement and
treatment response with these new technologies. Novel aspects of this study include the use of TMS in human
subjects with iEEG, and the unique combination of both invasive and noninvasive connectivity measures (iEEG
and MRI) to deeply characterize network effects of stimulation. Future directions will be 1) using this method to
evaluate and refine novel brain stimulation protocols to optimize plasticity and therapeutic efficacy, and 2)
applying learned principles about network effects of repetitive stimulation to inform clinical trial design and
therapeutic use in other brain disorders, such as depression. The University of Iowa and this mentor team
provide a rich research environment and world-class facilities for implementing this proposal. These K23
activities align with my long-term career goal of optimizing therapeutic brain stimulation to improve patient care."
10848491,"Summer is a period of accelerated BMI gain for children (5-12yrs). Studies show that virtually all increases in BMI occur
during the summer, no matter children’s’ weight status (i.e., normal weight, overweight, or obese) at summer entry. Our
research team recently developed the Structured Days Hypothesis (SDH), which may explain accelerated summer BMI
gain. The SDH posits that structure, defined as pre-planned, segmented, and adult-supervised compulsory
environments, protect children against obesogenic behaviors and prevent excessive BMI gain. The SDH draws upon
the ‘filled-time perspective’, which posits that time filled with favorable activities cannot be filled with unfavorable
activities. In the context of the SDH, this means that children engage in more obesogenic behaviors that lead to
increased weight gain during times that are less-structured (e.g., summer days) compared to times that are more
structured (e.g., school days). Based on the SDH, pre-existing community-operated summer day camps (e.g., B&G
Club, YMCA), may exert a positive influence on summer BMI gain by limiting children’s engagement in obesogenic
behaviors. Recent preliminary studies show that children engage in healthier behaviors on days that they attend summer
day camps, and that BMI gain does not accelerate for these children. A major weakness in the rigor of these preliminary
studies is that they cannot identify the dose-response relationship between structured summer programming and
summer BMI gain. Dose-response studies can definitively identify the smallest dose at which a useful effect is observed
while simultaneously revealing the maximum dose beyond which there is no further beneficial effect. In the same way
determining the effective dose of structure to mitigate negative health outcomes is necessary to inform feasible, scalable
interventions and health policy. The proposed randomized dose-response study will identify the dose-response
relationship between amount of summer programming and summer BMI gain. The impact of 4 weeks (n=90, 20 days),
6 weeks (n=90, 30 days), and 8 weeks (n=90, 40 days) of summer programming compared to no program (n=90) will
be evaluated. We will also conduct comprehensive implementation monitoring to evaluate implementation, and to
identify factors associated with children’s summer BMI gain and obesogenic behaviors. The aims of the study are to:
Aim 1. Evaluate structured summer programming’s impact on children’s BMI gain and obesogenic behaviors.
Aim 2. Evaluate implementation and contextual factors and their relationship with children’s summer BMI gain and
obesogenic behaviors. Aim 3. Determine the cost effectiveness of 4, 6, 8 weeks of summer programming for mitigating
accelerated summer BMI gain. This work is significant as it addresses a critical public health goal – reducing obesity –
through programing during a timeframe – summer vacation – when substantial, long-lasting negative effects occur. This
application is innovative because of the focus on identifying the dose-response relationship between structured summer
programming and summer BMI gain. This innovation addresses a weakness in the rigor of previous studies and is
critical for identifying the ideal dose of summer programming for mitigating accelerated summer BMI gain."

Allergies are becoming a major cause of neonatal morbidity, with food allergies showing increased incidences
and significantly affecting young infants, some of which can be serious or fatal, and are associated with long-
term morbidity, imposing heavy social and economic burdens. For neonatal food allergy, no effective treatment
is currently available except avoiding or replacing the offending food, which is often impossible due to the
ubiquitous nature of some food components. Hence, there is a critical need to identify effective means of
strengthening the immune function of neonates to improve their immediate and long-term health. Human
respiratory mucosa and blood harbor secreted immunoglobulin D (IgD). We found that IgD is important in
respiratory immune defense by inhibiting mucosal adhesion of pathogens and activating antimicrobial and
immune-amplifying functions of basophils. IgD activation of basophils also suppresses IgE-induced allergic
functions, and increased food allergen-specific IgD production correlates with protection against food allergy
after oral immunotherapy in children. Maternal tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (TDaP) vaccine and
food exposure in pregnancy induces the production of vaccine- and food-specific IgD that is transferred across
the placenta to the fetus in humans and mice. The objectives here are to understand the mechanisms of the
placental transfer of IgD and to determine if maternal IgD promotes neonatal immune protection against food
allergy. We hypothesize that maternal IgD specific to vaccines or food acts as a specific and prophylactic fetal
immune education cue to protect neonates against food allergy. Of note, the basophil-activating and anti-
allergic functions are unique to IgD and not possessed by IgG. Employing biochemical and imaging techniques
in cell culture, human placenta specimens and mouse models, studies in Aim 1 will mechanistically elucidate
the placental transfer of maternal IgD. Aim 2 will determine the function of maternal food-specific IgD in the
protection against IgE-mediated neonatal food allergy by integrating neonatal mouse models of IgE-mediated
food-induced anaphylaxis with human cord or peripheral blood specimens of newborn babies with or without
food allergy in the first year of life. Our study is expected to reveal the unique functions of maternal IgD, an
ancient yet still mysterious antibody, in neonatal immune function that maternal IgG does not have, but also
have a profound impact on improving neonatal health by directing the design of IgD-targeting maternal
vaccines or adoptive immunotherapies."

Today, a critical mass of previously collected linked health care data is now available for
optimizing patient health outcomes. Information, insights, and intelligence existing in such health
care data can be unlocked efficiently using Big Data Science (BDS).As people age and live
longer, increased demand for care will be two-fold, one for those living with more comorbidities,
and second the emergent risks from new infectious diseases like COVID-19.The recent NIAID
strategic plan for COVID-19 highlights the urgent and important need for high-quality scientific
research to improve knowledge around disease transmission, surveillance, and its impact on
health outcomes, and to develop both biomedical and public health measures to mitigate illness
and death. The existence of several massive, and information rich big data streams in
healthcare (e.g., electronic health records [EHR], mobile technologies, wearable devices,
genomic data, geospatial data etc.) and the advances in information and computational
technologies (e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence) now offer an excellent hands-on
training opportunity for applying innovative Big Data science (BDS) research to infectious
diseases such as HIV/AIDS and COVID-19. To cultivate a thriving and talented pipeline of next
generation scientists, it is essential to engage current students early and provide new and
innovative training opportunities to generate interest in the biomedical, social, and behavioral,
and clinical sciences. Therefore, we propose offering a 10-week Short-Term Summer Research
Training Program titled “Big Data Health Science Scholar Program for Infectious Diseases”
targeted towards predoctoral students in physical and/or quantitative sciences (departments of
biomedical engineering, integrated information technology, chemistry/biochemistry,
mathematics, statistics etc.) from across South Carolina (SC) and the United States (US).
Predoctoral students completing this training will engage in experiential learning through hands-
on research in infectious disease areas like HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19, both relevant to the
NIAID mission. Selected predoctoral students will be paired with Program Faculty mentors from
a pool of distinguished participating faculty for one-on-one mentoring. Trainees will be chosen
through a competitive process based on their proposed research plan and goals for the summer
experience. Specifically, we plan to recruit 8 predoctoral students from physical and quantitative
sciences across the US per year (a total of 40 over the entire funding period) to participate in
the 10-week summer intensive training program with the following objectives:
Objective 1: Create a summer big data science training pipeline for qualified predoctoral
students by exposing them to relevant courses/training for competency development in the
application of BDS to infectious disease research.
Objective 2: Engage trainees in hands-on research using HIV and COVID-19 data.
Objective 3: Provide trainees with rich research mentoring experience in BDS research and
professional development for at least one year (summer included). The proposed training
program will be implemented with support of the existing infrastructure of USC's Big Data Health
Center (BDHSC). The BDHSC, one of the USC's Excellence initiatives, promotes and supports
Big Data health science research at USC and across SC through capacity development,
academic training, professional development, community engagement, and methodological
advancement. BDHSC contains 5 content cores (EHR, geospatial, genomic, social media, and
bio-nanomaterial) and two supporting hubs (business/entrepreneurship and technology) with the
involvement of 43 faculty from 10 USC college/schools. Upon the completion of the proposed
training, each trainee is expected to: 1) complete 12 hours of academic training; 2) obtain
hands-on BDS experience working on NIAID-funded research databases; and 3) develop at
least one BDS manuscript on HIV or COVID-19 with their Program Faculty mentor. The training
program will foster the research environment to encourage diverse applicants, including those

Electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), battery-operated devices that heat liquids to generate an inhaled aerosol vapor,
are increasingly popular, especially among younger users. E-cigs are seen as an increasingly attractive
alternative to tobacco cigarettes; however, little is known about the human health effects arising from chronic
exposure to these aerosols. A growing number of studies have examined potential e-cig risks for cancer,
respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases. New data from our laboratory and others, however, raise additional
human health concerns about exposure to potentially neurotoxic metals released from the heated coil wire and
other e-cig components. For example, we found that in a large fraction e-cig aerosol samples we collected,
nickel, chromium, and lead levels exceeded EPA national ambient air quality standards or ATSDR minimum
risk levels (MRL). Notably, this was true for manganese (Mn), a prime suspect in sporadic Parkinson’s disease
(PD) etiology. Others have found that vanadium, copper and selenium (all suspected for a potential role in PD)
were higher in blood of e-cig users as compared to tobacco smokers. We hypothesize that hazardous metals
released by e-cigs may accumulate in the brain and pose significant neurotoxic risk(s) for neurodegenerative
diseases upon chronic exposure. We will test our hypothesis in three ways. First, we will determine the levels
of potentially neurotoxic metals in the aerosol produced by several popular e-cigs operated under different
conditions and with e-liquids differing in flavor and nicotine content. Second, we will examine the neurotoxic
effect of chronic e-cig aerosol exposure in neuronal cell cultures derived from human subjects carrying
incompletely-penetrant mutations linked to PD or from healthy controls, and identify metal mixtures of particular
neurotoxic concern. Third, we will measure metal concentrations in brain tissue of chronically e-cig exposed
mice, which are wildtype controls or knock-in for a mutation that increases the risk for PD; we will also
determine the metals’ potential adverse effects on motor function and cognition in the mouse models. Findings
from this study are likely to provide crucial and heretofore unavailable information to policy makers and will
enable them to evaluate potential neurotoxic health risks arising from second-hand exposure to e-cig aerosol.
We hypothesize that health risks are significantly influenced by genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative
disease, as well as by e-cig device construction, operating conditions, e-liquid flavoring, and nicotine content."
10820465,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are
negatively correlated. One model assigns this correlation to the role of HDL as an acceptor of free cholesterol
(FC) transfer from arterial-wall macrophages (FC efflux), and in some studies, FC efflux better predicted
ASCVD than HDL-C concentration. However, interventions that increase plasma HDL failed to reduce ASCVD,
and, paradoxically, several studies revealed higher ASCVD mortality among patients with very high HDL. The
source of this paradox is unknown, appropriate therapies have not been formulated, and in this context, the
role of the reverse process, HDL-FC influx, which may be supported by excess HDL-FC, is unknown. Mice
deficient in the HDL-receptor, Scarb1-/- mice, are a robust model of the human high-HDL phenotype.
Compared to wild-type mice, Scarb1-/- mice are more athero-susceptible and have higher plasma levels of HDL
that is more FC-rich. This produces a state of high HDL-FC bioavailability, which we express as an index: HDL-
FCBI = HDL particle number (HDL-P) x mol% HDL-FC. This conceptually new metric was first reported by this
study team, which reported that HDL-FCBI increases as wild-type mice < human << Scarb1-/- mice and that
more FC transfers from HDL from Scarb1-/- vs. wild-type mice to macrophages. Thus, we hypothesize that
similar mechanisms underlie ASCVD among humans with very high plasma HDL-C. Our goal is to compare
patients with positive (CACS>0) and negative (CACS=0) coronary artery calcium scores respectively assigned
as ASCVD and non-ASCVD in three subgroups—those with high (HH), intermediate (IH), or optimal (OH)
plasma HDL-C concentrations—and test whether ASCVD is associated with a high HDL-FCBI. According to
our hypothesis, a) HDL-FCBI will be higher among HH vs. OH patients and among ASCVD vs. non-ASCVD
patients, especially those with high plasma HDL-C, and b) the magnitude of FC transfer from HDL from
ASCVD patients to macrophages will be greater than that from HDL from non-ASCVD patients, again
especially among ASCVD patients with high plasma HDL-C. This hypothesis is supported by studies of
Scarb1-/- mice in which a component of HDL-FCBI is reduced and with it, ASCVD—reducing HDL-P with
probucol or mol% HDL-FC by increased FC esterification suppressed ASCVD. Comparison of CACS vs. HDL-
FCBI of all three groups will reveal a non-linear functional relationship.
Traditionally, physicians have measured HDL and LDL in terms of their total cholesterol content. These
measures have had good but imperfect predictive value, mainly because the two components of TC, FC and
cholesteryl esters, have distinct metabolic itineraries that may differentially contribute to ASCVD. Validation of
the study-hypotheses in humans would provide a compelling rationale for measuring plasma lipoprotein FC as
an ASCVD diagnostic and for the formulation of therapies that reduce plasma- and especially HDL-FC."
10917039,"Project summary/Abstract
One of the main challenges in maintaining tight glucose control in individuals with type 1 diabetes
(T1D) occurs at mealtimes. Current intensive insulin therapy in T1D involves prandial insulin
boluses dependent on the carbohydrate content of the ingested meal. However, accurate
carbohydrate counting is a challenging and burdensome task for many individuals with T1D. In
this proposal, we aim to simplify mealtime diabetes management with a combination of glucose-
lowering drugs and our automated insulin delivery (AID) system using Lyumjev.
Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 is a hormone released by gut endocrine cells in response to glucose
consumption. Exogenous GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been developed to
decrease fasting and postprandial blood glucose by (i) increasing insulin secretion, (ii) decreasing
glucagon secretion, (iii) slowing gastric emptying, and (iv) reducing appetite by stimulating satiety
brain centers. Randomized controlled trials in type 2 diabetes have shown that GLP-1 RAs
improve glucose control without increasing hypoglycemia, and recent data in type 1 diabetes have
also shown promising results. Lyumjev is a novel ultra-rapid insulin lispro formulation with a faster
onset of insulin action compared to the conventional insulin lispro – Humalog. Delivering Lyumjev
at mealtimes significantly lowers postprandial glucose levels and reduces post-meal incremental
area under the curve compared to Humalog.
We aim to conduct a 2 × 2 factorial, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial
to assess if the addition of Semaglutide to an AID system with Lyumjev can alleviate the burden
of carbohydrate counting, without degrading daytime glucose control in 26 adults with T1D. The
study will consist of 4 interventions, each 4-weeks in length, testing Semaglutide-plus-lyumjev
with (i) a system that requires carb counting (AID-count) and (ii) a system that requires meal
announcement only (AID-announce), as well as placebo-plus-lyumjev with (iii) AID-count and (iv)
AID-announce. The order of the of the drug sequence (Semaglutide vs placebo) will be
randomized 1:1. Within each drug sequence, the order of the AID configuration will also be
randomized 1:1. At the start of each drug sequence, 12-week dose titration period will be initiated.
A 2-week washout period will be applied between the drug sequences. The primary outcome is
the daytime (6:00-24:00) percentage of time spent in the target glucose range (TIR), defined as
70-180mg/dL, over 4 weeks between sema-plus-lyumjev-AID-announce and placebo-plus-
lyumjev-AID-count (control arm). We hypothesize that sema-plus-lyumjev-AID-announce will
achieve non-inferior daytime TIR compared to the control arm.

 Previous studies by others and us have shown that aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is
associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in human patients and in animal models.
Furthermore, we have shown that blockade of Wnt signaling partially attenuated retinal inflammation, vascular
leakage and neovascularization (NV) in the laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model,
suggesting that dysregulation of Wnt signaling plays a key role in retinal inflammation, vascular leakage and
NV. However, the mechanism for the dysregulation of Wnt signaling in AMD remains elusive. We have
previously shown that very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) gene knockout (KO) resulted in Wnt
signaling over-activation, retinal inflammation, vascular leakage and sub-retinal NV. Our preliminary studies
demonstrated that Vldlr KO induced fibrotic factor expression in the RPE. In addition, we showed that VLDLR
is expressed predominantly in rod photoreceptors and sheds its soluble N-terminal ectodomain (sVLDLRN)
into the inter-photoreceptor matrix (IPM) to modulate Wnt signaling inter-cellularly. sVLDLRN levels in the IPM
are reduced in the CNV model and a dry AMD model. Therefore, we hypothesize that the reduced sVLDLRN
shedding into the IPM may result in Wnt signaling over-activation in the RPE, leading to retinal inflammation,
vascular leakage, sub-retinal NV and fibrosis in AMD. In this project, we will determine if the decreased
sVLDLRN shedding from photoreceptors in AMD represents a new pathogenic mechanism for retinal
inflammation, vascular leakage, sub-retinal NV, and fibrosis through over-activation of Wnt signaling.
Specifically, we will use our newly generated transgenic mice expressing sVLDLRN in rod photoreceptors and
secreting sVLDLRN into the IPM to study if over-expression of sVLDLRN in rods will attenuate Wnt signaling
over-activation, retinal inflammation, vascular leakage, sub-retinal NV, and fibrosis in AMD models.
Furthermore, we will determine if Vldlr KO only in rod photoreceptors is sufficient to induce over-activation of
Wnt signaling in the retina and RPE, leading to retinal inflammation, vascular leakage, sub-retinal NV, and
fibrosis. We also propose to investigate if sVLDLRN confers an anti-fibrotic effect through inhibition of
epithelial-mesenchymal transition induced by Wnt signaling. To explore how sVLDLRN modulates Wnt
signaling, we will define the predominant Wnt co-receptor contributing to pathologies in AMD with Lrp5 KO and
Lrp6 KO RPE cell lines generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We will also define the Wnt receptor
responsible for the interaction with sVLDLRN to inhibit Wnt signaling. This project will establish a new
pathogenic mechanism for Wnt signaling dysregulation, retinal inflammation, vascular leakage, CNV, and sub-
retinal fibrosis in AMD and identify an intercellular crosstalk between RPE and photoreceptors which
modulates Wnt signaling through sVLDLRN shedding. These studies have potential to identify a new
therapeutic target for sub-retinal fibrosis in AMD."

Heart failure affects approximately twenty-six million people globally and represents a major economic and
societal burden. This includes more than six million adults in the United States alone, a number that is predicted
to rise by 46% over the next 15 years. Heart failure is a progressive condition characterized by recurrent
exacerbations. Prior work indicates that biomarker monitoring can aid in the assessment of risk and provide
meaningful data in management of the disease. But in order to allow this to be done on a continuous basis, self-
regenerating sensors that can dynamically and continuously detect biomolecular species as a wearable system
remain an unmet need. One major challenge to fully realize these systems is the development of platforms that
allow for reagent-free analysis of complex biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites in real
time.
We recently developed the first reagentless sensor that can be adapted to any protein and demonstrated the
ability to perform continuous monitoring in vivo using an implantable sensor array. In this project, we will adapt
our technology for markers of heart failure to provide a new approach for remote monitoring of at-risk heart
failure patients. The technology that enables this is a recently developed an enzyme-free and regent-free
electrochemical reporter system that exhibits levels of sensitivity suitable for analysis of biological samples
without the need for pre-processing. Electrochemical sensors are a powerful platform for environmental or
biological monitoring based on inexpensive instrumentation and straightforward measurements of electrical
currents.
In the proposed project we will integrate these electrochemical sensors into biocompatible probes for in situ
biochemical monitoring. We will test the sensors for sensitive and robust detection of a panel markers identified
to be clinical indicators of cardiac health. Subsequently we will engineer these probes into a wearable platform
capable of continuous monitoring of biomarkers present in the interstitial fluid. Requisite hardware and software
for controlling the wearable monitoring device will be developed and tested in the project and automated analysis
will be validated in an animal model of heart failure. The project deliverables will include first-in class biomarker
monitoring systems with the potential to have a large impact on the American population by providing continual
biomarker monitoring in healthcare for chronic conditions."
10868580,"Summary
The burden on patients and caregivers when complex diseases arise creates a taxing toll for both families and
healthcare systems. Multiple inpatient hospitalizations and various testing procedures often bring more
unknowns and grief to an already difficult situation. Hospital visits disrupt patient schedules, and also place
unnecessary burdens on a healthcare system whose purpose is to maximize the health outcomes of the
patients. These complex diseases utilize extra visits and unnecessary testing. We want to develop a system
that would identify patients who could benefit from accessing their existing genetic information. Physicians may
struggle to understand the correct time to order genetic testing, and with the rapid pace of change within the
genetics field, many physicians are not utilizing the genetic testing that is available at an appropriate time.
Genetic testing also requires hospital resources from a limited pool of workers, thus every patient that presents
as a complex case may not be a suitable candidate for genetic testing. Identifying which patients should be
accessing their genetic information requires an innovative approach. At Geisinger, we have a cohort of
150,000 patients who have been sequenced and we currently have their genetic data. We propose starting
with the patients clinical presentations that are currently charted into an electronic health record to identify
phenotype terms that would trigger genetic resources to be available. These genetic resources would include
workflows that show optimal points of impact for the patients to improve healthcare outcomes. To realize this
vision, we have identified three areas that we would like to address. Identification of patients with a candidate
condition in real time, followed by a concurrent bioinformatic analysis of the genomic sequence data. Finally,
we want to address returning the genetic test result to the provider and patient so that both parties have the
appropriate information to guide condition-specific care. In order to address these three needs, we have
developed three specific aims with the experts at Geisinger in mind for implementation. Aim 1. Development of
a High Impact Phenotype Identification System (HIPIS). Aim 2. Develop Dynamic Virtual Genetic Panels
(DVGP) for real-time genetic diagnosis. Aim 3. Analysis of clinical workflows for optimal point of care
integration of real time genetic diagnosis. Collaboration with Geisinger experts as well as experts in human
phenotyping (Peter Robinson) will increase understanding about integrating genetic information into patient
care. This transformation will allow the work of many experts in various fields to be sitting at the fingertips of
primary care physicians while researching the best direction for complex diseases."
10887409,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Many studies have shown that nanoparticle (NP)-based drug formulations are effective in the diagnosis and
treatment of cancer in lab animals, but the translation of animal results to clinical success is low. This is partly
due to two fundamental challenges in this field, which are low delivery efficiency of NPs to the tumor and lack
of a robust computational model to account for NP pharmacokinetic (PK) differences across species and thus
allow one to predict tumor delivery and extrapolate the results from animals to humans. The objective of this
proposal is to develop a robust, validated, and predictive generic physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)
model for NPs in male and female tumor-bearing mice. Our hypothesis is that tissue distribution and tumor
delivery of different NPs can be predicted with a generic PBPK model by training with hundreds of datasets
with advanced mathematical methods, such as Bayesian-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulations and/or artificial neural network (ANN) methods using species- and sex-specific physiological and
NP-specific physicochemical parameters. Three specific aims were designed to achieve this objective. Aim 1:
To develop a Bayesian-based robust generic PBPK model for NPs in male and female tumor-bearing mice.
Aim 2: To develop a Bayesian-based robust and predictive generic PBPK model for NPs in male and female
tumor-bearing mice by incorporating artificial intelligence. Aim 3: To validate and optimize the Bayesian-PBPK-
ANN model with new experimental data and convert it to a web-based interface. In Aim 1, a Bayesian-MCMC
method will be used to ensure model parameters are rigorously optimized and unbiased. In Aim 2, we will test
the hypothesis that incorporation of artificial intelligence methods, such as ANN will significantly improve the
prediction accuracy, efficiency, and applicable domain of the Bayesian-PBPK model. In Aim 3, we will conduct
PK and tissue distribution experiments in tumor-bearing mice to validate our model. Recently, we published a
simple PBPK model for NPs in tumor-bearing mice and a Nano-Tumor Database that contains 376 datasets.
These studies make this proposal highly feasible. This project is novel because: (1) it is a new application of
Bayesian-MCMC and ANN methods in cancer nanomedicine; (2) it provides a tool to compare potential sex
differences in NP tumor delivery; (3) the model will be “predictive”, which makes it different from previous
studies that were mostly “correlative” analysis; and (4) the model will be converted to a web-based interface to
facilitate its application to a wider audience. This project is significant since it addresses a crucial problem of
low delivery efficiency of cancer nanomedicines, which has been a critical barrier to progress over the last 20
years. This project has broad impacts because it will greatly improve our fundamental understanding of the key
factors of NP tumor delivery and any potential sex-dependence, and will provide a tangible tool to improve the
design of NPs with higher tumor delivery efficiency to accelerate clinical translation of cancer nanomedicines
from animals to humans, and also reduce/eliminate animal experimentation in nanomedicine studies."

The overall goal of this project is to develop a new intracortical electrode array where a flat device is inserted
that then deploys microelectrodes at controlled distances within a volume of tissue. This deployable neural
interface will overcome two critical limitations associated with recording and stimulation of the cortex: 1) each
insertion only leads to placement of electrodes at a point or along a linear path within brain tissue and 2) the
recording performance is reduced by adverse tissue response. This work will result in deployable electrode
arrays using shape-changing liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrates with microelectrodes patterned by
photolithography. The LCP substrates remain flat during fabrication and processing, then deploy after
implantation to predetermined locations that are up to 200 µm away from the implantation site. The central
premise of this work is that electrode deployment from a single insertion can enable volumetric
placement of microelectrodes in mouse cortex with viable recording and stimulation capability for over
four months. The team’s published and preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of creating deployable
electrode arrays using shape-changing liquid crystal polymer (LCP) substrates with microelectrodes patterned
by photolithography. To realize this premise, three specific aims are proposed: 1) Fabricate and characterize
deployable electrode arrays, 2) Characterize the foreign body response elicited by deploying microelectrode
arrays, and 3) Characterize deploying microelectrode arrays by chronic recording and measuring
electrochemical performance of the electrodes. The team brings together the necessary expertise in materials
and microfabrication (PI Ware) and neural interface design and characterization (Co-I Pancrazio), and
histological response to implanted devices (Co-I Capadona)."

A growing number of studies has implicated maternal stress as an explanation for the higher burden of adverse
pregnancy outcomes (APOs) seen among non-Hispanic Black women compared with their non-Hispanic White
counterparts. Most studies that have explored the relationship between stress and APOs have focused solely
on prenatal exposure to stressors, but Black women are generally exposed to more stressors over the life
course than White women. Moreover, Black women may have more limited resources to cope with social
stressors, as well as be more likely to experience enduring stressors like racial and/or gender discrimination,
which may lead to dysregulated physiological and psychological responses to everyday stressors (i.e., stress
reactivity). Several studies have shown dysregulated cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and affective reactivity to
stressors is associated with increased CVD risk and other adverse health outcomes in non-pregnant
populations, but the impact of dysregulated stress reactivity on pregnancy outcomes remains poorly
understood. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to examine the impact of physiological and psychological
stress reactivity on adverse placental and pregnancy outcomes. We will use ecological momentary
assessments and intensive measurements of heart rate variability, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and
positive and negative affect to generate personalized measures of how pregnant women respond to stressful
experiences in their daily lives. We will then examine associations of these measures with adverse placental
lesions and pregnancy outcomes. Finally, we will quantify the extent to which stress reactivity and exposure to
stressors during pregnancy account for racial disparities in these adverse outcomes."

In collaboration with the Masonic Cancer Center of the University of Minnesota, Britt Erickson, MD, has
developed a research strategy that will leverage her skills in clinical trial design and execution, as well as her
experience as a mentor and educator, to improve access to NCI clinical trials within the Masonic Cancer
Center and throughout greater Minnesota.
She will open and enroll to more NCI prevention and therapeutic trials in gynecologic oncology. She will
collaborate with other disease site leaders and cooperative group principal investigators in order to prioritize
trials with the highest chances for success at the University of Minnesota. She will be the community clinical
trial liaison for the Masonic Cancer Center, opening gynecologic oncology specific NCI trials at community
sites and mentoring community oncologists in the process of clinical trial leadership and accrual. This
community extension will be done through the M Health Fairview Cancer Service Line, a novel clinical entity
established in 2019 as a result of combining efforts between the University of Minnesota and Fairview, a non-
profit healthcare delivery service. The M Health Fairview Cancer Service Line includes seven community sites
throughout the Minneapolis/St Paul metropolitan area and presents an opportunity to break down traditional
barriers between academic and community medicine, uniting with a common vision of increasing access to
therapeutic clinical trials. The Cancer Service Line has also extended to two underserved sites in rural central
Minnesota with a substantial Native American population and historically limited clinical trial access. At these
locations—working with community oncologists, existing NCORP infrastructure, and pre-existing collaborations
through the Minnesota Cancer Clinical Trials Network (a state funded network since 2017, housed at the
University of Minnesota)—Dr. Erickson will be integral to the mission of expanding NCI clinical trial access to
all Minnesotans.
Dr. Erickson’s experience and current involvement locally and nationally in NCI clinical trial work make her an
ideal candidate for the proposed plan. In addition to expanding trial availability, she will continue her local and
national service. This includes serving as a member of the Cancer Protocol Review Committee and as co-chair
of the Gynecologic Oncology Interdisciplinary Site Committee within the Masonic Cancer Center. It also
involves serving as a core member of the Uterine Corpus Committee and Cancer Prevention and Control
Committee of NRG oncology. She will also continue her work as the national PI of the phase II DCP trial of
exemestane in endometrial cancer (UWI-2016-08-01) and national PI of a new cooperative group study, NRG-
GY026, which is exploring the role of HER2 directed therapy in HER2 positive endometrial cancer, set to open
in June of 2022 with planned accrual of 525 patients."
10865037,"Mustard gas (MG, most commonly sulfur mustard and nitrogen mustard) is a chemical weapon of mass
destruction and a vesicating agent capable of penetrating mucous membranes. Ocular exposure to MG leads
to eyelid edema, conjunctival injection and chemosis, corneal epithelial defect, opacification, and
neovascularization (NV), limbal stem cell deficiency, and cataract formation, resulting in pain, visual
impairment, and blindness. Despite numerous studies in human and animals, the underlying mechanisms of
MG eye injury are not clear, and to date there is no targeted treatment. Hypoxia and inflammation are
intertwining mechanisms mediating tissue damage after burn including chemical injuries. Tissue hypoxia is an
important mechanism underlying skin and lung tissue damages after MG exposure. In our preliminary study,
we found that ocular alkali burn leads to significant intraocular tissue hypoxia, resulting in the activation of
hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling, oxidative stress, and inflammation in vivo. In addition, exposure of
human corneal epithelial cells to nitrogen mustard promotes HIF signaling in vitro. However, the role of tissue
hypoxia in ocular MG exposure in vivo has not been studied. We have engineered a perfluorodecalin-based
supersaturated oxygen emulsion (SSOE) as a topical treatment to deliver high levels (over 4 times of
atmospheric levels) of oxygen to the eye. In our preliminary work, we found that a single topical application of
SSOE at time of acute alkali burn drastically reduces intraocular hypoxia and dampens HIF signaling, oxidative
stress, and inflammation. SSOE accelerates corneal epithelial healing and ameliorates corneal opacification,
cataract formation, and tissue fibrosis in vivo. Our overarching goal in this application is to identify the
role of tissue hypoxia and inflammation in MG eye injury and to determine the efficacy of SSOE in
treating MG-related ocular damages. We have established a novel mouse model of ocular nitrogen mustard
exposure and plan to test the following aims: In Specific Aim 1, we hypothesize that tissue hypoxia occurs
rapidly after MG exposure, and we will determine intraocular oxygen levels, HIF signaling, oxidative stress, and
tissue inflammation after ocular nitrogen mustard exposure in vivo; In Specific Aim 2, we hypothesize that
SSOE treatment will reverse tissue hypoxia and reduce inflammation after MG exposure, and will determine
the efficacy of SSOE application in mitigating nitrogen mustard eye injury by assessing tissue hypoxia,
oxidative stress, leukocyte infiltration, tissue fibrosis, corneal opacification/NV, and cataract formation in vivo.
Successful completion of this proposal will not only fill in the knowledge gap in MG injury-related hypoxia
research but provide first proof-of-concept data in demonstrating the therapeutic potential of SSOE as a novel
topical treatment for acute MG exposure. Given that SSOE is formulated to be portable in a small canister and
stable at room temperature, it can potentially be stockpiled and rapidly deployed in a mustard gas attack with
mass casualty and provide countermeasure against chemical threats currently without any treatment options."

This proposal focuses on the potential role of mast cells in the control of type 2 immunopathology (T2I) elicited
by IL-33, a principal effector cytokine involved in the onset and persistence of upper and lower airway
inflammation. Preliminary studies demonstrate that mast cells are required to drive type 2 inflammation when
the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) are reduced, but paradoxically shift to an anti-inflammatory role when
PGE2 levels are sufficient. We have now found that mast cells are necessary to control the production of
soluble ST2 (sST2), a decoy receptor that binds IL-33 and limits its bioavailability in vivo. Moreover, PGE2
upregulates the expression of sST2 while downregulating the expression of ST2L, the cell surface receptor for
IL-33. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism(s) by which mast cells protect the lung from IL-33-induced T2I, and
identify the mast cell subsets that are responsible. Aim 2 will determine the receptors and molecular
mechanisms by which PGE2 alters the expressions of sST2 and ST2L, and Aim 3 will verify the importance of
these mechanisms in vivo. The studies have strong translational implications for the pathophysiology of
respiratory T2I, and could point the way toward the development of logical therapeutic strategies for asthma
and chronic sinus disease."
10911790,"ABSTRACT
Modern medical imaging systems comprise complicated hardware and sophisticated computational methods.
Given the sheer number of system parameters that impact image quality, the large variety in objects to be
imaged, and ethical concerns, the assessment and refinement of emerging imaging technologies via clinical
trials often is impossible. For these reasons, there is great interest in virtual imaging trials (VITs) that permit the
automated simulation and analysis of clinically relevant imaging experiments. During the development and
refinement of new imaging technologies via VITs, there is an important need for assessing objective image
quality measures (OIQMs) that quantify the best possible utility of the resulting images for different diagnostic
tasks—independent of the ability of the observer (human or algorithm) who interprets the images. In effect, such
OIQMs can reveal the extent to which task-related information is present in imaging data and thus can be
potentially extracted by a human observer or other numerical algorithm that is sub-optimal; this can permit the
identification of opportunities for improved image processing or other technology changes that lead to improved
performance on diagnostic tasks.
 The broad objective of the proposed research is to address this challenge by developing the next generation
of open source and modality-agnostic computational methods for computing OIQMs that quantify the best
possible performance of an imaging system—the so-called ideal observer performance—for clinically relevant
tasks. Estimation of the best achievable performance of medical imaging technologies using realistic stochastic
digital object phantoms and clinically relevant diagnostic tasks has been a holy grail for the medical image-quality
assessment field, and the lack of success to date has limited the field to unrealistic object models and tasks for
decades. When employed in VITs, our new methods will permit assessment of the amount of task-relevant
information in image data and will accelerate the refinement and translation of promising new imaging
technologies to the clinic. The Specific Aims of the project are: Aim 1: To develop and validate ambient
generative adversarial networks (AmGANs) for creating ensembles of clinically relevant digital phantoms; Aim
2: To develop methods for estimating the optimal task performance of an imaging technology; Aim 3: To use the
developed tools for assessing deep learning-based image restoration.
 The developed computational tools for computing OIQMs will be made open source. This will open entirely
new avenues for assessing and refining emerging medical imaging technologies with a level of rigor and clinical
relevance previously not possible."
10800768,"A novel breast cancer therapy based on secreted protein ligands from CD36+ fibroblasts
Cancer cells recruit and alter fibroblasts' biochemical and physical properties (FBs) to benefit their growth.
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have emerged as potential targets for reprogramming the tumor
microenvironment and for optimizing therapeutic strategies. However, there is a critical gap in research targeting
tumors and CAFs simultaneously. Breast cancer tumors have distinct subtypes. And there is a lack of a
biochemical marker exclusive to CAFs because of their heterogeneity. In fact, the currently available CAF-
targeted therapies succumb to off-target effects, so their applications are limited. We aim to address this
conundrum by testing our central hypothesis that factors secreted from non-cancer-associated FBs that express
CD36—a cell surface receptor downregulated in CAFs—could be utilized as an alternative strategy to induce
growth suppression in subtypes of breast cancer while upregulating CD36 in CAFs. This hypothesis is based on
our pilot study showing that co-transplantation of breast cancer cells with CD36+ FBs dramatically suppressed
tumor growth in animals. Furthermore, for the first time, we identified three active protein ligands in the secretome
of CD36+ FBs and determined the effective concentration of their corresponding recombinant proteins that induce
growth suppression in breast cancer cell lines while overexpressing CD36 in at least one CAF model. This study
is significant because it will have a positive translational impact on breast cancer therapy with reduced toxicity.
We will continue to test our hypothesis through two specific aims and the integration of a novel technological
platform: Aim 1a will identify breast cancer subtypes that are sensitive to the three recombinant proteins (RPs).
To this end, we will employ 3D cultures of the established cell lines and patient-derived organoids. We will also
investigate the overexpression of CD36, by the active ligands, on a panel of CAFs. To facilitate a large number
of experimental variables and intrinsic heterogeneity of organoids, we will develop a novel high-throughput
imaging and high-content screening by coupling printed 3D cultures or organoids with 3D microscopy and deep
learning methods for quantitative profiling of 3D organization and molecular features. Aim 1b will determine the
mechanisms by which the three recombinant proteins induce (a) growth suppression in sensitive breast cancer
subtypes or (b) upregulate CD36 in CAFs. Mechanistic studies will be anchored by apoptotic pathways, the cis-
regulatory networks' prediction, and the application of bioinformatics techniques. It will also include the
mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction induced by RPs. Aim 2 will use mouse models to investigate tumor
suppression in sensitive cell lines, mouse tumors, and PDX models. Resected tumors will also be profiled for
tumor morphology and molecular endpoints using advanced computational methods. In addition, in select cases,
tumor sections will be complemented with spatial proteomics/transcriptomic for additional mechanistic studies.
The study is innovative because it applies, for the first time, factors secreted from CD36+ FBs that confer tumor
suppression and could be utilized to treat subtypes of breast cancer with few side effects."

treatment response in this setting. Our conceptually innovative hypothesis is that the telomere biomarker – the
combination of cancer cell-to-cell variability in telomere length coupled with stromal cell telomere length –
captures information about tumor behavior beyond currently used indicators and thus, identifies men who are
more likely or less likely to benefit from aggressive salvage therapy. We discovered that the telomere
biomarker is an independent prognostic marker for lethal disease in surgically-treated men, identifying 3
prognostic categories: good, intermediate, and poor. The telomere biomarker has not been tested as predictive
of treatment response in any setting. We will address the aims in 2 complementary settings, trial and clinical
practice, totaling 839 men and 165 metastatic events. In the trial setting, we will use RTOG 9601, in which men
were randomized to RT+/-AAT. In the clinical practice setting, we use cohorts who received RT+/-AAT at
Johns Hopkins or Boston Medical Center and have tissue microarrays; in the analysis, we will weight by a
propensity score to minimize bias due to patient and tumor factors. We will evaluate these aims stratified by
the telomere biomarker: 1. In the standardized setting, test if rate of progression to metastasis and death from
prostate cancer differs between RT+AAT and RT only. 2. In the clinical practice setting, test if rate of
progression to metastasis and death from prostate cancer differs between RT+AAT and RT only. We will stain
for telomeres and cell-type specific immunofluorescence markers and perform image capture and quantitative
image analysis, and derive each man’s telomere biomarker. We will stratify by biomarker category and use
Cox models to estimate associations between RT+AAT and progression, and determine if the biomarker adds
to predictive capability for response to RT+AAT beyond currently used post-biochemical recurrence prognostic
indicators. In men with the biomarker category associated with intermediate prognosis, we hypothesize that the
progression rate is lower in men who received RT+AAT compared to men who received RT only. In men with
biomarker categories associated with good or poor prognosis, we hypothesize that the progression rate in men
who received RT+AAT is similar to the rate in men who received RT only. In RTOG 9601, RT+AAT was more
efficacious than RT only in some subgroups. For optimized decision-making, we will determine if the biomarker
is predictive in subgroups. If our hypothesis is confirmed, next steps would be prospective validation and
commercial partnership to generate a kit-based system for automated platforms."
10820434,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the increased attention on the eradication of malaria, prevention and treatment of the disease remain
difficult due to i) the emerging resistance to the currently available antimalarials, including front-line artemisinin-
based combination therapy (ACT), ii) the absence of a clinically effective vaccine, and iii) the spread of
insecticide-resistant vectors. Therefore, there is an urgent and continuous need for safe, affordable and novel
antimalarial drugs that can combat multiple stages of the parasite life cycle, with novel mechanism(s) of action
to overcome the emerging drug resistance. We have developed a natural product inspired novel prodiginine
chemotype with broad-spectrum antimalarial activity. Our lead prodiginine candidate meets the aforementioned
key requirements, such as 1) novel chemotype; 2) equally effective against a large panel of blood stage
Plasmodium falciparum MDR parasites; 3) prevents liver stage infection with radical cure ability; 4) effective
against sexual blood stage P. falciparum gametocytes; 5) highly likely operates by a novel mechanism of
action; 6) optimal in vitro metabolic stability and in vivo PK profiles with rapid absorption, and long half-life; and
7) synthetically accessible with low-cost production. Our proposed work in this application seeks to develop a
novel antimalarial prodiginine drug that is potent against multiple stages of Plasmodia, with the potential to
circumvent drug resistance, and prevent relapsing malaria infection. The specific goal of this project is to
conduct lead optimization studies to produce candidates of novel prodiginines that demonstrate enhanced oral
efficacy, safety, solubility, and metabolic/PK profiles that warrant further preclinical development, and to
investigate the propensity for drug resistance to selected drug candidates and identify the molecular target(s)
through whole genome sequencing and analysis."
10811679,"Summary: Globally, around 570,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer (CVC) each year, resulting in
more than 310,000 CVC-related deaths in women annually. In the United States, the National Cancer Institute
estimates that approximately 290,000 women are currently living with CVC. The five-year overall survival rate
for recurrent or metastatic CVC is lower than 20%. Although previous studies identify high-risk human
papillomavirus (hrHPV) as a causative agent of CVC, the vast majority of HPV-induced pre-cancer lesions
eventually regress, suggesting that HPV alone is insufficient to cause CVC. Unknown intrinsic factor(s)
associated with the genetic/genomic alterations of the high-risk population likely play a critical role in the
progression of HPV-induced cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinogenesis. Our recent
preliminary studies demonstrate that YAP1 (a major effector of the Hippo signaling pathway) and LATS2 (a key
kinase and upstream YAP1 suppressor in the Hippo signaling cascade) form a YAP1-LATS2 negative feedback
loop to maintain homeostasis of the cervical epithelium. Importantly, we observed that although HPV16 E6/E7
failed to induce malignant transformation of primary human cervical epithelial cells (HcerECs), they successfully
induced malignant transformation of HcerECs with a disrupted YAP-LATS2 feedback loop, leading to the
development of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that
a functional YAP1-LATS2 negative feedback loop is essential for maintaining the homeostasis of the cervical
epithelium, and the disrupted YAP1-LATS2 feedback loop is a previously unprecedented mechanism underlying
the progression of hrHPV-induced cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. In this proposed project, we will create novel
transgenic mice to model the role of the disrupted YAP1-LATS2 negative feedback loop in the formation and
progression of HPV-induced CINs (Aim 1), examine the mechanisms by which the disrupted YAP1-LATS2 loop
drives pre-cancer lesion progression (Aim 2), and test whether targeting the disrupted YAP1-LATS2 loop has
the potential to improve the prevention and treatment of CSCC (Aim 3). The achievement of the proposed studies
is expected to recognize the disrupted YAP1-LATS2 feedback loop as a previously unprecedented mechanism
underlying the progression of cervical neoplasia and carcinogenesis of the cervical epithelium. The combination
of new technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing with our unique physiological/pathological relevant
transgenic animal models is expected to identify key genes and pathways involved in the formation and
progression of HPV-induced pre-cancer lesions and the development of cervical cancer. Research results
derived from the proposed preclinical studies will provide a solid base for developing new drugs and strategies
to improve the prevention and treatment of human CSCC."
10884185,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is secreted by neurons and is important for vasodilation,
nociception, and immune responses. Drugs targeting CGRP have been a breakthrough in the treatment of
migraine headaches. Increasing clinical evidence suggests that CGRP signaling may also be involved in
gastrointestinal (GI) health and disease. For example, constipation is one of the most common side effects of
the new anti-CGRP therapies, hinting that this signaling pathway is important for normal gut motility.
Converging with the real-world experience of migraine patients, three genome-wide association studies
recently identified the CALCB locus as strongly linked to stool frequency and diverticular disease. CALCB
encodes the β-isoform of CGRP, which is highly conserved between humans and mice. The functional
significance of CALCB in the bowel, however, has not been identified. The overarching goal of this proposal
is to define the enteric neurons that secrete CALCB and determine which aspects of GI motility that CALCB
signaling is necessary for in vivo.
 CALCB and CALCA, the α-isoform of CGRP, differ by only 3 amino acids making it challenging to
distinguish them at the protein level by immunohistochemistry or ELISA. The two isoforms are encoded by
distinct loci, however, enabling their expression to be readily distinguished at the transcript level. Previous
gene expression studies showed that while CALCA is the major CGRP isoform in most of the body, CALCB
dominates in the intestine. Despite this dominance, virtually all of the studies that have probed the roles of
CGRP in gut immunity and visceral pain have identified CALCA originating from gut-extrinsic afferent neurons
as the key isoform and found CALCB to be dispensable, leaving its essential functions unclear. Utilizing the
anti-CGRP agents in clinical use as well as new genetic tools that we have generated to enable selective
labeling and manipulation of CALCB neurons in the enteric nervous system (ENS), we will accomplish three
objectives. One, determine which segments of the GI tract require CALCB, the major ENS-derived CGRP, for
normal motility in mice. Our preliminary data show that these requirements are sex-specific, suggesting that
the cellular-molecular wiring of the CGRP pathway in the intestine may be different in males and females. Two,
using genetically encoded reporters, calcium indicators and chemogenetic proteins, we will define the neurons
in the male and female ENS that release CALCB and how gut motility is affected by altering their activity.
Three, given the accumulating evidence for CGRP involvement in GI homeostasis, we will determine the
mechanisms that regulate the intestinal levels of both isoforms. In addition to advancing the fundamental
understanding of neuromuscular function in the bowel, the impact of this work will be to explain how a widely
used class of drugs causes adverse GI effects and, conversely, if isoform- or ENS-specific targeting of CGRP
signaling may be beneficial for treating GI dysmotility."

Over 75% of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have significant sleep-wake disturbances that are major
contributors to decreased quality of life and can be more disabling and resistant to treatment than the motor
symptoms of PD. Currently, the mechanisms contributing to disordered sleep in people with PD are poorly
understood and there is a critical need for therapeutic inventions to improve sleep quality. Deep brain stimulation
(DBS) has been shown to improve sleep in PD however effects are highly variable across patients. A better
understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying sleep dysfunction in PD, how DBS affects sleep quality,
and the neurophysiological changes and patterns of pathway activation with DBS that underlie these changes
would provide the rationale for development of circuit-based DBS approaches to the treatment of sleep disorders
in PD. The goal of this proposal is to: (1) characterize the changes in oscillatory activity and connectivity in the
basal ganglia-thalamocortical network during disturbances in sleep in PD patients; (2) examine the relative
effects of DBS in the STN or GPi on these changes; (3) identify the neural pathways that are preferentially
activated (or avoided) in patients with improved or impaired sleep after STN or GPi DBS. We will leverage the
well-established infrastructure at the University of Minnesota to externalize DBS leads and perform
electrophysiology recordings and stimulation studies in PD patients prior to pulse generator placement (Specific
Aims 1 and 2). We will also use high-resolution 7 Tesla (T) MRI, diffusion tractography, and subject-specific
computational biophysical modeling to associate pathway activation patterns with quantitative and qualitative
measures of sleep outcomes in the year following DBS surgery (Specific Aim 3). This project will increase our
understanding of the role of BG-cortical activity patterns on sleep and provide new insights into the mechanisms
by which DBS impacts sleep. It will inform the development of more effective stimulation strategies to normalize
sleep activity that utilize physiological biomarkers and closed-loop control paradigms tailored to individual
patient's sleep-wake cycle. These data will provide the basis to target specific pathways with DBS to optimize
sleep-related outcomes in PD."
10862799,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The scope of the problem is that 50% of patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), the leading
cause of primary proteinuric glomerular disease in adults, progress to chronic kidney disease. Thus,
developing new treatment strategies to improve FSGS patient outcomes is of utmost importance. Yet, there is
a large unmet need in our mechanistic understanding of disease progression. The traditional view in FSGS is
that podocytes are central to its pathology and that they are the first cell type to be injured. A more
contemporary view is an expansion of this paradigm and includes injury to neighboring glomerular cells. This
grant will focus on glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs). The rationale is that (1) in FSGS, GEnCs decrease in
number, loose their glycocalyx and their fenestrae widen; (2) patients with GEnC damage have the highest
rates of disease progression; (3) GEnC injury scores for all glomerular diseases are highest in FSGS; (4)
GEnC genes/biomarkers are linked to the lowest remission rates and poor long-term outcomes of FSGS. Yet
the understanding of how podocytes cause secondary GEnC injury is very incomplete. To begin to close the
knowledge gap, we undertook an in silico approach to identify paracrine ligand-receptor signaling networks
between podocytes and GEnCs. Surprisingly, we discovered that experimental and human FSGS results in a
senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and an activated inflammasome phenotype in non-aged
podocytes, both of which are characterized by the secretion of distinct classes of signaling mediators. Our
preliminary data shows that inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome in podocytes improves GEnC health. Our
specific aims will test two hypotheses: Specific Aim #1 tests the hypothesis that SASP and inflammasome
activation from injured podocytes are responsible for GEnC damage. Specific Aim #2 tests the hypothesis that
interfering with the paracrine injury signals from injured podocytes is a therapeutic target to prevent GEnC dys-
function in FSGS. The innovative experimental approaches we will use include: (i) In vivo loss-of-function
validation using mutant mice, in which we can reduce/inhibit the SASP or inflammasome phenotypes in
podocytes in the setting of experimental FSGS, and then measure the impact on GEnC health; (ii) in vivo gain-
of-function validation using transgenic mice, in which we can forcibly induce either a SASP or inflammasome
phenotype in podocytes to understand the impact on GEnCs; (iii) Quality-by-Design utilizing a systematic, high
complexity approach based on the Design-of-Experiment theory and Multivariate Data Analysis to address the
contribution of the podocyte secretome on GEnC health and function. As such, this proposal is highly
significant for its short-term impact on understanding the crosstalk between podocytes and GEnCs in FSGS,
and for its long-term impact in developing new therapeutic strategies to lower the risk and magnitude for
secondary GEnC damage in patients with FSGS."
10816510,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Liver injury from alcohol abuse, and obesity can lead to liver inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis. Liver cell
damage results in the release of inflammatory cytokines from hepatocytes and Kupffer cells (KCs), which cause
the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). If unresolved, it may result in liver fibrosis and progression to
cirrhosis. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates multiple pathways in liver fibrosis, including epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT), HSC activation, and inflammation. Further, chronic liver diseases are associated
with the dysregulation of miRNAs. Specifically, miR-96 is upregulated after liver damage and promotes fatty liver
disease (FLD). miR-96 caused malfunctioning of insulin receptor (INSR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1
results in impaired insulin signaling and glycogen synthesis. Further, miR-96 downregulates SMAD7 and
FOXO1-3 and promotes transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) mediated liver fibrosis. In our preliminary
studies, we demonstrated the upregulation of Hh signaling ligands including PTCH1, SHH, and GLI2 cause
significant increase in collagen and fat deposition in 5% ethanol and high-fat diet (HFD) fed mouse. We
synthesized a novel Hh pathway inhibitor 2-chloro-N 1-[4-chloro-3-(2-pyridinyl) phenyl]-N4, N4-bis(2-
pyridinylmethyl)-1,4-benzenedicarboxamide (MDB5) with GLI1/2 inhibitory activity in nanomolar (nM)
concentration. Treatment of both HFD and alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD) mice with MDB5 resulted in a
significant decrease in the levels of liver injury markers aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), and further ablate GLI2, and its target genes. Our miRNA profiling in ALD and HFD
mouse liver identified miR-96 was consistently upregulated. Target Scan analysis revealed that miR-96 targets
several anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrogenic genes. The knockdown of miR-96 expression in hepatocytes and
HSCs with anti-miR-96 resulted in the restoration of affected genes SMAD7 and FOXO3. We synthesized
glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) conjugated GA-PEG-P(Asp)-g-DC-g-TEPA copolymers for liver-specific in vivo delivery
of MDB5 and anti-miR-96, respectively. There was a significant increase in MDB5 concentration in the fibrotic
liver at 1h post systemic administration of MDB5 loaded GA-NPs. TGF-β and Hh signaling crosstalk whereby
TGF-β1 induces GLI-1 through downstream consequence of RAS signaling. Therefore, we hypothesize that the
combination therapy of MDB5 and anti-miR-96 using GA-NPs could prevent alcohol and fat induced liver injury,
and fibrosis. Our specific aims are to i) establish the therapeutic efficacy of the Hh inhibitor MDB5 on alcohol
and high fat diet induced liver injury; ii) establish the profibrotic role of miR-96 in in HFD and ALD mouse models,
and iii) determine the therapeutic efficacy of liver targeted NPs loaded with MDB5 and anti-miR-96 for treating
HFD and ALD mouse models. Our long-term goal is to understand the progressive mechanisms of ALD and
NAFLD to liver fibrosis, and establish new, liver-specific treatments."
10821373,"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a causative factor in the development of atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and lipid-lowering therapy can markedly reduce this risk. Yet, when to begin
lipid-lowering therapy has not been well understood. Despite the increasing rates of ASCVD in US young
adults aged 18-39 years over the past two decades, use of lipid-lowering therapy remained low, with <7% of
young adults with LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL being treated (vs. ~50% in those aged ≥40 years). It is estimated that
52% US young adults have non-optimal LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL and 7% have LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL. However, there
is little evidence to guide lipid management in young adults. For risk assessment, current guidelines
recommend using the pooled cohort equations (PCEs) to estimate 10-year ASCVD risk to guide lipid-lowering
therapy. However, PCEs may not be directly applicable to young adults as they were developed in adults 40-
75 years of age. To address this issue, current guidelines encourage the estimation of 30-year or lifetime
ASCVD risk for young adults; however, these existing lifetime risk algorithms were derived from a single cohort
of non-Hispanic whites, which may limit their applicability to other populations and has been identified as a
limitation by current guidelines. Further, social determinants of health (SDOH) and other risk enhancing factors
known to increase ASCVD risk are not included in current risk assessment. For lipid management, the
benefits and harms of initiation of lipid-lowering therapy in young adults are unknown and are extrapolated
from trial data in older adults. Although randomized trials with hard ASCVD outcomes would provide definitive
evidence, it may not be feasible to perform such a trial in young adults due to high costs and long follow-up
time needed. In the absence of trials, high quality observational and simulation studies can provide clinically
relevant and actionable evidence for policy makers, patients, and clinicians.
To address these gaps, we proposes to study ~805,000 young adults from 4 cohort studies (CARDIA,
Framingham, HCHS/SOL, JHS) and Kaiser Permanente Southern California to (1) improve ASCVD risk
assessment accuracy for young adults by using data from contemporary and diverse populations, (2) quantify
the benefits and harms of lipid-lowering therapy among young adults by emulating a clinical trial using a large
observational database and state-of-the-art statistical models to minimize confounding and selection bias, and
(3) compare the population-scale health, economic, and health equity impact of alternative lipid management
strategies for US young adults identified in the current guidelines and Aims 1 and 2.
Findings from this study will inform future guidelines by identifying strategies for more effective lipid-lowering
and ASCVD prevention in young adults, reduce health inequity by directing treatment to high-risk subgroups
not currently prioritized including those with a high burden of SDOH, and improve cardiovascular health and
promote healthy aging of US young adults."
10827456,"Project Summary: Exosome therapy holds remarkable promise to treat acute infarction, a major cause of heart
failure that affects over 6 million people in the US. Exosomes are nanoparticles secreted by cells to facilitate
intercellular signaling through their bioactive cargos such as microRNAs (miRNAs). Compared to cell-based
therapies, exosomes have distinct advantages including low immunogenicity, absence of tumorigenic risk, and
amenable for large scale production and off-of-shelf storage. Among various exosomes used for cardiac
regenerative medicine, exosomes from human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) have
received significant attention. While 2D culture has been considered as “gold standard” for exosome production,
recent studies show 3D culture promote the production of pro-reparative exosomes. To this end, we developed
nanowired human cardiac organoids, which are composed of hPSC-CMs, human primary cardiac fibroblasts,
endothelial cells, stromal cells, and electrically conductive silicon nanowires (e-SiNWs). Compared to 2D hPSC-
CM culture, organoids provide a myocardium mimetic microtissue platform, and the e-SiNWs creates a
conductive microenvironment to enhance exosome biogenesis and secretion. Compared to the unwired
organoids (without e-SiNWs), the nanowired organoids showed the significantly higher ability to improve
vascularization, preserve myocardium, attenuate pathological hypertrophy of the infarcted hearts and recover
their contractile function. To improve the reproducibility of exosomes, we developed isogenic hPSC cardiac
organoids using hPSC-CMs, -cFBs (cardiac fibroblasts), and -ECs (endothelial cells) derived from a single hPSC
line. The goal of this proposal is to determine the effects of key variables of the nanowired hPSC cardiac
organoids (i.e., size, cell composition and e-SiNW structures) on their exosome production and functionality. The
central hypothesis of the proposal is the nanowired hPSC cardiac organoids provide an electrically conductive,
biomimetic environment for hPSC-CMs, -cFBs, and -ECs to produce therapeutically potent exosomes for cardiac
repair. The proposal is innovative is that, for the first time, we will synergize electrical nanomaterials with
human cardiac organoids to enhance exosome production and functionality. Accordingly, we will pursue 2 Aims:
1): Determine the effects of cell seeding ratio, size and e-SiNW structure of the nanowired isogenic hPSC cardiac
organoids on exosome production and function, 2): Determine the therapeutic efficacy of the exosomes derived
from the optimized nanowired organoids. The proposed studies are significant in that we aim to shift the current
paradigm of exosome production to develop organ-specific therapeutic exosomes by leveraging the recent
advances in nanofabrication and engineered human cardiac organoids. These studies will provide a guiding
principle to design and develop next generation of tissue engineering constructs that can provide a source of
sustained exosome production after implantation in addition to a cell replacement therapy."
10795061,"Project Summary: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S.
The majority of CRC patients have distant or regional metastasis and a poor prognosis. Although immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB) has demonstrated favorable responses and survival benefits for mCRC patients
with mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient or microsatellite instability (MSI)-high tumors, it does not benefit
approximately 95% of mCRC patients who have MMR-proficient (pMMR) or MSI-low lesions. There is an
urgent need for methods that can sensitize pMMR/MSI-low CRC, improve recognition and presentation of
tumor-associated antigens, and activate T-cell proliferation and responses for synergistic combination with ICB
to overcome current limitations in clinical care for mCRC patients.
 We have pioneered the development of nanoscale coordination polymers (NCPs) for cancer therapy.
Formed by coordination polymerization between metal ions and polydentate ligands, NCPs preferentially
accumulate in tumor tissues by taking advantage of the enhanced permeability and retention effect and
possess several advantages over existing nanotherapeutics. The long-term goal of our research is to establish
a new treatment paradigm for metastatic colorectal cancer through the development and characterization of
NCPs that can be delivered systemically.
 We have developed OX/SN38 NCP with a hydrophilic oxaliplatin (OX) prodrug in the core and a hydrophobic
SN38 prodrug on the shell. Tumor-targeted and -activated OX/SN38 demonstrated potent anticancer effect
and synergized with an anti-PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1) for strong chemo-immunotherapy in CRC models. We
have also developed a robust NCP for the co-delivery of OX and 2’,3’-cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) agonist of
stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to tumors. OX/cGAMP significantly prolonged the half-life of cGAMP in
circulation and disrupted tumor vasculatures to enhance tumor accumulation.
 The overall goal of the proposed studies is to develop a tumor-targeted core-shell NCP, OX/CDN/Chol-D,
through the optimization of CDN and cholesterol-conjugated drug (Chol-D) separately, for the co-delivery of OX
and Chol-D to cause tumor immunogenic cell death (ICD) and the release of CDN for STING activation in the
tumor microenvironment. We will elucidate the mechanisms of enhanced drug delivery to tumors via LDLR-
mediated endocytosis and tumor vasculature disruption by OX/CDN/Chol-D and evaluate its anticancer
efficacy alone and in combination with αPD-L1 in multiple CRC models. By creating an immunogenic tumor
microenvironment, activating STING, and eliciting T-cell mediated cytotoxicity, OX/CDN/Chol-D promises to
turn immunologically “cold” CRC tumors “hot” for synergistic combination with ICB to improve immunotherapy
of mCRC. Our close collaborations on this multidisciplinary project promise to identify a novel tri-modality
nanomedicine for clinical translation to treat mCRC patients with a poor prognosis."
10840386,"SUMMARY
 Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a form of subacute liver failure with high mortality, limited treatment
options, and elusive pathogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that AH is associated with a profound
impairment in hepatocellular cholesterol homeostasis. Hepatocytes are the central hub for cholesterol
metabolism. Meanwhile, AH hepatocytes exhibit profoundly altered FC content and pathways responsible for
cholesterol esterification, transport, and conversion to bile acids. RNA sequencing studies indicate that the
dysregulation of HNF4α, a master hepatocyte transcription factor, is responsible for impaired cholesterol
homeostasis. Upregulation of HNF4α using small activating RNA (saRNA) could mitigate cholesterol toxicity in
vitro and can be developed as a treatment for AH.
 Our long-term objective is to define the disease-centric pathways of AH and develop much-needed
therapeutics for AH patients. We hypothesize that the HNF4a-dependent impairment of cholesterol
homeostasis in hepatocytes directly contributes to hepatocellular dysfunction in AH and can be targeted
therapeutically. Our approach is to map regulatory pathways of cholesterol metabolism in human AH at a
single cell resolution, functionally interrogate cholesterol metabolic pathways in murine alcohol models, and
test a novel therapeutic strategy by targeting HNF4a-dependent cholesterol toxicity.
 Aim 1 will map cholesterol metabolism in AH at single cell resolution using a multimodal approach. A three-
pronged strategy will map AH-associated changes in cholesterol homeostasis using single nuclear RNA
sequencing, ultra-high multiplexed imaging, and targeted spatial transcriptomics. The unbiased reference
maps will guide the interrogation of cholesterol metabolic pathways in cell and murine AH models.
 Aim 2 will define the impact of cholesterol dysregulation on alcohol-induced liver injury in murine models.
We will model cholesterol toxicity in 3 conditions relevant to AH using the chronic-plus-binge alcohol feeding:
(1) acute cholesterol overload, (2) impaired bile acid synthesis, and (3) impaired cholesterol secretion in
cholestasis. This effort will generate optimized murine models that recapitulate cholesterol toxicity in AH.
 Aim 3 will evaluate targeted manipulation of HNF4α-dependent pathways of cholesterol toxicity as a novel
therapeutic strategy in AH. We use saRNA to modulate HNF4α isoform expression and cholesterol
metabolism. GalNAc-conjugated HNF4α-saRNA will be tested as a hepatocyte-targeted therapeutics to
mitigate cholesterol toxicity in models of AH using differentiated human hepatocytes and murine models.
 This project is built upon a strong team of multidisciplinary scientists combining unique expertise in
lipidology, preclinical liver models, and state-of-the-art single cell and spatial technologies. The success of this
project will further our understanding of AH pathogenesis and could lead to the development of a novel AH
treatment ready for preclinical and first-in-human trials."
10836511,"Project Summary
Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a fatal complication of epilepsy that kills approximately
4,000 Americans every year. SUDEP is difficult to study because, while common, it usually occurs unobserved.
The limited clinical data that exists suggests that SUDEP is a cardiorespiratory collapse that occurs directly
after a seizure. Cardiorespiratory function is largely modulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS).
Sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous system pathways typically operate in opposition, so co-
activation is rare. In the Oxygen Conserving family of Reflexes (OCRs), both pathways co-activate to induce
breath-holding (apnea), lowered heart rate (bradycardia), and narrowing of peripheral blood vessels
(vasoconstriction). Apnea prevents aspiration. Bradycardia conserves oxygen. Vasoconstriction prioritizes
blood-carrying oxygen to essential organs (i.e. heart and brain). Seizure-induced autonomic disfunction,
coupled with an externally triggered OCR may lead to death in Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy
(SUDEP). To elucidate the causal relationship between physiological parameters, OCRs, and sudden death,
we propose to measure a physiological baseline of various oxygen conserving reflexes in healthy, anesthetized
animals in Aim 1. This will establish a baseline for the temporal relationship between: cardiac, respiratory, and
neural physiological signals in healthy animals before, during, and after OCR. It will also provide an important
data set for subsequent exploration of causal relationships between those signals in both healthy and
autonomically compromised subjects. Implications extend beyond SUDEP. In Aim 2 will then identify changes
from the physiological baseline in various oxygen conserving reflexes for seizing animals. This will provide data
of the specific role of various models of epilepsy, on compromising the autonomic system in the context of
triggered OCR, and will show the unique sequence of events leading to sudden death in seizing animals. In
Aim 3 we shift from acute to chronic animal models. We will determine the importance of awake, freely-
behaving, chronic epilepsy on the physiological chain-of-events implicated in sudden death. We will do this
using previously developed by us implantable devices to monitor the complete range of physiological
parameters in chronic, freely-behaving male and female rats. Separating seizing and non-seizing, OCR vs no-
OCR, responses in the same freely-moving animal over time will provide an entirely new window into the role
of sympathetic and parasympathetic co-activation in normal and autonomic-compromised subjects."
10837091,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Elevated blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important, potentially modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) events and death. Hemodialysis (HD) patients are at particularly high risk for these adverse
outcomes. Yet the management of BP in this population remains uncertain due to conflicting associations
depending on setting of BP measurement. We and others have reported a paradoxical, U-shaped association
of pre-dialysis systolic BP (SBP) with CVD events and death, where the nadir of the U-shape is 140-160
mmHg. However, in these same patients, the association between out-of-dialysis unit SBP and risk of mortality
and CVD is linear. We hypothesize that targeting out-of-dialysis unit (e.g. home) SBP rather than pre-dialysis
SBP (the current practice) will lead to different treatment actions and better outcomes. This would be a
paradigm shift since targeting home BP is not recommended by guidelines nor is practiced by most clinicians.
To test feasibility of home BP measurement and treatment in HD patients, we completed a 4-month pilot
clinical trial (NCT03459807) of 50 HD patients at 2 centers randomized to treatment of home SBP vs. pre-
dialysis SBP target of <140 mmHg. This pilot trial confirmed that our strategy to measure and treat home
SBP in HD patients was feasible (with excellent recruitment/retention and adherence to home BP
measurement; and successful adoption of a standardized treatment algorithm). We also identified several
patient-level facilitators of adherence to home BP measurement including: weekly home BP measurement
schedule; text message reminders; and use of technology for automated BP transmission. From these data,
we hypothesize that ongoing barriers to adoption of home BP into practice include: (1) lack of data on the
effect of treatment of home BP on important intermediate outcomes; (2) lack of data from other centers in the
U.S. to show generalizability (as most of the U.S. literature is from a single center); (3) lack of longitudinal
data on the effect of targeting pre-dialysis BP on home BP (and vice versa, in part to show that home BP
cannot be predicted from dialysis unit BP); (4) lack of knowledge of physician-level barriers to adopt
treatment of home BP in HD patients; and (5) lack of long-term adherence data using modern technology to
support clinical adoption.
To address these gaps, we now propose a larger (N=200) two-center cross-over randomized clinical trial with
longer follow-up (12 month) targeting a home SBP goal vs. a pre-dialysis SBP goal of <140 mmHg in HD
patients. The data generated from this study will lay the foundation for several next steps, including a larger,
multi-center trial to test treatment using different home BP targets to reduce rates of CVD and mortality in HD
patients as well as an implementation science trial to integrate home BP measurement into clinical care."
10773200,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The laboratory opossum is the only marsupial that is available in large numbers for biomedical research. It is a
unique or specialized model for research on many human diseases and developmental processes, as well as
for comparative biology and comparative genomics purposes. The PI maintains by far the largest breeding and
research colony of this species in the world. The most critical barrier to fulfilling the research potential of the
laboratory opossum is the lack of success of anyone in the US in establishing gene-editing procedures for this
species. A Japanese group recently overcame the technological impediments to gene editing of this species,
and succeeded in knocking out the tyrosinase (Tyr) gene in random-bred opossums. The implementation and
optimization of their methods at the PI’s laboratory will pave the way for achieving the long-term objective,
which is to establish a national research resource that will efficiently and economically create gene-
edited opossums required by US investigators to address important biomedical questions that this
laboratory animal is uniquely suited to address. While the volume of research with this species at any single
institution cannot justify the cost of establishing a large colony and gene editing technologies, a centralized
resource will be capable of serving all of the national needs at minimal cost. The specific aims are 1) to
establish expertise and proof-of-principle in our laboratory by targeted disruption of Tyr in a fully inbred
strain of laboratory opossums, and 2) to conduct targeted disruption of the phosphatase and tensin
homolog gene (Pten) in opossums of the same inbred strain. Knockout opossums will be created by applying
CRISPR-Cas9 technology to opossum embryos collected 30 - 34 hours after copulation, after which the egg
shell becomes too hard to penetrate. Penetration will be enhanced via the use of a piezoelectric actuator.
Confirmation of knockout genotype will be established by genomic DNA analysis of progeny weaned from the
treated embryos, and from subsequent generations of animals produced from those progeny. Pten -/-
homozygotes are expected to embryonic lethal, but heterozygotes are expected to serve as new model
in comparative medicine research on Autism Spectrum Disorder. We plan to establish a research project
on that topic beyond the 2-year project period, after a sufficient number of +/- animals have been produced.
Some examples of other research programs that will be made possible or highly enhanced by the creation of
specific knockouts are provided in the letters of support from investigators who are eager to collaborate.
Examples include the use of Pten +/- opossums in conjunction with Pten knockout opossum iPSCs (+/- and -/-)
from the same inbred strain for comparative research on in vivo and ex vivo neurodevelopmental processes
(Whitworth), the use of Pten +/- opossums to investigate mechanisms involved in auditory function and
regeneration (Walters), identification of genes that confer remarkable resistance of opossums to snake venom
(Sanchez), and function of T cell subsets, of which marsupials have one that is not found in eutherians (Miller)."
10886043,"Project Summary
 Epilepsy and migraine have long been recognized as being linked in certain families, but the genetic basis
of this comorbidity in not well understood. We and others have recently found evidence in human genetic
studies that variation in GPR37L1 is a major contributor to epilepsy and migraine risk, especially in cases
where epilepsy and migraine are comorbid. GPR37L1 is expressed predominantly in astrocytes, and thus
studies on this receptor may lead to more general insights into how astrocyte dysfunction contributes to
epilepsy and migraine. The goal of this project is to elucidate the cellular and mechanistic basis by which
GPR37L1 regulates seizure and migraine susceptibility. We will assess the trafficking and signaling properties
of disease-associated GPR37L1 variants in astrocytes and also address the mystery of why GPR37L1
signaling appears to be dependent on the astrocytic context. Furthermore, we will study the seizure
vulnerability of knock-in mice harboring pathogenic human variants and also explore how astrocyte
development in human cortical organoids is affected by pathogenic variants of GPR37L1. Additionally, we will
assess mice lacking Gpr37L1 or expressing pathogenic Gpr37L1 variants for migraine-relevant phenotypes
and evaluate these mutant mice for changes in cortical circuit excitability that might inform both the migraine
and seizure phenotypes. These studies will provide novel insights into the fundamental biology of GPR37L1
and also pave the way for the development of novel GPR37L1-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of
epilepsy, migraine and other diseases."
10890639,"Cognitive behavioral therapy involving exposure and ritual prevention (EX/RP) is a first-line treatment for
obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Despite its efficacy, it remains unclear how EX/RP influences the neural
mechanisms of the fear and anxiety brain networks to yield clinical improvement. Moreover, data indicate that
EX/RP outcomes may be more variable in women. Studies in rodents and healthy humans show that estrogen
(E) affects the brain regions involved in fear learning, extinction, and extinction retention (the fear extinction
network); E also has been shown to enhance extinction memory retention. In addition, the structure and
connectivity of these same brain regions predict OCD treatment outcomes, including EX/RP. These and other
data lead to the hypothesis that this Collaborative R01 will begin to test: that delivering EX/RP to women with
OCD during high E states improves extinction memory retention via enhanced engagement of the fear
extinction brain network, resulting in better clinical outcomes. We will also explore whether EX/RP-induced
extinction processes differ between women and men. Our specific aims are to examine: 1) the impact of
menstrual-cycle phase and sex on extinction-induced neural responses pre and post EX/RP; 2) the impact of
menstrual-cycle phase and sex on EX/RP outcome; and 3) the relationship between OCD symptom change
and EX/RP-induced neuronal changes. Our long-term goal is to understand how sex as a biological variable
affects specific neural processes and hence EX/RP treatment outcomes. To achieve our aims, 120 adults with
OCD – 80 natural cycling women and 40 men--will be recruited across two sites: The University of
Pennsylvania (UPenn) and the New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University (NYSPI). Through a
subcontract, New York University (NYU) will provide expertise in the fMRI imaging paradigm that will be used
as an experimental tool to probe the fear extinction brain network. Study participants will complete fMRI
scanning before and after receiving manualized EX/RP. The EX/RP protocol will consist of 8 (90 minute) daily
sessions comprised of two introductory and six exposure sessions. Women will be randomly assigned to
complete EX/RP during either: a) the first 10 days after the start of menstruation (early follicular phase), when
E levels are low; or b) days 12-22 of the menstrual cycle (late follicular, early luteal phase), when E levels are
elevated. OCD symptoms and E levels will be measured at multiple time points. This design will allow us to
study the effects of hormonal variation during the menstrual cycle and sex on the fear extinction network and
on EX/RP outcome. The results will elucidate treatment mechanisms and could lead to personalized treatment
recommendations for women with OCD."
10840853,"Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a high rate of p53 mutation (up to 80%) and widespread
chromosome instability (CIN). This high CIN is a potential vulnerability as excessive CIN can lead to cell death
and tumor suppression. A potential approach therefore is to elevate CIN in cancer to toxic levels by targeting
factors that control normal chromosome segregation in mitosis. TNBCs and other cancers with high basal CIN
may be especially susceptible to such approaches.
Aurora kinase B (AURKB) is a potential target to elevate CIN in cancer due to its roles in the spindle assembly
checkpoint and mitosis. The AURKB inhibitor Barasertib-HQPA (AZD2811) is in current clinical trials. The histone
methyltransferase SUV4-20H also regulates chromosome segregation and stability by controlling the
methylation and heterochromatin state near centromeres. In the current grant, we screened barasertib in
combination with various histone modification inhibitors for survival in breast cancer cells. We found barasertib
combined with the SUV4-20H inhibitor A196 caused pronounced synthetic lethality in p53-deficient or mutated
cells but not p53 WT cells. Among breast cancer sub-types, TNBC cells were strikingly hypersensitive to this
drug combination. The purpose of this grant is to test the potential of this drug combination against TNBC cells
and tumors, and to determine the mechanisms involved.
In the first aim we will test the model that barasertib plus A196 induces synthetic lethality in TNBC cells by
increasing CIN. TNBC cells express high levels of transcription factors ETS1/ETS2 and the ras effector protein
RASSF8, and our preliminary data suggest these factors promote sensitivity of TNBC cells to barasertib plus
A196. In Aim 2 we will knockdown or overexpress these factors to test their role in barasertib plus A196
sensitivity. In Aim 3 will test the ability of the barasertib plus A196 drug combination to effectively target TNBC
tumors in mice.
Positive results from these studies will support combined AURKB and SUV4-20H inhibition as a potential
therapeutic approach for p53 mutant TNBC. Positive results will also reveal SUV4-20H as a therapy target to
induce toxic CIN in TNBC, and potentially other cancers."
10843829,"Project Summary
U.S. women of minority race/ethnicity, lower education, lower income, rural residence, and the underinsured
experience higher breast cancer disease burden and lower survival rates than women without these
characteristics, despite recent improvements in screening access and treatments. The majority of efforts to
mitigate these disparities have focused on screening mammography access, but women must navigate
multiple additional steps when cancer is suspected, including more imaging, biopsies, and specialist
consultations. Each year, >12 million U.S. women enter this diagnostic care continuum. Failure to receive
timely, quality evaluation leads to delayed diagnosis, more invasive procedures, advanced cancer stage at
diagnosis, and greater mortality. Compared to screening, surprisingly little is known about disparities during
this diagnostic period. It is estimated that up to 30% of women with abnormalities detected by mammography
fail to obtain appropriate or timely follow-up, and up to 50% of racial/ethnic minorities and socioeconomically
disadvantaged women experience such failures. A clearer understanding of disparities along the diagnostic
continuum is hindered by the decentralized nature of breast cancer screening and diagnosis in the U.S., with
disparities in care likely due to a complex combination of individual, residential, and healthcare delivery factors.
We propose to conduct the largest U.S. observational study of disparities in diagnostic breast imaging to date.
Specifically, we aim to 1) identify specific subpopulations of women with lower access to and use of key
diagnostic imaging technologies; 2) determine differences in diagnostic outcomes that can serve as quality of
care indicators based on race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status; and 3) identify differences in timeliness of
diagnostic evaluation among disparities populations. We will use multi-level statistical modeling and mediation
analyses to account for multifactorial interactions that likely influence inequitable diagnostic care. Our team, the
Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, consists of national experts in breast cancer epidemiology,
biostatistics, health services research, medicine, and radiology. The BCSC represents the largest longitudinal
breast cancer imaging data resource linked to long-term outcomes that is representative of the general U.S.
population by race/ethnicity. We systematically collect woman-, exam-, residential-, practice-, provider- and
tumor-level data across seven regional registries and more than 200 individual practices. With data collected
for 13 million breast imaging exams, 5.5 million of which were performed among traditional disparities
populations, our team is well-positioned to carry out the proposed analyses. Our study will help shift the breast
cancer disparities research paradigm from focusing on screening access to evaluating the entire diagnostic
episode. By identifying novel quality of care metrics and “early warning” indicators of disparities, our results will
inform both practice-level interventions aimed at closing local disparities gaps and national practice guidelines
and policies directed towards more equitable breast cancer diagnostic evaluation."
10833650,"Because of a lack of safe, effective and specific treatments for disorders of water balance, the ultimate goal of
our work is to identify novel intracellular pathways by which plasma membrane accumulation of the aquaporin 2
water channel (AQP2) in kidney principal cells can be normalized in the absence of a properly functioning
vasopressin receptor (V2R) signaling pathway. The overall objective of this proposal is to dissect newly-
identified aquaporin 2 (AQP2) trafficking and regulatory pathways in order to provide actionable, basic
information that can be translated into cell-specific clinical advances for the treatment of these conditions.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is caused by renal insensitivity to VP, and results in excessive urine
production, whereas water retention, often a result of inappropriate VP secretion, occurs in conditions such as
congestive heart failure. Aim 1 addresses the hypothesis that AQP2 itself directs its intracellular trafficking
itinerary as an “active” cargo protein rather than a passive bystander. We propose that AQP2 “catalyzes”
compartment-specific actin remodeling via direct and indirect interactions with different cohorts of actin-
regulatory proteins. These include actin itself, the Arp2/3 actin remodeling complex during exocytosis, and the
actin binding protein ezrin during endocytosis. Aim 2 will identify the cellular crosstalk mechanism(s) by which a
tug-of-war between the vasopressin receptor (VP/V2R - positive action) and epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGF/EGFR - negative effect) regulate AQP2 trafficking and water balance. We will first explore how EGF and
other EGFR ligands inhibit the antidiuretic effect of VP by receptor activation and downstream signaling. Then
we will ask how inhibition of the EGFR pathway results in VP-independent AQP2 phosphorylation and membrane
accumulation by activating a non-canonical kinase, P90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). Techniques central to the
proposed work include the molecular characterization of protein interactions, advanced super resolution
microscopy and live cell imaging, enzyme activity assays, expression of modified proteins in cultured epithelial
cells, and whole animal physiology. Understanding novel cellular mechanisms of AQP2 regulation and defining
more specific participants in intracellular signaling will open unexplored avenues of research into the regulation
of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. We expect that our data will allow the development of more selective and
cell specific pharmacological strategies to regulate AQP2 trafficking in water balance disorders."
10818495,"Project Summary/Abstract
Children with hearing loss are at risk for significant language delays, which cascade into difficulties in educational
and vocational settings throughout the lifespan. However, language delays in children with hearing loss are not
universal; some children fall significantly behind children with normal hearing (CNH), while others perform
similarly to CNH. Recent work in children with mild-to-severe hearing loss (i.e., children who are hard-of-hearing
[CHH]) who wear hearing aids suggests that the degree of language impairment correlates with auditory dosage,
defined by both the degree to which a hearing aid provides access to speech and the amount of hearing aid use.
Nonetheless, the relationship between auditory access (i.e., hearing loss and auditory dosage) and language
function is still unclear. Further, the impact of auditory access on language-related neural oscillatory dynamics
is completely unknown. The proposed early-career R21 project will provide pivotal new data on the impact of
variability in auditory access on multiple tiers of language function and neuronal dynamics in school-age children.
Our promising preliminary work shows that noninvasive imaging with magnetoencephalography (MEG) can
precisely detect the neural patterns supporting language processing throughout the left-lateralized language
network in children and can quantify the relationship between altered neuronal activity and auditory dosage in
CHH. In the current study, we will characterize the associations between auditory access, language processing,
and neural development in a large cohort of CHH and demographically matched CNH. Participants will undergo
task-based MEG during a battery of language tasks, structural MRI, and neuropsychological and audiometric
testing. In Aim 1, we will identify the spatiotemporal oscillatory dynamics that underlie the behavioral differences
in language processing observed between CHH and demographically matched CNH. Deficits in language
processing in CHH will be coupled with increased task-related neural activity and altered functional connectivity
throughout the left-lateralized language network. CHH will also recruit homologous language-related regions in
the right hemisphere, indicative of a compensatory mechanism, and network-level oscillatory aberrations will
predict task performance. In Aim 2, we will characterize the impact of auditory dosage on language processing
performance and neurophysiology. We hypothesize that CHH with higher auditory dosage will exhibit better
performance in language tasks and more normalized language-related neural activity. Further, we hypothesize
that the individual contributions of hearing aid use and fit will depend on the degree of hearing loss, such that
hearing aid use will have a greater effect on children with milder hearing loss, while hearing aid audibility will be
the more significant factor in children with more severe hearing loss. This study will provide precise, quantitative
markers supporting key facets of language development and will identify the individual and additive contributions
of malleable auditory factors such as hearing aid fit and use. These data will help characterize the nature of
language impairments in CHH and be used to optimize therapeutic interventions."
10877798,"The goal of the proposal is to identify optimal lung cancer (LC) screening strategies for breast (BC), prostate
(PC), colorectal (CRC) cancer survivors. We will accomplish these goals by developing and validating a novel
Multi-Racial and Ethnic Lung Cancer Model (MELCAM) that will simulate LC development, progression,
screening, treatment, and survival in a multiethnic cancer survivor population. We will then assess the
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (CE) of different LC screening strategies for these survivors. All together,
there are >6 million BC, CRC and PC survivors in the US, and as these cancers tend to be diagnosed in early
stage, many survivors live for a long time and develop and may die from second cancers. Cancer survivors are
also at increased risk of developing LC due to relatively high rates of smoking (up to 50-60%), age, and
treatment-related side effects. As a result, >15% of LC are diagnosed in cancer survivors, and LC is the top
cause of cancer-related mortality in this population. Little is known about optimal LC screening for cancer
survivors who have been excluded from prior randomized trials (RCT) and have a different harm/benefit ratio
from screening due to competing risk of death from their first cancer and higher burden of comorbidities. Lack
of data to guide decisions about LC screening in cancer survivors has profound negative impact on
survivorship, including under and overuse of LC screening, resulting in worse outcomes and increased
healthcare costs. It is unlikely that RCT assessing the benefits of LC screening for cancer survivors will ever be
conducted. Thus, there is an urgent need to use alternative methods to determine the optimal screening
strategy for these patients. In this study, we propose using simulation modeling, an approach complementary
to RCTs, to assess the harms and benefits of LC screening in cancer survivors. The Specific Aims are to: (1)
Derive and validate a model (MELCAM), based on a well-established framework, to simulate LC screening in
BC, PC and CRC cancer survivors from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds; (2) Determine the most
effective and CE strategies for LC screening in BC survivors; (3) Identify the optimal LC screening strategies in
PC survivors and determine their CE; and (4) Evaluate the effectiveness and CE of LC screening for CRC
survivors. To achieve these Aims, we will use data from several large, representative, population-based cancer
cohorts and robust harmonization methods to develop, calibrate, and validate MELCAM by incorporating the
development, screening, work-up, treatment and survival of LC in multiethnic survivors of BC, PC and CRC
(Aim 1). We will then use the model to simulate RCTs evaluating the effectiveness (in terms of maximizing
survival, quality of life, and other patient-centered outcomes) and CE of LC screening regimens (eligibility,
frequency and duration) in these cancer survivors (Aims 2-4). The study will be innovative in applying state-of-
the-art modeling approaches to evaluate LC screening in a diverse population of cancer survivors, and results
will have direct implications for the management of a large group of survivors."
10820470,"The purpose of this grant is to obtain preliminary data to support a larger study that would recontact 11,240
participants of a successful multicenter randomized controlled trial of small class sizes called Project
Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR). This future study would provide critically important information on
whether changes to early childhood education can have positive impacts on healthy aging and risk factors for
Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). The original study, conducted
between 1985-1989, produced higher rates of high school graduation, college attendance, earnings, home
ownership, higher savings, and lower crime among treated participants relative to control participants. Because
these are social determinants of health, we expect that it also improved participants’ health and aging and
proximate risk factors for AD/ADRD. Project STAR therefore presents one potential solution to the vexing
problem of declining health in the United States.
Project STAR is unique not only because it experimentally tests the value of small class size on education, but
also because it tests other measures of classroom quality, such as teacher experience. It therefore allows for
two experiments in one.
Our short-term objectives are to examine whether Project STAR reduced premature mortality for the
treatment group relative to the control group and to assess the feasibility of recontacting the original cohort.
Our long-term objective is to turn Project STAR into a living cohort to study the social determinants of healthy
aging by collecting laboratory and survey data, including biological age, pace of aging and proximal risk factors
for AD/ADRD. The aims of the study are: 1) to collect preliminary data for a future R01; 2) to determine
whether small class sizes reduce premature mortality in mid-adulthood; and 3) to release a dataset linking
Project STAR experimental data to prospective mortality records using NDI."
10872119,"Vascular-immune interactions play a pivotal role in the initiation and propagation of ischemic stroke pathology
at the onset of ischemia and after reperfusion. In addition to contributing to underlying stroke risk, systemic
inflammation amplifies pathological effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). And while antiplatelet agents
and statins have modest effects on reducing post-stroke inflammation, targeted therapies are desperately
needed. We have discovered a novel mechanism of lung-brain coupling induced following an acute ischemic
stroke that regulates systemic inflammation, innate immune priming, neurovascular compromise, and
secondary ischemic brain damage. Our long-term goal is to identify the mechanistic basis for this response
and test whether approaches targeting post-stroke lung pathology could improve outcomes in patients
presenting after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We find that acute cerebral ischemia induces a range of lung
pathologies, including 1) simplification of alveolar structures and airway inflammation, 2) increased endothelial
permeability and lipid peroxidation, 3) changes in respiratory mechanics, and 4) selective loss of the
endogenous lung antioxidant extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3). Notably, targeted expression of
SOD3 within the distal airways abrogates stroke-induced lung pathology, inhibits systemic inflammation, and
reduce cumulative stroke burden. Collectively these data lead us to hypothesize that stroke-induced changes
in pulmonary SOD3 activity are a critical determinant of stroke outcomes via effects on systemic immune
priming and cerebrovascular resilience. In this proposal, we investigate the mechanism(s) involved in the
stroke-dependent loss of SOD3 expression (SA1), demonstrate the effects of SOD3 exhaustion on systemic
immune priming (SA2), and explore the influence of stroke risk modifiers on SOD3 regulation and stroke
outcomes. These studies provide a new perspective on potential approaches to reduce brain injury, hasten
recovery, and mitigate complications associated with AIS. In addition to expanding our understanding
regarding the fundamental underpinnings of lung-brain coupling, this work could ultimately lead to the
development of inhaled, immune-based therapies for stroke and other acute neurological conditions in which
systemic inflammation is a central component."

10870039,"Imbalance contributes to falls, fall risk increases with age, and falls cause accidental death and injury. While
causes of falls and imbalance are multifactorial, modern multivariate statistical analyses allow us to quantify the
impact of age-related vestibular declines on falls as well as the impact of age-related vestibular declines on age-
related balance declines. For example, we have recently reported that nearly 50% of cross-sectional age-related
balance declines found using a standard Romberg test variant (“eyes closed; standing on foam”) are mediated
by an age-related increase in roll tilt thresholds, suggesting that a single sub-clinical facet of vestibular function
is a substantial contributor to age-related balance declines. Furthermore, an analysis of over 5,000 Americans
showed that individuals who failed to complete this same balance test condition had significantly increased odds
to have reported “difficulty with falling” in the past 12 months (odds ratio of 6.3). We propose to build upon these
findings to quantify the multiple links between aging, vestibular function, balance, and falls. We posit the following
links: (i) vestibular function declines with age, (ii) these age-related vestibular declines impact balance, (iii)
imbalance contributes to falls, and (iv) falls cause death and injuries. Specifically, we posit that correlations
between aging, vestibular function, and balance arise, in part, because vestibular imprecision (i.e., vestibular
thresholds or vestibular “noise”) increases with age as demonstrated by large increases in vestibular thresholds
above the age of 40. Increased vestibular imprecision, in turn, contributes to instability, which contributes to falls.
To quantify these correlations and hypothesized causal links, we propose comprehensive assays of vestibular
function, broad multi-faceted balance assays, as well as reports of falls. We also propose to further develop and
test candidate interventions designed to improve tilt thresholds (“vestibular precision”), which could also improve
balance and reduce falls. Given life-or-death significance and broad impact, we propose:
 Aim 1: To quantify the links between age, vestibular function, balance, and falls in healthy individuals using
a comprehensive vestibular function test battery, broad multi-faceted balance tests, & fall-related surveys.
 Aim 2: To quantify both tilt thresholds and balance before and after a training intervention that has subjects
performing a standard tilt threshold task, except that feedback (“correct” or ”incorrect”) is provided after each
trial. This task is designed to improve vestibular thresholds (“precision”), which may also improve balance. For
Aim 2A, we propose to test young adults (age 18-40). For Aim 2B, we propose to test older adults (age 65-89).
 Aim 1 will quantify links between vestibular function and falls for the first time and will also quantify new links
between vestibular function and balance. This will define potential vestibular and/or balance tests that can be
used as screening tests to determine who would benefit from intervention. Aim 2 will quantify the impacts of a
training paradigm designed to reduce tilt thresholds. This will develop and test an intervention designed to
improve vestibular precision, which could also improve balance and reduce falls."
11032548,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein arginine methylation catalyzed by Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is of
intense current interest as an anti-cancer therapeutic target, as well as a mediator of lung, kidney,
neurodegenerative and cardiovascular pathologies. To date, the majority of studies
characterizing the consequences of PRMT1-mediated protein methylation have not considered
the biochemical mechanisms by which PRMT1 activity is altered, which is pivotal in understanding
how PRMT1 participates in cellular homeostasis, the progression of the aforementioned disease
states, and in developing treatment protocols to control PRMT1-dependent cellular events. The
two hypotheses being tested in this project are: 1) changes in oligomeric state and site-specific
cysteine oxidation of the PRMT1 protein affect substrate targeting and activity, and 2) that a
cysteine residue in PRMT1 can be harnessed to create/upgrade isoform-specific PRMT1
inhibitors. In Aim 1, novel fluorescence-based biophysical methods will be used to characterize
the dynamics of PRMT1 oligomer formation in intact cells. Strategically designed variants of
PRMT1 which present as tetramers, dimers, or monomers will be used to identify binding and
catalytic differences in the targeting by each oligomer, aiding in the ongoing effort to understand
molecular recognition rules of PRMT1 for its substrates. The effect of sulfenylation at a cysteine
residue near the active site of PRMT1 will also be characterized, allowing for the development of
stable oxidized and reduced mimics of PRMT1 to be used as research tools in areas of human
health affected by oxidative stress. The objectives in Aim 1 are built upon initial in vitro findings
by the PI and are expected to apply to the long-term goal of characterizing mechanisms of
regulating PRMT1 activity in vivo. In Aim 2, the strategy of using a nucleophilic cysteine near the
active site of PRMT1 to enable covalent inhibition by adenosine derivatives will be explored. This
strategy would be a valuable way to salvage inhibitors that show a lack of isoform-specificity, but
otherwise perform well to inhibit PRMT activity. Covalent inhibitors represent a novel, rationale
avenue for developing PRMT1 drugs and research tools. Undergraduate and graduate
researchers with interests in future careers in biomedical research or medicine will be involved in
the project and receive training in experimental design and analysis, notebook keeping, scientific
writing and presentation."

Among the many social justice issues that our nation continues to confront, health disparities, especially
underrepresentation in the biomedical workforce remains one of the most tractable. The lack of representation
in the proportion of minorities, especially black men, who go on to obtain a STEM degree remains alarming.
Among the factors responsible for this lack of diversity are the switching out of STEM majors by the end of the
sophomore years and the challenging environments many URMs face at research intensive (R1) institutions.
Virginia Tech’s ESTEEMED (VT ESTEEMED) program will provide the foundation and tools necessary from
disciplines that include biological sciences, chemistry, biochemistry, math and statistics for our scholars to
succeed in obtaining their undergraduate degrees and pursuing graduate degrees in biomedical engineering. To
accomplish this broad goal of increasing diversity in the biomedical workforce, this revised VT ESTEEMED,
which addressed all the “minor weaknesses” in the “01,” will use program faculty and PIs with outstanding history
of research productivity, training and mentoring of students from diverse backgrounds. Specific Aims of the VT
ESTEEMED research education program are: 1. Recruit 8 entering Freshmen, each year, for a total of 32 to
become VT ESTEEMED scholars who will have the foundation necessary to succeed in getting a BS and
pursuing a graduate degree in biomedical engineering; 2. Create a bridge program that will provide a smooth
transition to college for VT ESTEEMED scholars and to help them develop a familiarity with the fundamentals of
biomedical science and the process of “entering research;”3. Provide a mentored research experience that will
enhance student learning and engagement that will also translate into academic retention and success; 4. Create
learning opportunities for ESTEEMED scholar-led developmental activities including literature review sessions,
research progress/status updates, and the cohosting of speakers; and 5. Engage ESTEEMED scholars in
summer activities that includes research training and the acquiring of skills that include communication including

Meeting reproductive health needs of women living with HIV (WLWH) is essential to help women prevent
unintended pregnancies, safely conceive, and eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT). Reproductive
life planning is complex for WLWH, who are faced with making decisions about antiretroviral treatment selections
and potential for drug interactions with contraceptive methods, planning for safe conception, and STI prevention.
While family planning (FP) use is high among WLWH, discontinuation of FP is common among women who
desire pregnancy prevention, and is an important driver of unmet need for FP and subsequent risk of unintended
pregnancy and adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Many programs in sub-Saharan Africa integrate
FP service delivery into routine HIV care, but HIV care providers face challenges with implementing these models
of care. HIV care providers may be ill equipped to ensure WLWH receive high-quality, rights’ based reproductive
health counseling and services due to lack time, training, resources, and skills. Prior studies on integrating FP
services into HIV care consistently cite implementation challenges. Mobile health technology may provide a low
cost solution to augment counseling services, strengthen health care systems, and alleviate demands on HIV
providers. We hypothesize that providing comprehensive counseling and two-way SMS communication,
will 1) improve delivery of integrated HIV and reproductive health care services, 2) reduce contraceptive
discontinuation rates, 3) be acceptable and feasible to implement, and 4) be cost-effective and contribute
to prevention MTCT efforts. We will adapt a unique two-way SMS platform (Mobile WACh) that combines
automated bulk SMS messaging and dialogue with a health care provider for a new population, new
environment, and new outcomes for long-term impact. The Mobile WACh platform will be customized to
provide continuous reproductive life planning counseling for WLWH. We will test the combined intervention in a
cluster randomized controlled trial among women receiving HIV care at 10 facilities in Kenya (330 per facility).
We propose to evaluate the effect of the counseling and SMS communication intervention, Mobile WACh
Empower, on reproductive health outcomes. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of the Mobile WACh
Empower intervention on FP discontinuation, dual method use, and unmet need for FP over 2 years. In Aim 2,
we will evaluate acceptability, feasibility, and scalability of implementing Mobile WACh Empower under real-
world settings, from both WLWH and provider perspectives in focus group discussions. In Aim 3, we will construct
a mathematical model to measure health and economic impacts of Mobile WACh Empower, including cost-
effectiveness of the intervention per pregnancy and MTCT averted. This trial will evaluate a novel intervention to
address a crucial gap in provision of integrated reproductive health and HIV care, and has the potential to make
a significant contribution to global goals of universal access to FP and elimination of MTCT."

 Heart failure (HF) continues to be a leading cause of death, disability and health
care expenditures. Coronary artery disease culminating in a myocardial infarction (MI)
remains a major cause for HF. HF secondary to MI is fundamentally due to changes in
the structure and function of the left ventricle (LV) termed LV remodeling. In pathological
remodeling such as cancer, the proliferation of an aggressive degradative cell type, the
cancer associated fibroblast emerges. The cancer associated fibroblast alters normal
tissue structure through degradation/remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In
particular, a robust expression of a proteolytic enzyme, fibroblast activation protein (FAP).
We have identified that the post-MI fibroblast contains a very similar proteolytic signature
as the cancer associated fibroblast, in terms of ECM degradation and ultimately LV
remodeling. Accordingly, we will test the guiding hypothesis that FAP induction/activation
is essential for adverse post-MI remodeling and progression to HF and that specific
localized targeting of FAP within the MI region is feasible and effective. The outcome from
these translational studies will be to establish an entirely new therapeutic direction for
myocardial recovery following MI and prevention of HF. We have established a transgenic
line of FAP conditional knockout mice which will allow for FAP silencing following MI
induction as well as following the development of HF. We have developed unique
hydrogel formulations that allow for the release of small molecule therapeutics and
protease inhibitors, which have been deployed in our pig model post-MI using a minimally
invasive approach. The deliverables from this project will be to establish a novel
therapeutic direction for the prevention as well as the treatment for HF secondary to MI
through both temporal and localized control of FAP activation. These results will move
the entire ECM field forward by establishing the role of the fibroblast in HF and open an
entirely new direction through harnessing novel molecular tools and therapeutics to target
specific cell phenotypes in this disease process."

Interactions between central nervous system (CNS)-resident cells are highly heterogeneous; astrocytes and
microglia nourish and protect neurons, while inflammatory subsets drive demyelination and neurodegeneration
in neurologic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms that control CNS-resident immune cell
interactions remain mostly unknown because methods for defining the specific cell types, pathways and
molecules involved are limited. In this project we apply two novel approaches that we developed to study
astrocyte-microglia interactions during inflammation: 1) an in vivo barcoded rabies tracing strategy that
analyzes cell connections and transcriptomes with single cell resolution, and 2) a droplet-based platform for
genome-wide, unbiased CRISPR/Cas9 screening of interacting cell pairs. These methods provide a unique
opportunity to study pathways used by CNS-resident immune cells to communicate with each other and control
inflammation and neurodegeneration. We propose to:
SPECIFIC AIM 1: Define the transcriptomes of single cells in pro-and anti-inflammatory networks. We
will simultaneously sequence connections and single cell transcriptomes of CNS cells in the experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). These studies will identify pro-
and anti-inflammatory cellular networks and the molecular mechanisms that regulate disease-relevant cell-cell
interactions within these networks.
SPECIFIC AIM 2: Identify novel astrocyte-microglia interactions using a droplet-based platform for
CRISPR/Cas9 forward genetic screens. We will perform unbiased genome-wide screens for genes that
participate in microglia-astrocyte crosstalk. We will co-incubate and microfluidically sort millions of picoliter
water-in-oil droplets containing single microglia harboring a CRISPR/Cas9 library mutation and single
astrocytes carrying a fluorescent reporter. Independent droplets do not mix, providing a powerful platform for
the identification of immune interactions mediated by cell surface and soluble molecules."
10828365,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Our goal is to establish a new framework for understanding the regulation of fetal growth. To do so,
we will demonstrate novel roles for fetal glucagon and maternal placental lactogen. Current dogma
holds that the mother's nutritional and hormonal status, uterine blood flow, and early events in
placental development regulate placental nutrient delivery and fetal growth. However, knowledge
gaps in this understanding have prevented progress towards successful treatment of disordered fetal
growth during complications of pregnancy. This proposal will show how fetal glucagon inhibits uterine
blood flow and placental nutrient delivery by inhibiting secretion of placental lactogen into the
maternal circulation. We have recently demonstrated that experimentally increasing fetal glucagon
concentrations with direct fetal glucagon infusions into late gestation fetal sheep lowers uterine blood,
placental uptake of nutrients and oxygen from the maternal circulation, placental delivery of amino
acids to the fetus, fetal plasma concentrations of amino acids, fetal plasma concentrations of the
anabolic growth factors insulin and IGF-1, and fetal protein accretion. These were associated with a
13% reduction in fetal weight after just a nine-day infusion. Additionally, we have demonstrated that
experimentally lowering placental lactogen in pregnant sheep results in lower uterine blood flow and
placental nutrient delivery independent of its classically described role in regulating maternal nutrient
metabolism. We have repeatedly shown that increasing fetal amino acids raises fetal glucagon
concentrations. Taken together, these data support our overarching hypothesis: fetal glucagon
matches placental nutrient delivery to fetal metabolic demand by inhibiting PL secretion. This
hypothesis will be tested in pregnant sheep, isolated human primary trophoblasts, and uterine and
myometrial arteries isolated from pregnant sheep and humans, respectively. In Aim #1 we will show
that the mechanism by which fetal glucagon inhibits fetal growth is by lowering placental amino acid
delivery and fetal amino acid concentrations. In Aim #2 we will demonstrate that the mechanism by
which fetal glucagon inhibits uterine blood flow and placental nutrient delivery is by lowering placental
lactogen secretion. In Aim #3 we will establish the mechanism by which glucagon inhibits placental
lactogen secretion. This proposal will be the first mechanistic physiological investigation into fetal
glucagon as an inhibitor of uterine blood flow, placental nutrient delivery, and fetal growth and
placental lactogen as a vasodilator in the uterine circulation. The impact will be to shift the paradigm
for our understanding of the regulation of fetal growth. This is required if we are to make new
advances into the management of disordered fetal growth in pregnancies complicated by placental
insufficiency, preeclampsia, diabetes, maternal obesity and other conditions."
10932842,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to evaluate a novel αvβ6 integrin molecularly targeted theranostic approach for the detection and
treatment of metastatic cancers. The αvβ6 integrin is a cell surface receptor that is low or undetectable in normal
adult epithelium but is widely expressed on numerous carcinomas. There is a statistically significant association
between the high expression of the αvβ6 integrin, distant spread, and poor survival. We previously developed
an αvβ6 -Binding Peptide (BP) with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity for the integrin αvβ66. Our prior clinical
data demonstrates that using [18F]-αvβ6 -BP PET/CT imaging we can detect both primary tumors and
metastases. PET images showed low background uptake in normal brain, lungs, liver, and osseous skeleton
which are common sites of metastatic disease. Furthermore, sub-centimeter metastases to these organs were
detected using [18F]αvβ6 -BP PET/CT. We further developed our αvβ6-BP into a novel theranostic pair, [68Ga]Ga
DOTA-5G and [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G in which [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G is being developed as a diagnostic and
[177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G is being developed as a radiotherapy. We now propose a prospective clinical trial to
test the [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G and [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G in patients with metastatic disease. Patients will
undergo [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G PET/CT scans to confirm eligibility for the [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G therapy and
follow up [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G PET/CT scans to evaluate treatment response. We hypothesize that a) [68Ga]Ga
DOTA-5G will detect lesions in patients with metastatic cancers b) the theranostic pair [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G/
[177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G will be safe and well tolerated; and c) a therapeutic response will be achieved with a
single dose of [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G. This proposal leverages the complimentary expertise of Dr. Sutcliffe to
develop and translate the theranostic agents, and Dr. Foster to treat patients and interpret images for treatment
response. The ability of the Sutcliffe lab to generate the theranostic agents in this study for patients treated at
UC Davis maximizes existing resources and a well-established successful collaboration between the PIs,
increasing the speed of translation of these theranostic agents from research to Phase II trials and ultimately, a
standard of care option for patients with metastatic disease. Given the role of the αvβ6 integrin receptor in the
processes of invasion and metastasis, αvβ6 is a very attractive target for the detection and treatment of metastatic
cancers and could have broad impact across multiple cancers. [68Ga]Ga DOTA-5G will more accurately and
non-invasively detect disease and the promising pharmacokinetic profile of the theranostics proposed suggests
that off-target toxicity of this [177Lu]Lu DOTA-ABM-5G therapy is not expected. This poses a major improvement
over current treatments that are known to cause bone marrow toxicity, hepatobiliary toxicity, and cardiotoxicity.
Collectively, this proposal will significantly help transform cancer treatment for patients with advanced disease."
10814313,"Understanding the role of malleable epigenetic mechanisms in birth defects is a direct path to prevention
strategies. Orofacial clefts (OFCs) of the lip and palate are among the most common human structural birth
defects, affecting 1 in 800 newborns, and pose serious individual, familial, and societal burdens. Prevention
strategies for OFCs are elusive because our current understanding of causative factors is inadequate.
Epidemiologic and traditional genetic studies have shown that OFCs are etiologically complex outcomes that
result from multifactorial genetic and environmental influences. Epigenetic mechanisms are an exciting new
focus in understanding the genesis of OFCs because they mediate the effect of environmental influences on the
genome during sensitive embryonic periods. Our proposal specifically focuses on DNA methylation because
this epigenetic mechanism is environmentally sensitive and a practical target of prevention and therapeutic
strategies. While implicated by multiple lines of evidence, the biological role of DNA methylation in orofacial
development is unclear. We have established novel models and generated key proofs of concepts that poise us
to uncover how DNA methylation regulates orofacial morphogenesis and to define the role that DNA
methylation plays in modulating OFC susceptibility. In this project, integrated genome-wide methylation and
bulk and single-cell transcriptome approaches will be applied to define molecular and cellular mechanisms of
OFC pathogenesis resulting from disrupted DNA methylation in the cranial neural crest. The role of DNA
methylation in multifactorial OFC susceptibility will then be defined by integrating multiple environmental and
dietary modulators of DNA methylation to genetic (Wnt9b KO) and chemical (Shh antagonist) mouse models
of incompletely penetrant OFCs. Finally, epigenome editing will be applied to evaluate the functional impact of
OFC-associated methylation changes on gene expression and cranial neural crest biology. Completion of the
proposed studies will bring fundamental insight into how DNA methylation regulates cranial neural crest
biology and orofacial morphogenesis. By defining environmental- and dietary-mediated methylome-
transcriptome responses that alter OFC susceptibility, these studies will also provide a necessary foundation for
identification of environmental influences that modulate DNA methylation and contribute to OFC risk.
Pursuing this line of investigation will advance our long-term goal of developing prevention strategies for
etiologically complex birth defects by identifying culpable environmental influences and defining their
mechanisms of action."

Our long-term goal is to understand how dynamic regulation of signal transduction systems control cellular
stress responses. The focus of this proposal is on identifying the mechanisms by which dynamic
expression of the transcription factors p53 and MYC coordinately regulate apoptosis and senescence in
response to genotoxic stress. Proper regulation of p53 and MYC are of undeniable importance in human
health, as their mutation predisposes human cells to cancer. While the regulation and functions of p53 and
MYC have been extensively studied, exactly how they generate variable cell fate outcomes in individual
cells of a population responding to the same stress remains poorly understood. Our recent studies have
shown that the dynamics of p53, the temporal pattern of p53 accumulation and degradation, serves an
integral function for controlling MYC levels and cell fate responses to DNA damage. We have shown p53
dynamics to be highly variable between individual cells, but it remains to be determined how such variability
contributes to heterogeneous responses to DNA damaging agents, which is critical for understanding
tumor cell heterogeneity and evasion of therapies. To answer this question, we will combine time-lapse
fluorescence microscopy to quantify p53 and MYC dynamics with quantitative analysis of key
transcriptional targets at the single cell level to determine the temporal regulation of the triggering of
apoptosis and senescence in response to DNA damage. We will apply this analysis to three conditions: 1.)
non-transformed cells expressing normal p53 and MYC, 2.) transformed cells in which MYC expression is
elevated over a range of concentrations, and 3.) transformed cells expressing a p53 gain-of-function
hotspot mutation. This work will show how p53 and MYC dynamics control initiation of terminal cell fates
in physiological and pathological conditions, and it will serve as the basis for approaches to reduce
heterogeneous responses to DNA damaging compounds. These results will provide novel insight into the
basic functioning of one of the most important stress response pathways in human cells, and are likely to
inform innovative therapeutic strategies based on improved timing of the delivery of therapies. More
broadly, this study is likely to provide general insights into the growing list of other important signaling
pathways that use dynamic regulation."
10840464,"Project Summary
The neuromodulators acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) play important roles in learning. In the striatum
cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are modulated co-incident with the release of DA in response to unpredicted
rewards and reward predicting cues and both signals have been implicated in coding prediction error signals.
Whereas DA neurons are mostly activated by these salient events, CINs often show a multiphasic response with
a prominent pause in activity. The time locked occurrence of both signals suggest that they are coordinated but
it is still unclear whether they are regulated independently from each other or whether they mutually regulate
each other. Moreover, whether their temporal co-incidence is important for learning still needs to be determined.
Support for a mutual co-regulation comes from both stimulation and lesion studies. In the slice, DA released from
DA terminals inhibits the activity of CINs via activation of D2 receptors. Strikingly, classical 6-OHDA lesion
studies in non-human primates suggest that the pause in Tonically Active Neurons (TANs), the primate
counterparts of CINs, is fully dependent on DA; although this hypothesis has been challenged by data implicating
thalamic or other projections in the pause generation. Slice physiology and in vivo stimulations studies have
further shown that ACh released from CINs locally induces DA release. One limitation of stimulation studies is
that they do not measure naturally evoked ACh or DA levels. Thus, the importance of this mutual co-regulation
during learning must be determined under natural conditions. An ideal way to achieve this is to simultaneously
measure behaviorally-evoked changes in DA and ACh levels in the same animal. Since striatal ACh has been
found to be important when behavior needs to be adapted to new task rules the application will focus on
understanding the importance of the mutual co-regulation of DA and ACh for cognitive flexibility. To this end, we
propose to simultaneously record task-evoked DA and ACh transients in the mouse during two flexible learning
behaviors, Go/NoGo and reversal learning. Our preliminary data show that both behaviors are affected by striatal
CIN function. We then will isolate the DA-dependent component of the ACh signal by enhancing or abolishing
the ability of DA to inhibit CINs. Conversely, we will abolish the ability of CINs to release ACh or inhibit CIN
activity with high temporal resolution. Determining how these manipulations affect task-evoked changes in
ACh/DA levels and performance will establish the importance of mutual co-regulation of DA and ACh signals for
flexible learning. Our studies will provide mechanistic insights into DA and ACh co-regulation in the striatum.
This has clinical relevance as both neurotransmitters are dysregulated in the striatum of patients with brain
disorders including schizophrenia and Parkinson disorder, where both neuromodulator systems are targeted by
current therapeutic treatments."

This K99 Career Pathway to Independence in Blood Science Award details a five-year training program to
advance Dr. Bhavya Doshi’s career goal of becoming an independent translational physician-scientist in
coagulation. The proposed application combines approaches using tissue culture and animal models with
investigations using patient samples to address the current limitations in the understanding of the immune
response to factor VIII (FVIII). Dr. Doshi’s career development and training objectives are geared to foster this
research proposal and her overall career goal of understanding basic mechanisms that drive disease to
develop targeted treatment and prevention strategies. During the award period, Dr. Doshi will engage with a
robust team of scientists in hemostasis and immunology to build her immunologic and translational research
skills, learn genomic skills necessary for her future career aspirations, and continue to develop her expertise in
coagulation and inhibitors. Under the guidance of her mentors, Dr. Rodney Camire and Dr. Michael Milone,
these training objectives will be met by a combination of didactic course work and workshops, participation in
seminar series, hands-on research experience, and mentoring by her advisory committee. Her advisory
committee is composed of world-renowned scientists with extensive mentoring experience and diverse and
complementary scientific expertise. They are all versed in bringing basic research findings to the bedside.
Hemophilia A (HA) is caused by a mutation in the F8 gene leading to dysfunction or deficiency of coagulation
FVIII. The development of neutralizing antibodies (“inhibitors”) to FVIII is the leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in patients with HA. Dr. Doshi’s preliminary studies in HA patients and mice are the first to support
that the cytokine B cell activating factor (BAFF) is potentially a biomarker and/or regulator of the FVIII immune
response. This proposal seeks to probe basic mechanisms in FVIII-specific B cell generation and how BAFF
contributes to this humoral response in order to leverage these findings for therapeutic application. Aim 1
seeks to determine the location, kinetics, and types of B cell responses to FVIII in mice by using a novel
method to identify FVIII-specific B cells and subsequently determine what happens to this compartment with
immunomodulatory strategies, including anti-BAFF. As BAFF is both systemically and locally produced by
fibroblast cells and hematopoietically-derived immune cells, respectively, Aim 2 investigates the source of
BAFF and its effect on the T cell response to FVIII. Finally, Aim 3 assesses whether genetic drivers of cytokine
levels for BAFF or T helper cytokines drive phenotypic changes in T and B cell subsets that lead to inhibitor
generation and/or persistence in HA patients. Together, these studies will inform the immune compartments
that are critical to the FVIII immune response and establish the preclinical data to translate anti-BAFF therapy
to the clinics. The research and career objectives in this proposal will bolster Dr. Doshi’s research repertoire to
enable her transition to an independent physician scientist focused on blood disorders, specifically hemophilia."

Dr. Junichi Ishigami, MD, MPH seeks a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in order to obtain
essential skills and mentored research experience to become an independent investigator in the field of
implementation research to improve the uptake of influenza vaccination among individuals with chronic kidney
disease (CKD). The research proposal details a five-year plan consisting of implementation research to
improve the uptake of influenza vaccination among individuals with CKD, and advanced coursework at the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health under the combined mentorship of Dr. Kunihiro Matsushita,
MD, PhD, and Dr. David Dowdy, MD, PhD. Influenza affects 10-35 million individuals annually in the US,
resulting in up to 710,000 hospitalizations and 56,000 deaths. Vaccination against influenza is especially
important for individuals with CKD due to their high risk of influenza complications (e.g., pneumonia,
cardiovascular disease). Yet, we have recently reported that ~40% of adults aged ≥65 years with non-dialysis
dependent CKD in the US did not get an influenza vaccine and the vaccination rate has not improved between
2005 and 2015. This indicates that additional efforts are urgently needed to improve the uptake of influenza
vaccination particularly in this high risk population. However, no evidence-based implementation strategies
exist to improve the uptake of influenza vaccination specifically among individuals with CKD. The proposed
project will address this public health concern. The specific aims of this research proposal are 1) To determine
patient and provider perceptions about influenza vaccination in nephrology care, 2) To design a theory-based
vaccination program and test its feasibility in nephrology care, and 3) To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a
theory-based vaccination program in nephrology care. To address these issues, we will leverage the Chronic
Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC), an NIDDK-funded, ethnically-diverse, well-documented, contemporary,
longitudinal cohort of 5,499 persons aged 21-74 years at baseline with a variety of CKD stages. This project
will inform implementation strategies to enhance an effective influenza vaccine delivery in CKD, provide proof
of concept of promoting influenza vaccination in nephrology care, and provide information on the cost-
effectiveness of a theory-based vaccination program for decision-making on resource utilization. Together, this
project will pave a theoretical foundation for developing cost-effective and feasible vaccination programs for
individuals with CKD, which can be further extended under other funding mechanisms such as an R01. This
project will make the candidate fully equipped to be an independent investigator and also will provide an
evidence base for improving influenza vaccine uptake in CKD, an understudied and important clinical priority in
nephrology care."

This project addresses AHRQ’s two Special Emphasis Notices on advancing primary care research and health
equity (NOT-HS-22-011 and NOT-HS-21-014). Both sexual and racial/ethnic minority populations make up a
significant and growing share of the U.S. population. Both populations experience higher rates of delayed
health care, unmet care needs, and poorer quality of care than their respective majority counterparts. However,
while prior studies have attempted to identify key factors leading to health care disadvantages in either
population, they often overlook how the intersection of minoritized sexual orientation and race/ethnicity may
complicate utilization of and barriers to care. Despite increasing research on sexual health care among Black
and Hispanic sexual minority men, primary care experiences across Asian, Black, and Hispanic sexual minority
women and men have not been systematically examined due primarily to data limitations. Guided by the
framework of intersectionality and Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, this project aims to: (1)
comprehensively document inequities in primary care utilization among sexual minority people of color in
comparison to their heterosexual and White counterparts, and (2) identify unique mechanisms underlying the
inequities facing each disadvantaged group.
We will break new ground in understanding primary care inequities at the intersection of sexual orientation and
race/ethnicity by analyzing two large population-based datasets from the National Health Interview Survey
(2013-20) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2014-20). These datasets have adequate
sample sizes for studying sexual minority groups of color, rich information on health care experiences, and
comparable measures for factors of health care utilization and sociodemographic characteristics. They also
complement each other in their survey designs and health care measurements. Power analysis indicates that
the samples of sexual minority people of color are sufficiently large to detect small effects at power>0.8. We
will use multiple regression analyses and the Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition approach to assess
primary care inequities and multifaceted pathways linked to the inequities.
Overall impact. This project will provide the first systematic and population-based analysis of primary care
inequities and their underlying mechanisms at the intersection of race/ethnicity and sexual orientation. It will
elucidate unique primary care challenges faced by sexual minority people of color, an underserved and
understudied population that experiences significant and persistent health disadvantages. Findings will inform
clinical practices, medical education, and policy designs of effective interventions to reduce health care
inequities, a major goal of AHRQ. More broadly, the project will advance the understanding and application of
intersectionality in health care research."
10813708,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The recent development of potent immunosuppressive regimens has led to decreased incidence of acute
rejection and increased incidence of non-rejection complications, including recurrent immune-mediated
glomerular diseases (GD) which have emerged as leading causes of kidney allograft failure.
IgA nephropathy (IgAN), membranous nephropathy (MN), and diffuse podocytopathy (DP) are the most common
causes of primary GD in the native kidney and these same GD can recur after transplantation. In the native
kidney, it is apparent that immune and genetic factors are important contributors to each of these GD.
Although little is known about the pathogenesis of recurrent GD after transplantation, few studies have shown
that rigorous donor-recipient HLA matching and steroid-free immunosuppressive regimens are risk factors for
recurrent GD. Therefore, we hypothesized that, similar to GD in the native kidney, recurrent GD are mediated
by genomic and immune factors. To define the role of genomic and immune factors in recurrent IgAN, MN, and
DP, we have begun collecting clinical data, DNA from donor-recipient pairs, recipients’ sera, and kidney allograft
biopsies from multiple transplant centers to assemble the largest cohort of transplant patients with recurrent and
non-recurrent GD (n=1,035 at least). To ensure adequate power and eliminate the need for replication studies,
we are using genetic risk scores (GRS) and serologic studies that has been previously validated in the native
kidney. Hence, we developed a research plan composed of three aims that follow parallel approaches.
In Specific Aim-1, we will (1) use genome wide SNP arrays to genotype donor-recipient pairs in patients with
recurrent and non-recurrent IgAN, generate individual 30-SNP IgAN GRS, and test these GRS as predictors of
recurrent disease, (2) test the values of pre-transplant serum levels of galactose-deficient IgA1, IgG anti-glycan
antibodies (Ab), and combined IgAN risk scores (which integrate the IgAN GRS with the above pre-transplant
serum levels) as predictors for recurrent disease, and (3) compare transcriptomic profiling of different post-
transplantation GD to identify immune signals specific for recurrent IgAN.
In Specific Aim-2, we will test donor and recipient MN GRS, anti-phospholipase A2 receptor Ab, and combined
MN risk scores as predictors for recurrent MN, and identify intra-graft immune signals specific for recurrent MN.
In Specific Aim-3, we will test the values of donor and recipient DP GRS and anti-nephrin Ab as predictors for
recurrent DP, and use transcriptomic profiling to identify immune signals specific for recurrent disease.
Health relatedness of the project: The proposed project will integrate the field of transplantation with novel donor
screening technologies and immune monitoring. In the short-term, this proposal promises to define predictors of
these relatively rare but clinically relevant recurrent GD. In the long-term, this project has the potential to
introduce novel genomic donor-recipient matching and immune monitoring for patients with kidney failure
secondary to GD to decrease incidence of recurrent GD, and improve the health of kidney transplant recipients."
10825563,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Metastatic breast cancer (BC) remains largely resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy.
Tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (TINs) with immunosuppressive activity represent a major component in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) to drive immunotherapy resistance. Therapeutic debilitation of immunosuppressive
TINs is a promising approach to elicit synergistic efficacy when combined with immunotherapy. However,
therapeutic targeting of TINs faces challenges in selectivity and safety, highlighted by the lack of TIN-specific
targets. Recently, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to compare TINs and circulating neutrophils in BC models
and identified aconitate decarboxylase 1 (Acod1) to be uniquely upregulated in TINs. Acod1 catalyzes the
production of itaconate, a metabolite with anti-inflammatory activity in macrophages. But Acod1 function in
neutrophils is poorly defined. Our preliminary results in BC mouse models suggest that TINs rely on Acod1 to
sustain survival in the TME, and Acod1 loss leads to reduced TIN infiltration and metastasis. There are still
significant knowledge gaps about the function, mechanism and therapeutic potential of Acod1 in TINs.
 Our central hypothesis is that Acod1 upregulated in TINs that infiltrate metastatic BC is essential for the
TINs to persist in the TME and exert the immunosuppressive function, thus Acod1 ablation debilitates TINs,
favors anti-tumor immunity, and sensitizes metastatic BC to immunotherapy. We propose to accomplish three
Specific Aims: (Aim 1) Validate the pro-metastasis function of Acod1 in TINs in syngeneic and spontaneous
murine mammary tumor models. (Aim 2) Identify the upstream and downstream molecular mechanisms
underlying the upregulation and function of Acod1 in TINs. (Aim 3) Improve metastatic BC response to
immunotherapy by Acod1 ablation and validate ACOD1 expression in clinical samples.
 To achieve our research goals, we have developed both whole-body and neutrophil-specific Acod1
knockout mice as hosts for BC syngeneic models, both mouse and human in vitro cell models of TINs, single-
cell technologies for gene profiling and immune cell phenotyping, injection techniques that generate mammary
tumors and metastases to lung and bone in the mice, and multiplex immunofluorescence staining techniques
suitable for validation studies using clinical samples. We have assembled a strong research team with
complementary expertise, which further ensures that the studies proposed are highly feasible to accomplish.
 Upon completion of the project, we expect to uncover the previous unknown function and mechanism of
Acod1 in immunosuppressive TINs that are enriched in BC metastases, provide novel links between metabolic
rewiring and immunoregulatory function of TINs, and generate the key preclinical evidence for targeting Acod1
to improve immunotherapy. In the long term, we envision that the bench-to-bedside translation of our findings
through development of Acod1 inhibitors may accelerate the therapeutic application of combining agents that
reprogram immunometabolism and immunotherapeutics to the curative treatment of BC and other cancers."

be harnessed for the photoreceptor, retinal, or ocular cells then there is potential for nucleic acid drugs
(injectable EhhRzs) as therapeutics without vector-based gene therapy, for diverse ocular diseases and
inherited retinal degenerations. Recent clinical success with intravitreal injection of antisense agents
incentivizes this development. The objective is to optimize EhhRzs for intracellular performance in cultured
human cells and mouse photoreceptor cells that are “humanized” for RHO mRNAs (same targets as in clinical
trials). The central hypothesis is that optimization of EhhRz kinetic performance and delivery will maximize
target mRNA/protein KD; optimization requires quantitation of biophysical variables that underlie target: EhhRz
interaction, rational and/or evolutionary engineering of RNA structure-related function, and identification of the
optimum delivery materials and approach. Our rationale is that EhhRzs can be optimized through synthetic
chemistry and/or natural modifications, while retaining or enhancing kinetic function, to support robust
intracellular KD. Treatment occurs through vector-mediated delivery (AAV) of expression constructs, or direct
delivery of synthetic EhhRz therapeutics (injectables). To test the central hypothesis the Specific Aims are:
Aim 1. Optimize current EhhRzs at lead hRHO target sites (266 CUC, 725 GUC, 1362 GUC) for rate
enhancement, cellular stability, target-colocalization, and knockdown performance. Aim 2. Optimize
EhhRz Knockdown strategy for: (i) rescue (efficacy) of retinal degeneration and (ii) lack of toxicity with
AAV-EhhRz gene therapy and injectable synthetic EhhRzs in transgenic mouse models humanized for
RHO. Innovation occurs through optimization of EhhRz design, and optimization of strategies for therapeutic
delivery in a humanized adRP model. Significance- The study optimizes EhhRz function and delivery as
an initial step toward a KD/RECON rescue strategy for dominant photoreceptor degenerations."
10848253,"Black and Hispanic adults suffer disproportionately from obesity and obesity-related conditions (e.g.,
Hispanic/White ratio: diabetes (1.7) compared to their white counterparts. While behavioral weight loss (WL)
interventions are the first line in treating obesity, they have mixed outcomes. Most fail to make a persistent
impact, especially in specific racial/ethnic subgroups. For example, Black women lose 50% less weight than their
white counterparts, even when enrolled in fully powered, well-designed behavioral WL trials. One plausible
reason for these sub-optimal results is a focus on behavior change at the individual level alone while neglecting
critical social and environmental forces. Social networks have been increasingly shown to influence health
behaviors, yet they have seldom been harnessed in studies targeting weight loss, especially among racial/ethnic
minorities. In response to PAS-20-160 Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the Mission
of NIDDK, this application will compare the effects of a social-network enhanced lifestyle intervention (hereafter
termed ""ROBUST"" Reducing OBesity Using Social Ties) to an individual level lifestyle intervention (control) on
modifying multiple network-level barriers to weight loss. We will randomly enroll 132 Black or Hispanic adults
with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) and invite up to two social network members of participants in the ROBUST arm
to a 24 –week multi-competent lifestyle intervention. We will evaluate whether the ROBUST intervention not
only addresses individual-level behaviors (i.e., healthy eating, increased physical activity) but also: 1) reduces
social undermining as well as changes perceived health norms by activating communal coping - a behavioral
process that involves thinking, communicating, and acting as if a health risk (i.e., Type 2 diabetes) is shared;
and 2) dampens the harmful effects of increased interpersonal conflict on weight by teaching participants how to
induce a positive affect and self-affirming mindset which we have shown in a previous trial (NHLBI-U01HL07843)
prevents unwanted weight gain. Participants in the control arm will receive the same number of lifestyle sessions
as those randomized to ROBUST. But, their social network will not be directly engaged in the study. We
hypothesize that the ROBUST intervention will satisfy all a priori feasibility/acceptability criteria for recruitment,
retention, and study conduct. Additionally, the ROBUST intervention will result in positive changes in multiple
barriers to behavior change, leading to a more significant proportion of participants experiencing improvements
in diet, physical activity, and weight loss at 24 weeks compared to the control group. If proven effective, the
preliminary data gathered from this small RO1 will support a fully powered RCT that will result in an optimized
multi-level obesity intervention that impacts critical clinical endpoints (i.e., BMI, insulin resistance, and
hemoglobin A1c) in a population at very high risk of poor outcomes related to obesity and its metabolic sequelae."
10814325,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: The homeless population is aging, with an increasing proportion of individuals over age 50 who
experience accelerated aging, high rates of mortality, and a high risk of not having their wishes honored at the
end of life. Advance care planning (ACP) aims to elicit patients’ medical preferences; yet older homeless adults
have low rates of ACP. Significant policy attention has focused on rehousing chronically homeless people into
Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), subsidized permanent housing with voluntary supportive services. Our
previous research indicates that PSH may be the ideal setting to initiate ACP; however, no studies have
engaged formerly homeless PSH residents in ACP. Our team has created PREPARE for Your Care
(PREPARE) – an easy-to-use, evidence-based, online ACP program with video stories. This program includes
easy-to-read advance directives, an ACP group visit guide, and an ACP one-on-one facilitation guide. Through
a prior R34, we developed a Community Advisory Board (CAB) and together identified preliminary adaptations
to PREPARE for the PSH setting. The project requires a final co-development process with formerly chronically
homeless older PSH residents and staff and our CAB. The objective of this proposal is to co-develop
PREPARE-PSH and compare the effectiveness of facilitated group versus one-on-one visits among formerly
chronically homeless older adults in PSH. Aims: We will (1) co-develop PREPARE-PSH with PSH residents,
staff, and our CAB; (2) conduct a Hybrid (NIH Stage III efficacy/effectiveness), Type 1, two-arm, cluster
randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of two delivery strategies of the PREPARE-PSH program (i.e.,
ACP movies and easy-to-read ADs) – facilitated group vs. one-on-one visits; and (3) explore implementation-
relevant factors associated with ACP engagement and sustainability of ACP in PSH. Methods: In Aim 1 we will
engage in a rigorous co-development process through in-depth interviews and focus groups with 20 PSH
residents and the CAB. We will use a theory-informed framework (i.e., Behavior Change Wheel (BCW)) and
qualitative content analysis to co-create a PREPARE-PSH program. For Aim 2, the CAB noted that groups
may be more feasible to scale vs. one-on-one visits and asked us to randomize by site so residents would not
feel “left out” of the alternate intervention. Therefore, we will conduct a Hybrid (NIH Stage III
efficacy/effectiveness), Type 1 cluster randomized trial comparing delivery of PREPARE-PSH through
facilitated groups vs. one-on-one visits using mixed effects models. Randomization will be at the site level,
balanced by site size. In Aim 3 we will purposively sample Aim 2 participants for in-depth interviews (n=40-50),
conduct focus groups with PSH staff (n=40), and obtain input from CAB members (total n=15). We will explore
implementation-relevant factors associated with: (a) high and low ACP engagement and sustainability of
PREPARE-PSH using the BCW and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) model.
Relevance to NIH and public health: PREPARE-PSH may reduce health disparities in ACP among formerly
chronically homeless older adults."

Over 1 million women have their labor induced in the United States each year, and synthetic oxytocin infusion
is the most common method used. However, compared to spontaneous labor, medical induction is resource-
intensive, has increased obstetric risks, and is associated with less successful breastfeeding. In contrast to
endogenous oxytocin hormone which is released in a pulsatile fashion in the brain, synthetic oxytocin is
continuously infused intravenously, resulting in important limitations related to efficacy, safety, and cost.
Akin to spontaneous labor contractions, infant suckling of the breast nipple is known to stimulate the pulsatile
release of endogenous oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland. Nipple stimulation therapy via electric
breast pump similarly stimulates endogenous oxytocin release, and our preliminary work shows that it is a
feasible and acceptable inpatient method that results in a desirable uterine contraction patter n in nulliparas.
Our pilot study of 100 randomized nulliparas showed that intrapartum nipple stimulation therapy decreases
labor duration and trends toward a significant increase in the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery compared
to synthetic oxytocin infusion. Further, nipple stimulation reduced the dose and duration of synthetic oxytocin
even when adjunctive synthetic oxytocin was used. Therefore, nipple stimulation therapy will likely prove to
be an efficacious labor induction method that increases the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery, and
also have added physiologic benefits. For example, nipple stimulation triggers lactation by inducing the milk
ejection reflex, and our preliminary work also shows that nipple stimulation therapy via electric breast pump
results in early colostrum production and milk letdown in the majority of women, including first-time mothers.
Earlier lactation would alleviate the most common reasons for early breastfeeding discontinuation by
improving maternal perception of insufficient milk supply and the severity of weight loss that occurs in infants
in the first few days of life as they establish feeding. This in turn would improve the likelihood of sustained
breastfeeding for the recommended 6 months, which also has many short- and long-term benefits.
Consequently, nipple stimulation therapy during labor has tremendous potential public health and cost
benefits, and its success would be particularly important in areas of poverty, including developing countries.
We propose a multicenter randomized trial at Yale and Northwestern Universities to compare inpatient
nipple stimulation therapy via electric breast pump versus immediate synthetic oxytocin infusion without
nipple stimulation for nulliparous women undergoing labor induction. This trial of 988 nulliparous women will
provide adequate statistical significance to detect clinically meaningful differences in delivery mode and
breastmilk as the sole source of nutrition for newborns. Successful completion of this proposal will provide
rigorous data to help us show how this novel and potentially cost-effective method can radically change the
way we induce labor and positively impact breastfeeding success and early infant nutrition through lactation."

 High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most common and deadly subtype of ovarian cancer.
An oncogenic driver and therapeutic target in HGSC is DNA replication stress (RS). The cellular RS response
includes several proteins under investigation as therapeutic targets. Characterization of the oncogenic role of
proteins that function in the RS response, and their development as therapeutic targets, will impact HGSC
treatment approaches. In this context, RAD9, RAD1, and HUS1 Interacting Nuclear Orphan (RHNO1) plays an
important role in the HGSC RS response. RHNO1 interacts with the RAD9-RAD1-HUS1 complex (9-1-1) to
promote ATR-CHK1 signaling, homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, cell survival, and chemotherapy
resistance. RHNO1 is commonly overexpressed in HGSC, including in recurrent chemoresistant disease.
RHNO1 knockout (KO) in normal fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells does not impair cell viability, suggesting
that drugs targeting RHNO1 function will have a high therapeutic index. Here, we will investigate the role of
RHNO1 in HGSC in vivo and will identify first-in-class inhibitors of the RHNO1 interaction with the 9-1-1 complex.
Our overarching goal is to develop a new therapeutic approach for HGSC.
 Specific Aim 1. Determine the role of RHNO1 in HGSC in vivo using orthotopic xenografting.
Orthotopic xenografting is an in vivo approach to determine oncogene function in the context of a human tumor.
We will ablate RHNO1 using CRISPR KO in two human HGSC cells lines, OVCAR4 and OVCAR8, that model
metastatic, recurrent disease in vivo. We will implant luciferase-tagged cells intraperitoneally (IP) into athymic
nude mice, as the peritoneal cavity is the orthotopic site that mimics late stage and recurrent HGSC most relevant
for therapeutic development. In Sub-Aim 1A, we will measure tumor growth kinetics using imaging, as well as
mouse survival, metastatic growth, and ascites. In Sub-Aim 1B, we will measure biomarkers of proliferation, the
RS response, DNA damage, and apoptosis. In Sub-Aim 1C, we will determine the sensitivity of RHNO1 KO and
control xenografts to carboplatin or olaparib chemotherapy, agents which have high therapeutic relevance for
HGSC.
 Specific Aim 2. Develop first-in-class compounds that disrupt the RHNO1/9-1-1 interaction. There
are no small molecule inhibitors (SMI) of RHNO1 function. Here, we will develop validated RHNO1 mimics that
disrupt the RHNO1/9-1-1 interaction and the RS response in HGSC cells, which is expected to inhibit HGSC cell
survival. In Sub-Aim 2A, we will conduct a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign using a 100,000
compound in-house chemical library and a newly developed 9-1-1/RHNO1 fluorescence polarization (FP) assay.
In Sub-Aim 2B, we will test the identified hits using an available FP-based counter screen. In Sub-Aim 2C, we
will subject hits in complex with 9-1-1 to X-ray crystallography, which will inform future drug design parameters.
In Sub-Aim 2D, we will test hit compounds for target engagement in HGSC cells."
10853132,"Abstract
 Bladder cancer is the sixth most prevalent cancer malignancy. More than 80,000 new cases are diagnosed
in the USA each year, among which 75% are non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). High-risk NMIBC is
often treated with intravesical instillation of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a bacterial vaccine, following
surgically removing major tumors. While generally considered well tolerated, local and systemic side effects are
common with BCG and can lead to discontinuation of the therapy in up to 20% patients. Moreover, about 30%
patients do not respond to BCG. These patients require radical cystectomy with urinary diversion or
chemotherapy and radiation, both of which are associated with considerable morbidity. Furthermore, BCG is
currently in great shortage due to limited production and an increasing global demand. There is an urgent need
of new treatment options that afford high efficacy, can be manufactured easily, and are better tolerated by
patients.
 Our objective is to develop a safe and effective intravesical therapy based on phospholipid coated sodium
chloride nanoparticles (SCNPs). These nanoparticles can enter cells through endocytosis and degrade inside
them to release large amounts of Na+ and Cl-. This entails an increase of intracellular osmolarity, which causes
plasma membrane and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, leading to cell necrosis and apoptosis. It is
hypothesized that SCNPs as an intravesical therapy can be applied to affected bladder to kill bladder cancer
cells. After therapy, SCNPs are reduced to NaCl salt, which is safely excreted via urine or absorbed by the host.
Meanwhile, because SCNPs induce immunogenic cell death, it is also expected that intravesical SCNPs can
stimulate an anticancer immunity that helps prevent tumor recurrence and progression. In this project, we will
test these hypotheses first in vitro and then in vivo with murine orthotopic tumor models. Affording unique cancer
cell killing mechanisms and minimal side effects, SCNPs hold great potential in clinical translation as a novel
treatment option for bladder cancer."

Spine pain consistently ranks first or near the top in global rankings of disease burden, and epidemiological
data suggest the burden is worsening. The number of low back surgeries has increased by 300% over the past
2 decades, accounting for approximately 30% of spine-related costs in the US. While it can provide cost-
effective pain relief to some patients, up to 25% of those who undergo spine surgery will develop persistent
pain requiring additional surgery, imaging, or other invasive interventions. Moreover, many patients will
experience persistent opioid use, which carries significant risks of misuse, addiction, and overdose. Clinical
practice guidelines strongly recommend the use of multimodal – or ‘mind and body’ – treatments for effective
pain management after surgery. This approach combines interventions with analgesic or physical therapeutic
inputs alongside interventions with psychological or behavioral inputs to better address the multifaceted risk
factors for persistent pain and opioid use following surgery. Integration of Mindfulness delivered via mobile app
(mHealth) with auricular Acupuncture (AA) in individuals undergoing Spine Surgery (I-MASS) is a highly
promising multimodal treatment approach given the distinct yet complementary mechanisms by which
mindfulness and AA influence pain after surgery. Establishing the effectiveness of I-MASS requires a
rigorously designed pragmatic trial comparing it to usual medical care in adults who undergo spine surgery.
However, trials of this size and scope require careful preparation. This proposed mixed methods R34 project is
designed to answer important preparatory questions regarding the feasibility and acceptability of I-MASS
through the following Specific Aims: 1) Conduct interviews with patient and care delivery stakeholders to refine
and finalize the I-MASS intervention protocol by integrating mHealth mindfulness training and AA for use in
patients age 18-80 undergoing spine surgery; 2) Conduct a single-site, exploratory randomized controlled
clinical trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of I-MASS in patients undergoing single-level
laminectomy, discectomy or fusion; and 3) Use feasibility trial results to develop and submit a competitive
research proposal to NIH for a multi-site, pragmatic, randomized comparative effectiveness clinical trial
designed to rigorously evaluate I-MASS compared to mHealth mindfulness, AA, and usual care augmented
with standard education. The results of this R34 project will provide the information needed to successfully
execute on such a study and create new knowledge regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a highly
innovative non-pharmacological multimodal approach designed to improve the lives of patients undergoing
spine surgery."

10863859,"Overweight and obesity are linked to a number of chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM). Weight loss has been shown to help with the prevention of T2DM. Behavioral weight loss programs
that provide, encourage, or facilitate social support are associated with greater adherence to treatment. Social
support can also help to encourage consistent dietary self-monitoring, which is considered the cornerstone of
weight loss treatment and an important component of interventions targeting T2DM prevention and
management. Few studies have focused specifically on ways to target areas of social support that have proven
to be effective in face-to-face delivery settings.
 The Social Pounds Off Digitally (Social POD) study was a three-month randomized weight loss
intervention with content delivered remotely via twice-weekly podcasts (same for both intervention arms).
Overweight adults (N=51) were recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n= 26;
Social POD app that received points for self-monitoring and social support)) or the comparison group (n=25;
standard diet tracking app with no points). Social POD group participants lost significantly more weight (-5.3
kg; 95%CI: -7.5, -3.0) than those in the standard app group (-2.2 kg; 95%CI: -3.6, -1.0; p=0.02) and total points
earned significantly predicted % weight loss (B=-0.02, p=0.01). This study, with 39% of the participants being
African American, represents one of the more diverse study samples for a digital weight loss intervention. The
goal of the present proposal is to examine the Social POD intervention in a longer-term study (12 months) to
ensure that use of social gaming leads to sustainable behavior changes and continued weight loss.
 Our study has the following aims: Aim 1) Determine if the Social POD app plus points intervention
(SocialPOD+points; points for provision and receipt of social support) produces significantly more weight loss
at 12 months than the Social POD without points (SocialPOD-) among 240 adults with overweight or obesity
and ≥3 T2DM risk factors. Hypothesis: The SocialPOD+points group will lose more weight than the
SocialPOD- group. Aim 2) Examine the differences in social support provision and receipt between groups at
12 months. Hypothesis: That the SocialPOD+points group will have greater levels of social support provision
and receipt than the SocialPOD-. Secondary Aims) Examine usage patterns over time [e.g., do points sustain
engagement and promote weight loss maintenance?], potential mediators and moderators [engagement (e.g.,
frequency of self-monitoring)], demographic factors (e.g., sex, race, age)], the usability and acceptability of the
interventions, and the association of social support provision/receipt and psychosocial factors (e.g., motivation,
enjoyment) with weight loss. This approach has considerable public health appeal since, if the social gaming
approach proves to be successful in promoting and maintaining weight loss, it could be greatly scaled up for
widespread dissemination."

10876444,"Abstract
The goal of proposed experiments in this application is to determine how HIV infection disrupts intestinal
barrier function. It is now appreciated that microbial translocation across an impaired epithelial barrier leads to
circulating LPS, persistent immune activation and chronic inflammation in people living with HIV (PLWH).
These HIV associated effects are important contributors to premature development of neurocognitive
disorders, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome and bone abnormalities even in PLWH on optimal
combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Untreated infection is characterized by the production of
proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα). Following
therapy, cytokine levels decline but chronic inflammation continues. Prevention of inflammation-induced
comorbidities requires the development of more specific therapeutics targeting the underlying cause. However,
a gap exists in our understanding of the underlying molecular pathways involved. This proposal will capitalize
on an established collaboration between investigators with expertise in HIV biology and intestinal barrier
function/pathobiology. We have generated strong preliminary data that provides a framework for understanding
the underlying link between disrupted intestinal epithelial barrier function and HIV infection. While the overall
chronic inflammatory manifestations of HIV infection are likely to be multi-factorial, our exciting results support
an overarching hypothesis that lamina propria HIV-1 infected primary human CD4+T lymphocytes that closely
interact with intestinal epithelial initiate a process leading to enhanced production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines that negatively impact epithelial homeostasis resulting in a leaky intestinal barrier. Given these
important new insights, funding is requested to support a major collaborative effort between established
investigators in the areas of HIV biology and intestinal inflammation/barrier disruption to determine the
mechanism(s) through which primary human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and HIV-infected primary T cells
synergize to cause intestinal pathobiology. Specifically, we will determine the HIV-dependent mechanisms that
alter T-cell function and disrupt the intestinal barrier. In addition, we will identify the pathways altered in IECs
exposed to HIV infected T-cells that lead to barrier dysfunction. Findings generated from these studies will
allow a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying HIV related enteropathy that is known to be a
major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals and will lead to development of new
strategies to improve the health of HIV infected people.

 The mammalian secretory pathway regulates a cell’s extracellular interactions by making most signals
and receptors that moderate communication. Furthermore, it makes cell adhesion molecules and the
extracellular matrix components. Indeed it makes most proteins needed for a cell to interact with its
extracellular environment, which includes ~⅓ of their protein-coding genes in the human genome. The pathway
has hundreds of machinery proteins used for synthesizing and trafficking secreted proteins, but each of these
have their unique role in the process. However, for the ~8000 protein products of the secretory pathway, it
remains unclear what machinery is needed for each one. To further complicate this, each tissue expresses its
own subset of genes for the secretory pathway. Understanding the organization of the pathway and the
interactions between the secretory pathway machinery and secreted protein products is of considerable
importance since many diseases involve changes in the abundance of secreted and/or membrane proteins,
and these are not always accompanied by changes in mRNA. That is, the secretory pathway itself is regulating
changes in hormone secretion, managing ER stress, or amyloid formation. Thus, there is a fundamental need
to understand (1) what the secretory pathway machinery does, (2) which secreted and membrane proteins rely
upon it, (3) how the hundreds of machinery proteins work together, and (4) what regulates their functions. All of
these items require systems-level experiments, tools, and analyses to fully understand. Here we are
developing such resources for the community to answer fundamental questions. In this work, we are mapping
out all of the secretory pathway machinery and detailing their functions. We describe their functions
mathematically, and build computational models to account for their concerted functions, even for individual
tissues and cell types. Furthermore we are developing software and algorithms to help analyze the models and
use them to diagnose the molecular bases underlying secretory disorders. We are further developing and
deploying experimental techniques to more fully identify all of the secretory machinery proteins needed to
facilitate the production of each specific secreted or membrane protein, and will use those techniques to
identify these interactions for liver-secreted proteins. Finally, we are using genomics and systems biology
techniques to unravel the regulatory mechanisms controlling the tissue-specific expression of the secretory
pathway. Through this, valuable resources will be developed and shared with the community to make it easier
to study the secretory pathway as a biomolecular system."

Gastrointestinal malfunctions and immune activation remain significant health issues for people living with
HIV/AIDS in the era of anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Immune activation fuels HIV reservoirs that are established
early during infection and support virus rebound after ART interruption (ATI). Increasing evidence points toward
sex differences in HIV pathogenesis, disease progression, and persistence. Identifying sex-specific immune
parameters associated with viral persistence and rebound will be critical to our long term goal of developing
personalized therapeutic strategies to reliably halt HIV-associated chronic diseases, and to target HIV reservoirs.
In subjects without ART, women have higher levels of immune activation than men and have a higher risk of
developing AIDS. Sex differences in immune activation in HIV-infected subjects on ART are less definitive,
possibly due to confounding factors, including gender (involving social/behavior factors) differences in seeking
treatment. Recent evidence identifying estrogen receptor 1 as a key regulator of HIV latency in CD4+ T cells
suggests the involvement of estrogen signaling in sex-based differences in HIV persistence. However, the role
of estrogen in HIV persistence in vivo remains unknown, as estrogen induces type I IFNs and other pro-
inflammatory cytokines, resulting in immune activation. Research in this area has been lacking a reliable animal
model. In that regard, we have developed a rhesus macaque (RM) model that mimics key features of human
HIV infection providing promising avenues for pursuing sex-based difference studies. The model, which employs
R5 SHIV C109 intrarectal challenge, displays a spectrum of disease outcomes similar to human AIDS. In this
model, fast disease progression occurs in females only, and is accompanied by an uncontrolled robust mucosal
immune response. All male RMs tested to date exhibit normal (slow/chronic) progression. We hypothesize that
kinetics and magnitude of immune dysregulation that drive viral replication, persistence, and rebound exhibit
sex-based differences and that estrogen may partially contribute to sex difference in immune responses and
viral persistence. We will determine sex-specific immune cellular and molecular determinants relevant to HIV
reservoirs and rebound longitudinally. The contribution of estrogen to sex differences in immune regulation and
viral persistence will also be examined. The proposed work is significant because it promises to provide new
insights into the cross-talk between intestinal immune activation and viral persistence that are differentially
regulated in male and female RMs, which will be critical for developing personalized therapeutic strategies to
reliably halt HIV-associated chronic disease, and to target HIV reservoirs."
10893462,"Mitochondrial “connectivity” and mitochondrial-endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) “proximity” each
potentiate mitochondrial-mediated metabolism and necrosis through a variety of mechanisms. Mitofusins (MFN)
1 and 2 are large GTPases that play critical roles in mitochondrial connectivity and mitochondrial-ER/SR
proximity. MFN1 and MFN2 reside in the outer mitochondrial membrane where they mediate mitochondrial
fusion. MFN2, but not MFN1, also resides in the ER/SR membrane, where it tethers ER/SR to mitochondria
through interactions with mitochondrial-localized MFN1 or MFN2. Deletion of MFN1 or MFN2 reduces myocardial
infarct (MI) size during ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Conversely, MFN1 and MFN2 overexpression augment
metabolism. Given this information, therapeutic inhibition of MFNs would be expected to reduce infarct size
during MI, while therapeutic activation of MFNs might attenuate heart failure (HF) by augmenting metabolism.
The challenge has been to find a means to manipulate the activities of endogenous MFNs. In collaboration with
others, we created the first peptides and small molecules that modulate conformations of MFN1 and MFN2 and
delineated the underlying structural basis for these effects. We reported previously that MFN activators increase,
while MFN inhibitors decrease, mitochondrial fusion. These are direct effects that require binding of these agents
to either MFN1 or MFN2. We present here new data showing that MFN activators increase, while MFN inhibitors
decrease, mitochondrial-ER/SR proximity and Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria. Moreover, we observed that MFN
activators exacerbate infarct size during myocardial I/R, while MFN inhibitors reduce infarct size in both heart
and brain I/R models. Interestingly, these effects of the activators are dependent on MFN2, but not MFN1,
suggesting the importance of mitochondrial-ER/SR proximity but not excluding the possibility that MFN2-
dependent changes in mitochondrial connectivity and shape also contribute. Additionally, MFN activators
promote cardiomyocyte metabolism. The goals of this project are to understand the mechanisms by which MFN
modulators impact cardiomyocyte death and metabolism and to test whether these agents might provide novel
therapeutic strategies for MI and HF. We propose: 1. To correlate changes in MFN activation/inhibition with
mitochondrial connectivity, mitochondrial-ER/SR proximity, Ca2+ transfer, cell death, and metabolism in adult
cardiomyocytes. 2. To delineate the individual contributions of mitochondrial connectivity and mitochondrial-
ER/SR proximity to cell death and metabolism in cardiomyocytes in vivo. 3. To assess whether mitofusin
modulators provide novel therapeutic strategies for MI and HF. This project breaks new ground in defining the
mechanisms by which MFN modulators impact cardiomyocyte death and metabolism and whether MFNs provide
an actionable target for novel therapies directed against MI and HF."

Cellular heterogeneity within the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pool is an increasingly
recognized aspect of normal hematopoiesis. Variability among individual cell clones contributes to these
heterogenous cellular states driving diversity of functional outcomes. Each clone bears differences across these
functional attributes, which is scripted by the epigenome of each cell. Here, we propose that distinctive clone-
specific features are particularly relevant to genetic clonal mutations. Specifically, the cellular and epigenetic
state of the clone in which a mutation occurs (the clone-of-origin) will alter cellular outcomes. Further, we
hypothesize that clonal diversity may contribute to the highly variable penetrance of a disease phenotype in the
context of clonal hematopoiesis (CH). We have assembled four teams of hematopoiesis experts and a pioneering
investigator in defining gene regulatory networks utilizing single-cell genomics to address this hypothesis. Using
a variety of models, we have evaluated the most common mutations in CH affecting Tet2, Dnmt3a2 and Asxl1.
Our motivating hypothesis and these preliminary studies support three focused areas of investigation: 1.
Epigenetic states poise the clone-of-origin for transformation by CH mutations, sensitizing cells for clonal
dominance; 2. Clones bearing a genetic mutation will exhibit divergent responses to exogenous stimuli further
enabling clonal dominance; 3. Metabolic adaptation frequently occur in dominant clones rendering them
vulnerable to metabolic drugs to reduce clonal burden. Collectively, these studies will provide a detailed
assessment of how hematopoietic clones become dominant, whether molecular signatures can be used to
predict clonal behavior in the setting of CH and whether low intensity, metabolism focused strategies can be
developed to impair competitively advantaged clones."

10874414,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal will examine maladaptive gray matter (GM) myelination as a candidate mechanism underpinning
two functional brain abnormalities well established in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): hyper-
connectedness of the threat response network (TRN: defined as hippocampus (HIP), amygdala (AMYG),
anterior insula (INS), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)), and disruption of the default mode network
(DMN). Experience- and activity-dependent GM myelination have been observed in many brain regions and
have broad relevance to psychiatric disorders. While experience-dependent myelination evolved to accelerate
nerve conduction, myelination in GM has been shown to reduce synaptic density and synapse-based
neuroplasticity in animal models. Our model proposes that excess GM myelination in the TRN in PTSD results
in a hyperconnected salience network (SN; which includes AMYG, dACC, and INS but not HIP. See “Bridging
Frameworks” section) and a poorly connected and hypoactive DMN. Given that myelin development and re-
myelination in both cortical and subcortical GM are responsive to therapeutic agents, confirming our model
could lead to novel targets for treatment of PTSD, a condition that has resisted pharmacotherapeutic
intervention. Our proposed model yields a candidate mechanism underpinning the “synaptic disconnection”
syndrome proposed by Krystal and colleagues to explain impaired functional brain connectivity in PTSD. It is
also noteworthy that recent evidence suggests that DMN dysconnectivity in PTSD is not associated with the
disruption of large frontal white matter tracks. As such, excess GM myelination in key structures may supply an
explanation for this phenomenon. Using a combination of postmortem neuropathology in PTSD cases versus
brain bank controls, and in vivo neuroimaging at 3T in a matched case control design, we will examine if PTSD
is associated with increased myelin content and decreased synaptic and neurite density in the TRN structures.
Finally, we will test if increased GM myelin and decreased neurite density in TRN account for increased resting
state (RS) connectivity within the SN and decreased RS connectivity within the DMN in the same living
subjects. Integration of postmortem neuropathology, afforded by the National PTSD Brain Bank, and in vivo
neuroimaging will enable a highly novel but broadly testable exploration of GM myelination and its
consequences in the human brain as modified by PTSD."

As of May 2022, there have been over 1 million COVID-19 cases and over 150,000 COVID-19 deaths among
U.S. nursing home residents. One of the most widespread mitigation measures implemented by nursing homes
was a visitation ban. In March and April 2020, 31 states issued state-wide visitation bans, affecting at least 66%
of facilities and 70% of residents in the U.S. Visitation bans may prevent transmission between facilities and the
community. Yet, any ban is incomplete because of staff who travel between the facility and the community. To
our knowledge, there is no empirical study examining the effectiveness of visitation bans on preventing COVID-
19 infection rates, hospitalizations, and deaths. What also matters are the adverse effects of visitation bans on
residents. Visitation bans can substantially reduce informal care, increase social isolation, and disrupt routine
care, resulting in adverse events such as decreased function and increases in depression, falls, and
hospitalization. Residents with Alzheimer's Disease & Related Dementias (ADRD), who rely more on caregivers,
may have a greater risk of adverse events than those without ADRD. Our team has collected visitation data at
both the state and facility levels, which document the dates when states initiated and lifted bans, as well as
weekly bans data at the facility level in Ohio. We also collect open-ended comments from family members from
a state-wide family satisfaction survey in Ohio. By linking data on visitation bans with national Medicare claims
and assessment data, we propose a convergent parallel mixed methods study to examine the
effectiveness and adverse consequences of visitation bans in nursing homes. We will study the 9,876
nursing homes in the 31 states that banned indoor visitation in March 2020, then lifted those bans between June
and November 2020. We will also study the 701 nursing homes in Ohio, where we have weekly data on the
presence of bans for each facility. Matched case-control design on prior infection rates and Hierarchical
Generalized Linear Mixed Models will examine the association of lifting visitation bans with COVID-19 and health
outcomes. Focus group interviews with direct care staff and analyses of family comments will be conducted to
examine the effects of visitation bans on daily care practices and resident health outcomes. Understanding both
the benefits and harms of visitation bans can inform future pandemic responses in nursing homes.
The specific aims of this project are: 1) To assess the effectiveness of visitation bans on preventing COVID-19
infection (primary), hospitalization, and deaths among nursing home residents; 2) To evaluate the association of
visitation bans with changes in function (primary), mood/behaviors, and adverse events among long-stay
residents with or without ADRD; and 3) To understand how visitation bans affected daily care practices within
nursing homes and resident health outcomes."
10806193,"Project Summary
The largest class of genetic alterations that cause disease are single point mutations. Most of
these disease-causing errors can be remedied if a specific adenosine is changed to guanosine
on the RNA transcript. This proposal aims to repurpose an RNA editing enzyme and direct it to
selectively edit targeted adenosines in mRNA to treat genetic disorders. The RNA editing enzyme
Adenosine Deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) can convert adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) by
catalyzing a deamination reaction on the nucleobase. Inosine is read as guanosine by the cellular
translation machinery providing the ability to alter codons in mRNA. This proposal will focus on
selectively editing disease-causing nonsense mutations, by directing ADAR to edit the adenosine
in the stop codon thus allowing the transcript to continue translation, producing functional full-
length protein. Because ADARs selectively edit adenosines in regions of dsRNA, disease-causing
nonsense mutations can be selectively targeted by furnishing an appropriate guide
oligonucleotide to create a dsRNA substrate. Canonical Watson-Crick complementarity of duplex
RNA does not produce efficient substrates for ADARs, making it challenging to design effective
guide oligonucleotides to target specific nonsense mutations. A high-throughput assay is
proposed to search all sequence space of guide RNA oligonucleotides to identify lead sequences
displaying high editing efficiency of the targeted nonsense transcript using endogenous ADARs.
These lead sequences can be further optimized by structure-guided rational design methods. The
lab has significant experience in determining ADAR-RNA structures to atomic resolution and
leveraging this knowledge to improve editing efficiency. Both X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM
techniques are proposed for ADAR1 or ADAR2 complexed with dsRNA of the lead sequence
bound to its targeted mRNA segment. These structures will provide the basis for rational design
adjustments to develop nucleotide analogs to incorporate into guide oligonucleotides that can
fashion structural features for improved editing and increased metabolic stability. This method of
site-directed RNA editing (SDRE) to treat genetic disorders offers many advantages over current
editing tools, which often require addition of sizable proteins (e.g., CRISPR/Cas). When fully
developed, this method would permit the simple administration shorter oligonucleotides allowing
the cell’s endogenous ADARs to recode the nonsense mutation to treat many genetic disorders."
10841710,"In the mammalian sensory cortex, hierarchically-organized areas are reciprocally connected via feedforward (FF)
and feedback (FB) circuits. FF connections generate the more complex response properties of neurons in higher
areas within parallel streams specialized in processing specific stimulus attributes. In contrast, the function of
FB connections remains unknown. In the visual cortex, FB has been implicated in top-down phenomena, such
as visual attention, prediction, and visual context. However, these roles have remained hypothetical, due to the
lack of tools to selectively label, record, and manipulate the activity of FB neurons. As FB circuits are ubiquitous
in cortex, and abnormalities in FB connectivity and function in humans have been linked to neurological
disorders, such as attention deficits and autism, it is important to understand normal FB connectivity and
function in primates. During prior funding, we developed novel viral and optogenetic tools to selectively label FB
neurons, trace their inputs and outputs, and record and manipulate their activity in primate cortex. Using these
tools, we found that, anatomically, FB connections between visual areas V2 and V1 form parallel pathways, make
direct contacts with V1 neurons sending FF projections to V2, and link V2 and V1 neurons preferring similar
visual stimulus features. Functionally, we found V2 FB conveys global visuo-spatial information to V1, and
controls the receptive field size, surround suppression and response amplitude of V1 cells. In these studies,
however, we did not disentangle FB connections related to different layers. Anatomical, functional and
theoretical evidence indicates that within each parallel FB pathway there are at least two, and probably more,
sets of FB arising from, and terminating in, different layers, likely having distinct organizations and functions.
Our goal is to understand the connectivity and computational function of FB connections related to different
layers of origin and termination within each FB stream. Using selective labeling of FB neurons, we will
determine the differential contribution of FB from different V2 layers to their V1 termination layers. Moreover,
using rabies-virus-mediated monosynaptic input tracing (TRIO) combined with optical imaging of V1 and V2
functional maps, we will determine the functional connectivity of, and the V1 cell types targeted by, different
laminar-specific FB sets (Aims1,2). Finally, we will optogenetically manipulate the activity of distinct V2 FB sets
to determine their differential impact on V1 neurons' spontaneous and visually-evoked responses (Aim3).
Impact. This proposal will reveal the anatomy and function of laminar-specific FB circuits between V2 and V1.
This information will inform and refine models of FB function, influence the design of artificial systems striving
to achieve vision, and provide new insights into the circuit-level bases for neurological disorders that have been
linked to abnormal FB connectivity and function (attention disorders, autism)."

Respiratory motor control deficit is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with spinal cord
injury. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a rehabilitation strategy for respiration in patients with
spinal cord injury as a standard of care. Our previous findings demonstrate that respiratory function in patients
with chronic spinal cord injury can be improved by using our original inspiratory-expiratory pressure threshold
respiratory training protocol. However, the effectiveness of this intervention is limited to the amount of
functional capacity preserved below the neurological level of injury. Our preliminary data obtained for this
proposal demonstrate that electrical spinal cord stimulation applied non-invasively to target spinal respiratory
circuits in combination with respiratory training can activate and re-organize spinal motor networks for
respiration. We propose to investigate respiratory motor control-related responses to transcutaneous spinal
cord stimulation alone and in combination with respiratory training. By characterization of respiratory muscle
activation patterns using surface electromyography in association with pulmonary functional and related
cardiovascular measures, we expect to determine specific stimulation parameters needed to increase spinal
excitability below level of injury to enhance responses to the input from supraspinal centers that remain after
injury and to promote the neural plasticity driven by the respiratory training. This hypothesis will be tested by

Microbial metabolic function and adaptability are important in many facets of human health and
disease. This proposal centers on studies of the microbial metabolic enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
5-phosphate synthase (DXPS). DXPS catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent
synthesis of the essential metabolite DXP, which is found in the gut microbiota, pathogenic
bacteria and parasites, but not in humans. Positioned at a metabolic branchpoint, DXP serves as
a precursor to indispensable isoprenoids and vitamins, thus, we postulate DXPS plays key roles
in microbiome function and microbial metabolic adaptation. Our long-term goal is to learn how
microbes use DXPS in different contexts, toward understanding its roles in the microbiome and
its potential as an antimicrobial target. Our group discovered a unique ligand-gated mechanism
used by DXPS that bestows targets for selective inhibition and may enable DXPS to sense and
respond to its environment. The goals of this proposal are to dissect how DXPS responds to
molecular cues, examine this sensing mechanism in different chemical contexts, and establish
novel inhibition strategies that target this distinctive feature of DXPS. Insights gained from this
research will direct our thinking about DXPS function, and guide development of chemical probes

CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins
are a group of diverse crRNA guided nucleases providing prokaryotes adaptive immunity to foreign genetic
elements. Cas10-Csm is an approximately 300 kDa multiprotein complex that upon detecting foreign RNA
transcripts initiates a DNA and RNA degradation response. Distinct CRISPR-Cas types use the information in
crRNA to detect either double-stranded DNA or single-stranded RNA. While much is known concerning the
specificity mechanisms of dsDNA detection by Type I (Cascade) and Type II (Cas9) systems, little is known
concerning the specificity mechanisms of ssRNA detection by Type III (Cas10) systems. This is significant
because evidence exists that the mechanisms for enforcing specificity during dsDNA detection and ssRNA
detection are fundamentally different: competition between rehybridization of the non-base paired DNA strand
to re-form dsDNA or binding to a Cas protein is essential to the dsDNA detecting specificity mechanism. This
mechanism is not possible during specific detection of ssRNA. The hypothesis will be tested that in the Cas10-
Csm system mismatches in specific, sensitive locations within the crRNA-target RNA duplex disrupt
interference. Cas10-Csm structural models suggest the Csm2 component of Cas10-Csm directly contacts
bound target RNA. We will test the hypothesis that Csm2 plays an integral role in detecting cognate RNA
binding to Cas10-Csm and relays this signal to Cas10 via structural changes. We will use cryo-EM to
determine the `structural mechanism' for Cas10 activation. The research proposed will impact several
emerging biotechnologies such as the deployment of Cas10 as a point-of-care RNA virus diagnostic."

The fundamental unit of hierarchically organized eukaryotic chromatin is the nucleosome, which contains 147
base pairs of genomic DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histone proteins. Conventionally, nucleosomes
have been viewed as DNA packaging units that inhibit gene expression by obstructing the accessibility of DNA
to the transcriptional machinery. However, we and others have shown that nucleosomes also serve as potent
hotspots which recruit, modulate, and stimulate the activity of various essential chromatin regulators, indicating
a new role for nucleosomes in furnishing the genome with a multitude of physical features and interactions which
direct protein function. As such, I hypothesize that the physical characteristics and topology of nucleosomes
modulate the activity of chromatin regulators, constituting an underappreciated layer of physical parameters
encoded within chromatin architecture that govern genomic transactions in the nucleus. These parameters
include the shape and composition of the nucleosome core particle as well as the spacing and geometry of
contiguous nucleosomes in an array. To test this hypothesis, I propose to use single-molecule fluorescence
detection and force manipulation technologies established in my laboratory, which uniquely track real-time
transient and heterogeneous molecular interactions, to investigate the physical characteristics of nucleosome
topology that determine its capacity to tune the activity of several important classes of chromatin regulators at
multiple scales. We will first investigate how the topology of individual nucleosomes directs the DNA targeting
activity and cooperation of essential pioneer transcription factors (Aim 1). We will then probe how the geometry
of local nucleosomes in an array modulates the engagement, recruitment, and propagation of chromatin-
modifying enzymes on chromatin (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the biophysical basis of global nucleosome
localization and functionalization by energy-consuming molecular machines (Aim 3). Together, these studies will
zoom in on the topology of nucleosomes comprising a layer of biophysical parameters encoded within chromatin
architecture that regulate genomic transactions in the nucleus. They will contribute evidence towards a new
perspective that views nucleosomes as genomic regulators which harness their unique physical features to
actively modulate, recruit, and stimulate the activity of chromatin-associated factors, rather than passive DNA
packaging units. The proposed investigations will shed light on a nucleosome-focused angle for tackling several
long-standing questions about the interplay between chromatin and its regulators and promise to mechanistically
inform how disease-associated mutations perturb essential genomic activities, potentially revealing mutation-
selective protein-chromatin interfaces that may be therapeutically exploited to treat human disease."

Xenotransplantation has long been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to address the ongoing organ shortage
in transplantation. In recent years, pig-to-primate xenotransplantation outcomes have dramatically improved
following advances in the genetic engineering of pig donors and utilization of costimulation blockade-based
immunosuppression, such that translation to the clinic appears within reach. Highly allosensitized patients,
those who have developed anti-donor antibody as a response to foreign HLA exposure, are potential first
candidates for xenotransplantation given their reduced chances of undergoing allotransplantation. However,
the impact of allosensitization in the setting of xenotransplantation has not yet been fully elucidated in pig-to-
primate models. Our preliminary data suggest that allosensitization promotes antibody-mediated rejection
(AMR) following kidney xenotransplantation and leads to early graft failure. Use of donor kidneys from highly
engineered pigs prolong xenograft survival yet do not fully alleviate AMR development. Additional therapeutic
strategies are thus needed to dampen the post-transplant humoral response following xenotransplantation in
sensitized recipients. This project aims to evaluate novel desensitization and immunosuppression strategies to
control the post-transplant humoral response and foster long-term xenograft survival in sensitized recipients.
Our overarching hypothesis is that both conditioning the host immune response ahead of xenotransplantation
through desensitization and continuous targeting of B cells, plasma cells, or complements following
transplantation, are necessary to control the post-transplant humoral response and alter the repopulating
xenoreactive immune repertoire to favor long-term graft acceptance. To explore this, we propose 3 specific
aims: Specific aim 1: We will define the effects of desensitization (costimulation blockade and proteasome
inhibitor) pre-transplant in rhesus monkeys undergoing kidney xenotransplantation. Specific aim 2: We will
define the impact of adjuvant therapies targeting downstream elements of the humoral response following
xenotransplantation. Specific aim 3: We will identify the functional phenotype of xeno-specific T and B cell
repertoires required to establish long-term AMR-free xenograft survival while preserving anti-viral/vaccinal
response. These advances will ultimately position us to conduct a first-in-human xenokidney transplantation in
sensitized patients testing this optimized immunosuppressive regimen. Our proposal involves many academic
and industry collaborations that are ongoing as attested by letters of support. The impact of this proposal has
broad implications that may benefit U.S. citizens affected by end stage renal failure or by immune-mediated
illnesses or infections."

BET proteins are directly involved in pathologies such as viral infection and different types of
cancer. Although the different BET proteins satisfy different roles in the cell and are preferentially
expressed in different tissues, current BET inhibition strategies are non-specific – resulting in
toxicity. The ET domain of BET proteins has recently emerged as a protein interaction hub with
promising selectivity of binders towards specific BET proteins – making the ET domain an
interesting target towards the design of novel drug therapeutics. Yet, little is known about the ET
interactome or its binding mechanism. This proposal aims to increase our understanding of the
ET interactome (Aim 1) by using computational tools to: a) identify possible binders; b) select the
strongest binders using machine learning and physics-based approaches; and c) characterize the
most promising leads through NMR experiments. The challenge lies in addressing the
polymorphic nature of ET: it can undergo conformational changes to bind different peptide
sequences – which in turn bind along different binding modes. Such binding plasticity
concomitantly leads to a wide range of binding affinities. Furthermore, a particular peptide
sequence binds the ET domain of different BET proteins with different binding affinities, setting
the foundation for the design of inhibitors specific to each BET protein. However, it is not clear
where the origin of specificity lies, as the ET domains have high sequence and structural similarity
across BET members. Thus, Aim 2 will unveil the binding mechanism for peptides to ET and
elucidate the origin of specificity through the use of adaptive sampling molecular dynamics
strategies and Markov State Models. The relationship between binding affinity and binding mode
is currently unknown. It could be that virus are exploiting a binding mode that leads to higher
binding affinity than those used by regulatory host proteins. Aim 3 of the proposal addresses this
issue by designing novel peptide binders to identify the limits of binding affinity amongst the
different binding modes. These computational designs will lead to the identification of hot-spot
regions in the binding domain to exploit towards the long-term goal of therapeutic design
strategies."

 Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) results from a combination of insulin resistance, most often brought about by
obesity, and a gradual and unrelenting erosion of the ability of pancreatic beta cells to secrete sufficient insulin
to meet the increased metabolic demand for insulin. A major mediator of beta cell dysfunction is glucose
toxicity, mediated by sustained hyperglycemia. During the pathogenesis of T2D a vicious cycle ensues, where
insulin resistance increases the demand for more insulin, but beta cells become “exhausted” and unable to
secret enough insulin to maintain glucose homeostasis, leading to increased hyperglycemia, more beta cell
exhaustion and death, erosion of beta cell mass, and eventually the need for insulin therapy. Therefore, there
is an urgent need for new therapies that block the vicious cycle and preserve beta cell mass. We believe we
have uncovered a molecular mechanism that explains the vicious cycle that erodes beta cell function and beta
cell mass during T2D. This proposal will explore the molecular details of this mechanism and test the feasibility
of therapeutic interventions that preserve rodent and human beta cells in models of glucose toxicity and T2D.
The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the feed-forward mechanism of ChREBPβ expression
becomes dysregulated in T2D and drives glucose toxicity through expression of the pro-oxidative activity of
Txnip, the effects of which can be mitigated by the activation of Nrf2. Furthermore, maneuvers that break the
vicious cycle of ChREBPβ production, or mitigate its actions through Txnip inhibition, or Nrf2 activation,
protects beta cell mass and alleviates diabetic burden. This proposal will test this hypothesis by exploring the
molecular regulatory mechanisms between these 3 factors, and by depleting either ChREBPβ or Txnip, or
elevating NRF2, in mouse models of diabetes or glucotoxicity, or in glucotoxic or T2D human islets. Specific
Aim 1 will explore the regulatory relationships between ChREBPβ, Txnip, and NRF2 that determine beta cell
fate. Specific Aim 2 will examine how depletion of ChREBPβ, or Txnip, or activation of NRF2 affects beta cell
function and glucose homeostasis in diabetic and glucotoxic mouse models. Specific Aim 3 will test if depletion
of ChREBPβ, or TXNIP, or activation of NRF2 affects beta cell function and survival in glucotoxic or T2D
human islets. Our results will inform the design of therapies that will mitigate beta cell glucose toxicity and may
result in very specific drugs that target beta cells to preserve beta cell mass and function and alleviate diabetic
symptoms and complications."

This proposal responds to the youth suicide crisis by optimizing a suicide prevention intervention delivery
strategy that is feasible, acceptable, and scalable in pediatric primary care (PPC). Although PPC providers
routinely identify at-risk youth, no suicide prevention intervention is suited for the immediate, in-office delivery
that this clinical situation demands. In our prior work, we developed and tested the effectiveness of an integrated
adolescent suicide prevention intervention, iCHART (integrated Care to Help At-Risk Teens), in a controlled,
academic PPC setting that relied on behavioral health (BH) providers. iCHART consists of: 1) Screening Wizard,
a web-based enhanced screener to aid PPC providers in treatment decisions; 2) BRITE, an app-supported
intervention that guides youth in developing a personalized, smartphone-based safety plan; and 3)
Text2Connect, an automated texting intervention that motivates youth to follow providers’ recommendations.
The original version of iCHART components showed feasibility, usability, and acceptability across youth, parents,
and providers and preliminary effectiveness in enhancing BH referral, referral follow-through, and decreasing
depression. However, a critical gap remains in equipping front line pediatricians, who generally lack access to
onsite BH providers, with suicide prevention intervention strategies that are feasible, usable, and acceptable for
their workflows and in their setting. This proposal aims to address this gap through the development of a
computerized version of As Safe As Possible (cASAP) to deliver aspects of the iCHART intervention that required
BH support (i.e., psychoeducation about safety planning, cognitive-behavioral skills to cope with distress, and
facilitate collaboration with parents). In the proposed study, we will partner with the American Academy of
Pediatrics (AAP) national PPC practice-based research network, Pediatric Research in Office Settings (PROS)
to develop and test a version of iCHART that can be provided in the PPC setting without onsite BH providers,
termed iCHART-cASAP. In this proposal, we will draw upon our extensive expertise in human-computer
interaction (HCI) methods and user studies with youth, parents, and PPC providers, to inform the technology
design of a computerized version of ASAP (cASAP) to provide youth and parents information about safety
planning, cognitive behavioral skills to cope with distress, and parent communication with youth about their
mental health. We will then conduct a stepped wedge pilot randomized trial with 60 youth aged 12-17 at risk for
suicide (past month suicide ideation/attempt) identified in PPC. We will compare iCHART-cASAP to usual care
and the impact on depression and suicide risk at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-up. Following the pilot trial, we will
conduct a mixed methods study with PPC providers to develop an accompanying implementation strategy. Our
findings will inform a future, fully powered R01 effectiveness-implementation trial in the PROS network and in
partnership with the AAP to test iCHART-cASAP’s impact on identification, treatment engagement, safety
planning, and ultimately, suicidal behavior."

Our randomized trial will assess the effectiveness and fidelity of a technology-based strategy to promote
preconception care and diabetes self-management among women with type 2 diabetes in primary care.
More than 30 million people in the U.S. have diabetes and 1 in 3 adults are projected to have the disease by
2050. While diabetes has historically affected older individuals, its incidence is increasing rapidly among younger
adults, including women of reproductive age (18-44 years). Women with early-onset type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are
at higher risk of cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality and adverse reproductive outcomes, including
congenital anomalies and perinatal mortality. Achieving glycemic control is essential to reducing these risks.
As half of all pregnancies are unintended, clinical guidelines recommend providers routinely engage all women
of reproductive age in preconception care. For women with T2DM, this includes: 1) achieving glycemic control
through diabetes self-care, 2) using effective contraception until glycemic control is achieved and pregnancy is
desired, 3) discontinuing use of teratogenic medications if pregnancy could occur, 4) taking folic acid daily to
reduce increased risk of neural tube defects and 5) managing cardiovascular and other T2DM-related risks.
Despite these recommendations, up to 80% of women with T2DM do not receive preconception counseling.
Provider time limitations are often cited as a barrier, as is a lack of available resources.
Our Promoting REproductive Planning And REadiness in Diabetes (PREPARED) strategy will utilize health
information and consumer technologies to `hardwire' preconception care and promote diabetes self-
management among reproductive-aged, adult women with T2DM in primary care. PREPARED will leverage
electronic health record technology at clinic visits to: [1] promote medication reconciliation and safety, [2] prompt
provider preconception counseling, and [3] deliver low literacy print tools to reinforce counseling and promote
diabetes self-care. Post-visit, text messaging will be used to: [4] encourage healthy lifestyle behaviors.
We will conduct a randomized trial at multiple primary care practices among English and Spanish-speaking
women, age 18-44, with T2DM (N=840; n=420 per arm). Our study aims are to: 1) test the effectiveness of
PREPARED, compared to usual care, to improve patient knowledge of reproductive risks, engagement in
diabetes self-care behaviors, and glycemic control; 2) assess whether PREPARED reduces disparities in these
outcomes versus usual care; and 3) evaluate the fidelity of PREPARED to prompt medication reconciliation and
preconception counseling and to deliver patient education and post-visit support of diabetes self-care."

Dr. Tessa Novick, an Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at the University of
Texas at Austin Dell Medical School, is a nephrologist, trained social worker and health services researcher
whose career goal is to become an independent investigator in patient-oriented research focused on improving
care for marginalized populations with kidney disease. This K23 award will provide Dr. Novick with training and
mentored research experience in the following areas: (1) using complementary advanced epidemiological and
qualitative methods to understand the scope and nature of a problem to inform interventions; (2) health
disparities and community based participatory research; (3) intervention and clinical trial development,
execution and interpretation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Novick has assembled a mentoring team comprised
of primary co-mentors: Dr. Deidra Crews, Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Nephrology at
Johns Hopkins University, who is an internationally recognized leader in kidney disease disparities and
interventions to address them; Dr. Elizabeth Jacobs, Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Texas
at Austin Dell Medical School, who is internationally regarded for her work investigating health-care disparities,
interventions to address social determinants of health, and advancing culturally competent care for diverse
populations. The focus of the proposed mentored research is on understanding how health-related social
needs of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) impact their care and how they might be addressed.
ESKD affects over 700,000 Americans, and requires substantial patient engagement in order to achieve
optimal outcomes. Health-related social needs are individual-level social determinants of health, such as
unstable housing, food insecurity, transportation and utility needs. Dr. Novick hypothesizes that health-related
social needs impair patient engagement, and are associated with higher acute care utilization and mortality. Dr.
Novick further hypothesizes that dialysis patients will identify acceptable interventions to address health-related
social needs, and interventions being tested in the general population using community health workers and
organizations that bridge patients to community resources are feasible in the dialysis population. Dr. Novick will
test these hypotheses using a series of complementary studies that (1) leverage data from the Veterans Health
Administration and United States Renal Data System; (2) gain an in-depth understanding of the problem using
qualitative research methods; and (3) refine an intervention that uses community health workers to connect
dialysis patients with community resources."

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the 8th most common form of adult cancer in the US. Despite recent improvement
in treatment options, the majority of patients with metastatic RCC continue to succumb to this disease, resulting
in over 100,000 deaths per year worldwide. Thus, it is important to identify novel therapeutic strategies to more
effectively treat this deadly disease. Our preliminary studies suggest that YAP/TAZ function as master regulators
of the core oncogenic transcriptional network across most subtypes of RCC and are required for maintaining the
transcriptional and metabolic homeostasis of RCC tumors. The first major aim of our proposal is to determine
the therapeutic efficacies and mechanisms of action of first-in-class YAP/TAZ inhibitors in patient-derived RCC
tumor models. Besides in vivo efficacy studies, we will employ cutting-edge epigenomic techniques including
Cut&Tag, omni-ATAC-seq and 3’-RNAseq to probe how genetic and pharmacological inhibition of YAP/TAZ
affect the compositions and activities of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional complexes and the global epigenetic and
transcriptional landscape in RCC tumors. Through these analyses, we will be able to gain critical insights into
the molecular functions of YAP/TAZ in RCC tumors, but also reconstruct the core ensemble of the RCC
oncogenic transcriptional network. The second major aim of this proposal is to develop mechanism-driven
combination strategies to more effectively treat RCC tumors. Through high-throughput drug screening and
extensive mechanistic studies, we recently identified MEK and BET inhibitors as two major classes of drugs that
strongly synergize with genetic or pharmacological inhibition of YAP/TAZ to suppress oncogenic transcription
and eliminate YAP/TAZ-addicted tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Based on these results, we will investigate
whether combining low doses of MEK or BET inhibitors with YAP/TAZ inhibitors could lead to durable tumor
regression without increasing systematic toxicities in RCC PDX models. Furthermore, we will conduct functional
genomic studies to elucidate how MEK and BET inhibitors amply the effects of YAP/TAZ inactivation, leading to
the collapse of the RCC oncogenic transcriptional network. Finally, we will investigate how YAP/TAZ inhibitors
affect the RCC tumor secretome and immune infiltrates and whether they could be used to overcome resistance
to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Together, these studies will greatly enhance our understanding of the crosstalk
and redundancies between the oncogenic pathways that govern the growth and survival of RCC cells, potentially
yielding more effective combination strategies to overcome treatment resistance in RCC patients."
10890042,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The goal of this project is to use quantitative PET-MR imaging of the lung to accurately quantify molecular
abnormalities associated with pulmonary fibrosis, to predict disease progression, and to provide an early
indication of whether anti-fibrotic therapy is likely to be effective. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a
progressive and ultimately fatal disease with a median survival of less than 4 years from the time of diagnosis.
The treatment options remain limited due to highly variable clinical course and poorly understood pathogenic
mechanisms. Current strategies to diagnose and monitor IPF include lung biopsy, pulmonary function tests that
measure global lung function, and anatomic imaging tools such as high-resolution computed tomography
(HRCT). Yet these methods are limited in their ability to detect disease early, determine disease activity at any
one measure, or monitor the therapeutic response. Molecular imaging may be an alternative approach that is
more sensitive to detect early fibrosis and potentially capable of distinguishing new, active fibrosis from stable
disease – urgent and unmet clinical needs. Our group recently developed a type I collagen-specific positron
emission tomography (PET) probe, 68Ga-CBP8, which was shown in animal models to detect pulmonary fibrosis
at an early stage and was capable of monitoring treatment response. Preliminary data with this probe in healthy
volunteers and IPF patients demonstrated that 68Ga-CBP8 had significantly higher uptake in IPF lungs than in
normal lungs. This data also showed that in addition to probe uptake in regions of lung with fibrosis as
established by HRCT, there were additional areas of probe uptake in radiographically “normal” lung suggesting
that the probe may be sensitive to lower levels of fibrosis than HRCT and/or sensitive to disease activity, i.e.
newly formed collagen. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the other hand can provide multiple readouts of
morphology, physiology, and function. Preliminary data from our lab using dynamic contrast enhanced-MRI
(DCE-MRI) in healthy controls and IPF subjects indicated that DCE parameters can distinguish abnormal from
normal lung, and that these measures may predict disease progression. Quantitative MRI-PET in lung has been
historically limited because of low proton density and the fast signal decay due to susceptibility artefacts at air-
tissue interfaces for MRI, while PET quantification remains challenging due to respiratory motion, photon
attenuation and regional variations in tissue, air and blood fractions. However, combining the two modalities
holds great potential to overcome some of these limitations. Our central hypothesis is that non-invasive molecular
imaging of collagen accumulation will allow us to capture the extent of ongoing lung injury in IPF patients and
that a bi-modal imaging approach using collagen-targeted PET augmented by DCE-MRI will enable more
accurate detection of disease activity and treatment response."

Advancements in prenatal genetic screening have significantly improved the identification of chromosomal
abnormalities and heritable conditions during pregnancy, yet current standards for patient education in this
domain are largely ineffective. Further, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends
prenatal care providers offer all women prenatal genetic screening in the first trimester of pregnancy,
regardless of age or genetic risk status. This has moved the focus of prenatal screening from a subset of higher
risk couples to all pregnant couples. Classically, information in the clinic has been transferred by written
materials and discussions with providers. This approach has a number of weaknesses, including limited time,
biases presented by provider perceptions of risk level, and limited genetic knowledge of clinicians. These
factors may also contribute to disparities in screening uptake among under-represented populations during
pregnancy. The most effective approach to education about prenatal screening, is one-on-one genetic
counseling, but due to the limited number of counselors this is not feasible, especially in rural and frontier
areas. New innovative education games offer promise to more effectively address gaps in healthcare decision-
making. About 59% of all Americans play video games and most of them play for at least three hours per
week. In fact, women age 18 or older represent a significantly greater portion of the game-playing population
(44%) than boys 18 or younger (17%). Game technology can display complex information in a culturally and
linguistically appropriate format to individuals of diverse educational backgrounds that make them ideal for
clinical settings especially among low health literacy populations. Aim 1: To compare the effectiveness of a
prenatal screening education game to improve knowledge and reduce decisional conflict among
underrepresented women with a diverse range of health literacy levels of pregnant women. Aim 2: To assess
the effectiveness of the prenatal screening education game to promote shared decision making with providers
compared to enhanced usual care (an interactive pdf of the clinic's brochure) or one-on-one genetic counseling
(in-person or tele-health). Aim 3: To compare the effectiveness of a prenatal screening education game to
improve knowledge and reduce decisional conflict among partners of pregnant women."

People living with HIV (PLWH) who use drugs are among the most vulnerable in the HIV continuum of care,
exhibiting low rates of retention in care and poor clinical outcomes. HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) often co-occur
due to shared vulnerabilities and routes of transmission including injection drug use, which is also associated
with risk for opioid overdose. PLWH who use drugs experience anticipated and enacted stigma in healthcare
settings, which contribute to poor clinical outcomes. Harm reduction (HR) is an approach that aims to reduce
the negative effects of risky health behaviors without necessarily eliminating them completely and is an
effective way of engaging people who use drugs into care. Though often thought of as structural approaches,
such as syringe services, harm reduction is also a relational approach to care that focuses on non-punitive,
autonomy-building relationships between patients and providers. This R01 will explore the degree to which
structural and relational HR approaches to care buffer experiences of stigma for PLWH who use drugs in HIV
primary care settings and improve the quality of patient-provider relationships as well as clinical outcomes. The
study will explore healthcare providers' attitudes towards working with PLWH who use drugs and the ways
these relate to their acceptance and practice of structural and relational HR. This will be accomplished via web-
based surveys (n=125) and qualitative interviews (n=20) with healthcare providers in Pittsburgh, PA and
Birmingham, AL. These methods will utilize a multi-level lens, engaging multiple provider types, such as social
workers, nurses, and physicians working in HIV primary care teams. Using an intersectionality framework, the
study will also assess the degree to which patients' perceptions of their HIV providers' HR care are associated
with anticipated and enacted stigma in HIV primary care settings and with clinical outcomes. Data will be
collected by surveying PLWH who use drugs (n=500) to explore if structural and relational HR mitigate stigma,
improve the patient-provider relationship, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes as measured via electronic
health records data including HIV viral load, retention in HIV primary care, HCV sustained virologic response,
medication adherence, and retention in care for Medications for Opioid Use Disorder and/or in behavioral
health treatment for substance use disorder. Study methods will include an evaluation of the psychometric
properties of the Patient Assessment of Providers Harm Reduction Scale (PAPHRS), a novel scale to measure
relational HR care. Finally, the study will apply human-centered design approaches to engage stakeholders in
reviewing findings from providers' and patients' experiences of HR care to develop an intervention to
operationalize HR care in HIV primary care settings. A preliminary exploration of the feasibility, acceptability,
and appropriateness of the newly-developed intervention will be conducted with HIV providers. Ultimately this
research trajectory aims to improve adherence to care and health disparities for PLWH who use drugs."
10825499,"In natural vision, recognizing objects based on the retinal image is challenging and is often an
ill-posed problem because a single image is compatible with multiple interpretations.
Nevertheless, the primate brain has a remarkable ability to understand ambiguous scenes and
solve difficult object recognition problems. Converging evidence suggests that this process,
especially in challenging contexts—e.g., occlusion or low-visibility environments—is based on
the integration of sensory information with prior knowledge built from experience. Our goal is to
develop circuit diagrams at a cellular level that specify how inter-areal interactions support the
integration of sensory signals related to the visual image with internal models that represent
prior knowledge, thereby revealing the computations that underlie scene understanding, object
recognition, and perceptual decision making in the primate brain. To achieve this goal, we have
assembled a synergistic team of experts to bring together, (i) viral-based circuit tracing and
optogenetic methods to identify connected neurons; (ii) multiphoton imaging and high-density
electrode recordings to functionally characterize neurons and signaling motifs in the awake
macaque monkey; (iii) behavioral manipulations and (iv) cutting-edge computational modeling to
reveal how systems of connected neurons across brain regions interact and support complex
perceptual processes. Our proposal includes four projects. In Project 1, PI Briggs will lead an
effort to establish circuit tracing protocols to support dense, reliable, and long-term tracking of
connected neurons in the macaque monkey. We will histologically compare lentivirus and
AAVretro constructs in terms of their efficacy, toxicity, directional reliability, layering, and spread
in labeling connected neurons, and we will test opto-tagging using high density
neurophysiology. In Projects 2 & 3, PI Bair will lead the effort to implement multiphoton imaging
in the awake monkey to identify projecting neurons in vivo during the simultaneous physiological
characterization of 100s of neurons down to a depth of ~1 mm in cortex. In Project 4, PI
Pasupathy will lead the effort to apply the viral methods and physiological characterization with
high-density neuropixels probes and multiphoton imaging to study neurons in visual cortex (area
V4), prefrontal cortex and the visual pulvinar as macaque monkeys perform shape detection in
impoverished images. PI Wu will lead the effort to interpret the population dynamics in the
context of communication subspace models and reveal how connected neurons in three brain
regions underlie the multiplexing of sensory signals and prior knowledge to facilitate object
detection and scene understanding."
10884274,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Heart failure (HF) affects millions of people and costs over 40 billion dollars annually in the United States
alone. Despite current pharmacotherapeutic approaches, which largely involve blockade of circulating
neurohormone activity, a diagnosis of HF carries a 5‐year mortality rate of nearly 50% underscoring the urgent
need for new treatments. The mitochondria have emerged as a central factor in the pathogenesis and
progression of HF with no therapies presently available to address mitochondrial dysfunction.
My goal in seeking a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award is to acquire
the necessary knowledge and practical training to make major advances in our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying cardiac energy metabolism and mitochondrial function in the adult heart. I hypothesize
that BRD4 (a ubiquitously expressed chromatin “reader” protein) complexes with GATA4 (a lineage
determining cardiac transcription factor) to regulate a mitochondrial bioenergetic gene program in
cardiomyocytes (Aim 1). I also hypothesize that GATA4 is a critical regulator of cardiac metabolism in
cardiomyocytes in vivo and that this tissue-enriched transcription factor is providing specificity to the action of
BRD4 (Aim 2). Finally, I hypothesize that a BRD4-GATA4 module controls the expression of PGC-1α and β,
known master transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial genes, to mediate the phenotype of cardiomyocyte
BRD4 loss (Aim 3). To address these aims, I will combine novel animal models that I have generated, standard
in vitro biochemical approaches, and advanced molecular biology and bioinformatics techniques. My long-term
goal is to develop a deeper molecular understanding of HF pathogenesis that may lead to novel therapies.
My graduate training provided me with important experience in cardiovascular research, however my focus
was on developmental biology. I am now directing my efforts towards studying adult cardiomyocyte
homeostasis—an area of interest that emerged from my clinical training in cardiology. My research mentor has
a long record of impactful discoveries using cutting-edge techniques in cellular and animal models of
cardiovascular disease. The research environment at the Gladstone Institutes/UCSF is exceptional and houses
state-of-the-art equipment and investigators making groundbreaking discoveries. I have assembled a team of
highly accomplished mentors and advisors to guide me through this next phase of my training on the path to
becoming an independent investigator. My training plan is specifically designed to provide me with mentorship
and research training in bioinformatics, mouse modeling of disease, and advanced techniques in molecular
biology. Beyond this, I will gain experience with other skills required to run a research group, such as scientific
communication and laboratory management. Completing the research and obtaining the skill sets outlined in
this proposal will prepare me well to obtain R01 or equivalent funding to begin my career as an independent
investigator."
10873960,"Project Summary/Abstract
The current opioid epidemic is a pressing public health crisis. A key precipitating factor of reuse and relapse
among people with opioid use disorders (OUD) is craving, or the intense, specific desire for the drug. While
craving has been extensively studied, and is known to predict drug use, we still lack an explanatory and
algorithmically-precise model that can directly link craving neurobiology to its observed consequences: the
decision to pursue drugs over other valuable alternatives. Given that typical treatments for OUD do not
adequately address craving and fail to prevent reuse in many patients, clarifying the precise, decision-relevant,
mechanism of craving may critically inform more targeted ways to treat craving and improve clinical outcome.
To address these important questions, we developed an experimental paradigm to study craving based on
methods widely used in decision neuroscience to assess value-based decision-making. Decision neuroscience
(or neuroeconomics) integrates concepts and methods from psychology, economics, and neuroscience to
understand the neural architecture for decision-making, and has been increasingly applied in mechanistic
studies of psychiatric disorders including addiction. Our paradigm constitutes a novel application of this
framework by quantifying a subject’s in-the-moment (i.e., state-dependent) decision process during craving15.
In pilot behavioral studies in healthy and opioid addicted subjects, we find that this paradigm captures 1) how
value—the key determinant of the decision to pursue a particular option versus another—changes under
craving, and 2) the selectivity of this effect to the object of craving. It also 3) provides an algorithmically-specific
process (a mathematical description) of this change that can be used to tie behavior to its neural substrate. In
the present study we aim to elucidate this neural substrate by identifying the specific neural computations
through which craving modulates the value of drug and nondrug alternatives and thereby drug use decisions in
human OUD. We propose to identify the neural substrate of opioid craving in N=89 OUD patients who will
complete our paradigm during fMRI in a within-subjects cross-over design following a brief craving induction or
a control manipulation16. Because decision circuits encode value in a reward-identity specific manner, our
design will enable us to isolate the computations associated with drug-related value from those of nondrug
value. Our study will for the first time determine whether and how experimentally-induced craving dynamically
shifts such “identity-specific” neural encoding of drug-related value (Aim 1), and the parts of a putative ‘craving
circuit’ involved in this shift (Aim 2). To test whether this mechanism is unique and reward-identity specific, we
will also measure brain activity associated with experimentally-induced food craving and specific food-value in
the same patients and N=89 healthy controls (Aim 3). If successful, this integrative approach will uncover
precise targets for selectively mitigating craving-induced increases in drug-value that promote opioid reuse,
laying the groundwork for precision interventions to treat craving in treatment unresponsive individuals."
10874548,"Our goal in this application is to test the hypothesis that neutralizing the newly identified immune-suppressive
regulator fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) in glioblastoma (GBM) following standard care chemotherapy will trigger
tumor-specific resident memory T cells in the brain (bTrm cells), which allows immunological clearance of
gliomas within the central nervous system and prevention of GBM recurrence. This hypothesis was raised based
on our recently published papers and newly established preliminary data. In brief, we have discovered that Fgl2
is highly expressed in GBM tissues (Yan et al, JNCI, 2015) and can transform low-grade brain tumors to GBM
(Latha et al, JNCI, 2018). Knockout of Fgl2 in tumor cells completely eliminates tumor progression in the brains
of immune-competent mice but not in immune-deficient mice (Yan et al, Nat Commun, 2019). Our unpublished
preliminary data have shown that neutralizing Fgl2 via administering T cells armed with a membrane-anchored
anti-Fgl2 scFv induces bTrm cells that reject intracranial tumor cell challenge directly or after intracranial
transplantation into naïve mice (see preliminary data section); the same mice are unable to reject tumors from
peripheral tissue challenge.
 To test our central hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: Aim 1: Determine how T-aFgl2–
neutralizing T-cell therapy induces bTrm cells in brains; Aim 2: Optimize the T-aFgl2–neutralizing cell
therapy and develop a next-generation T-aFgl2 cell therapy for boosting safety and therapeutic efficacy.
 Impact: This study will yield a therapeutic candidate—an Fgl2-neutralizing cell therapy that may
permanently prevent tumor recurrence—the key deadly cause of GBM patient death. Considering that Fgl2 can
be detected in almost all GBMs, with most having very high levels, this candidate therapeutic will be important.
This study will also further mechanistically elucidate how Fgl2-neutralizing cell therapy induces bTrm cells and
how we can make additional improvements to move this therapy into the next phase. Ultimately, this novel field
will transform the treatment of GBM."

10778585,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of flavivirus family that emerged as an infectious agent causing
global health crisis during recent epidemics. ZIKV infection can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome
in adults, and severe fetal neuromalformations and fetal death during pregnancy. ZIKV infection
is primarily transmitted by mosquito bite, while sexual transmission and vertical transmission from
infected pregnant women to fetus also contribute to the recent epidemic. Ideally, an effective ZIKV
vaccine should provide sterilizing immunity that blocks the initial viral dissemination to prevent
subsequent infection-caused morbidity. Currently, there is no approved ZIKV vaccine for disease
prevention. The membrane (M) and envelope protein (E) expressed as prM-E form is a common
antigen choice for current vaccine candidates against ZIKV, as neutralizing antibodies (nAb)
against prM-E can prevent viral entry. However, such nascent PrM-E based ZIKV vaccines can
increase the infectiousness of the dengue virus (DENV), another flavivirus of which endemic area
largely overlaps with ZIKV. Due to the high degree of sequence homology between the E proteins
of ZIKV and DENV, the ZIKV prM-E vaccine may stimulate the production of antibodies that are
non-neutralizing but cross-reactive with the DENV E protein. In the event of a subsequent dengue
virus infection, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) can occur when the suboptimal anti-
ZIKV antibodies bind to the DENV virus, which thereby enhance the entry of DENV into host cells
and exacerbate dengue symptoms. Strategies to prevent the induction of ADE-prone antibodies
have been described recently for modified ZIKV immunogens, which unfortunately display
suboptimal protection efficacy in small animals. Here, we focus on applying structure-based
vaccine design to develop novel vaccine candidates with improved immunogenicity and reduced
ADE potential for DENV infection. In preliminary study, our lead vaccine candidate formulated in
optimized adjuvant showed nearly complete protection in immune mice challenged with ZIKV,
and abolished ADE potential assessed by in vitro assays. Potent monoclonal ZIKV nAbs targeting
the major ZIKV E protein nAb determinants including the quaternary E-dimer dependent epitope
isolated from immune mice confirmed the design rationale. In this application, we will extend our
effort via further immunogen designs guided by B cell/antibody response analysis and structural
investigation of ZIKV E protein-antibody interactions to improve our lead vaccine candidate aiming
at achieving sterilizing immunity, to evaluate in small animal models. If succeeds, this study will
contribute to (i) the development of an effective and safe ZIKV vaccine, and (ii) deepening our
understanding of immune response to flavivirus infections and immunizations."
10818428,"Opioids have significant adverse effects highlighted by the large number of patients with opioid use disorder
(OUD) and the increasing number of overdose deaths in the United States and elsewhere. In just the 12-month
period ending in November 2021, more than 107,000 Americans died from drug overdose. Around 66% of these
deaths involved illicit synthetic opioids like fentanyl (approximately 50 times more potent than heroin and 100
times more potent than morphine), which is the primary driver of the opioid epidemic today. Many of the opioid
overdose deaths are attributed to fentanyl mixed with other illicit drugs like heroin, cocaine, and
methamphetamine. The potential lethal dose of fentanyl is around two milligrams, and it is particularly dangerous
for opioid naïve people who do not have a tolerance to opioids. Overdose deaths among high school-aged
Americans have more than doubled since 2019, which has been attributed to counterfeit pills (e.g., Xanax,
Percocet, Adderall) laced with a lethal amount of fentanyl. Sadly, many users often ingest the deadly drug
unknowingly. Unfortunately, there is not a happy ending for this devastating story and there is no easy solution
to the synthetic opioid problem. The vulnerability of our nation to the weaponization of highly potent fentanyl
analogs, such as carfentanil (20-fold more potent than fentanyl), poses a significant public health risk not only to
civilians, but also to first responders, law enforcement personnel, and the military. The relatively short duration
of action (DOA) of the mu-opioid receptor antagonists, naloxone and nalmefene, poses a major challenge for its
efficacy against fentanyl overdose. It is difficult to imagine how naloxone and nalmefene could be deployed
effectively in a mass casualty situation involving synthetic opioids (where duration of overdose could last up to
24 hr). The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a fundamentally novel drug delivery approach for extending
the DOA of currently FDA-approved opioid overdose antidotes (naloxone and nalmefene) for 24 hr or more. Here
we report the development of a new generation of opioid antagonist prodrugs as a countermeasure for synthetic
opioid overdose. The main advantages of our system include the following: (i) use of two FDA-approved
antidotes, naloxone and nalmefene, with well-established safety and efficacy profiles; (ii) potential to reverse
AND effectively protect against re-narcotization by synthetic opioid overdose; (iii) potential to avoid the
precipitation of opioid withdrawal symptoms; and (iv) ability to administer the prodrugs subcutaneously. The main
hypothesis of this proposal is to test whether conjugation of FDA-approved opioid antagonists through a
cleavable ester linker to a selective ligand for the serum protein, transthyretin (TTR), would allow us to generate
opioid antagonist prodrugs that are hydrophilic and can bind reversibly to TTR in serum. The balanced
hydrophilicity of prodrug will be important for achieving rapid absorption of the prodrug from the subcutaneous
tissue while binding to TTR would extend the DOA of the prodrugs."

Infertility is an important public health problem that affects up to 15% of reproductive-aged couples in the
United States. Black women experience infertility at approximately two times the rate of white women, yet are
less likely to seek medical care and have poorer fertility treatment outcomes. Despite this disparity,
epidemiologic research on infertility has largely been conducted among economically privileged white couples
seeking treatment at fertility clinics. Studies of fertility that enroll women during preconception or early
pregnancy have likewise had limited success in recruiting Black women. Thus, there has been virtually no
study of causes of infertility in Black women. Racial residential segregation and racialized patterns of
neighborhood investment and disinvestment have resulted in inequitable burdens of spatially-distributed
environmental exposures on communities of color. In the present proposal, we examine several exposures of
high relevance to Black women, with a focus on environmental and neighborhood-level exposures. We will use
data from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), the largest study in existence focusing on the health of
Black women. BWHS recruited 59,000 Black women from the United States in 1995 and have followed them
biennially for over 25 years. Outcome information was collected retrospectively in 2011, when women reported
information on time-to-pregnancy (TTP) for each of their planned pregnancies that ended in a live birth,
whether they had ever tried to conceive for >12 months without success, and if so, what cause was identified.
We will use these data to examine the association of TTP, infertility, and cause-specific infertility, with 1)
historical redlining, a 1930s government sponsored policy in which neighborhoods were classified by
investment risk based largely on the presence of Black residents, 2) residential racial and economic
segregation and neighborhood socioeconomic status, and 3) residential environmental exposures (including air
pollution, green space, and environmental noise). Finally, we will explore how redlining grades are associated
with patterns of neighborhood disadvantage and environmental pollution and how mixtures of social and
environmental exposures are related to fertility. Exposures will be derived from linkage between BWHS
participant addresses (collected biennially from 1995-2011) with geospatial data sets. The proposed study is
likely to have a large and sustained impact on the fields of reproductive epidemiology, environmental health,
and health disparities. The centering of Black women in infertility research advances health equity, combats
racist stereotypes that propagate the idea that infertility is a non-issue for Black women, and allows for the
identification of opportunities for intervention to reduce and eliminate infertility disparities. This will be the first
study to focus on causes of infertility in Black women, and is highly relevant for understanding how the
environment shapes human reproduction."

10813788,"ABSTRACT
Solute carrier (SLC) proteins are membrane transporters that govern the cross-membrane exchanges of glucose,
amino acids, inorganic ions, and other small molecule metabolites. Many SLC genes have been shown to be
causes of Mendelian diseases in humans, and a number of SLC transporters are important drug targets.
However, due to myriad technical difficulties, a large fraction of SLC family members are still orphan transporters
without known substrates, which represents both a significant knowledge gap and a huge opportunity for new
drug development. In order to systematically study the biochemical functions of the orphan SLC transporters, a
computational workflow was developed in our lab, which combines public transcriptomic and metabolomic
datasets to uncover the metabolic function of SLC transporters. Using this association analysis, an
uncharacterized gene, SLC45A4, was identified to be the single greatest determinant of γ-Aminobutyric acid
(GABA) levels in human cancer cells. GABA, which is mostly known as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
mammalian central nervous system, functions in peripheral tissues to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation,
and migration. Given the importance of these functions in both cancer and normal cells, it is essential to
understand how SLC45A4 functions in the context of GABA metabolism in non-neuronal cells. Using stable
isotope tracing, it was found that SLC45A4 increases cellular GABA levels not by promoting GABA uptake but
by facilitating GABA de novo synthesis, suggesting an entirely new mechanism of the regulation of GABA
synthesis. Therefore, it is hypothesized that SLC45A4 encodes a subcellular ornithine transporter that supports
GABA production. This program will move forward in three directions: Aim 1, determining the biochemical
mechanism by which SLC45A4 promotes cellular GABA production; Aim 2, determining the subcellular
compartmentalization of SLC45A4 transporter and GABA synthesis; and Aim 3, determining substrate
preference and enzymatic properties of SLC45A4. The overall goal is to determine how SLC45A4 regulates de
novo GABA synthesis, which contributes to the fundamental knowledge of human biochemistry and may provide
new therapeutics targeting GABA metabolism."
10806207,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the world. Changes in cardiac metabolic
substrate utilization underlie, and may play a causative role in, the development of heart failure. A
critical point of regulation in the ability of the heart to fully oxidize glucose is that of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase (PDH) complex that, in the heart, is negatively regulated by phosphorylation mediated
by two PDH kinases (PDK2 and PDK4). PDKs are differentially regulated in response to physiological
stimuli (e.g., exercise) and pathological stimuli (e.g., heart failure). Therefore, they represent likely
candidates for therapeutic intervention. However, early attempts to regulate the PDKs have not
fully tested the individual isoforms. A long-term goal of our laboratory is to understand the role of
these different isoforms in the progression of heart failure. Our preliminary data using germline knockout
mice for either of these isoforms in a pressure-overload induced model of heart failure, provides
compelling data for a protective role for loss of Pdk2, and an exacerbated role for loss of Pdk4.
Furthermore, our initial characterization identified several PDK isoform specific molecular
differences, including higher protein acetylation in Pdk2-/- hearts and a higher mortality in
Pdk4-/- mice. We also provide evidence to support a mechanism by which the differential acetylation is
targeted to the nucleus and may play a role in the histone code, linking it to epigenetic regulation
of gene expression. A critical barrier in determining the molecular mechanisms of these PDK isoforms
has been the ability to examine each individually. To overcome this barrier, we have generated
inducible cardiomyocyte specific knockouts to test the tissue-specific roles of these kinases in adult
hearts. The objective of the current proposal is to test the hypothesis that loss of PDK2, but not
PDK4, is cardioprotective through differential epigenetic (histone protein acetylation) and
transcriptional regulation in response to pressure-overload induced heart failure. We have developed
two novel mouse models to test this hypothesis. In this proposal we will: determine the role of each
PDK isoform in heart failure progression (Aim 1) and identify molecular mechanisms of these
differences (Aim 2). Collectively, the completion of these studies will provide fundamental insights into
the mechanistic basis for individual PDK isoforms in the regulation of cardiac gene expression
contributing to the development of heart failure."
10845562,"Project Summary/Abstract
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent form of lung cancer, accounting for approximately
85% of all lung cancers, which is one of the deadliest types of cancers. Standard NSCLC treatments include
surgery, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Radiation therapy can be delivered by either
photons or protons; however, both types of radiation therapy to the chest can result in cardiac injury. To date,
no available clinical tool exists to guide physicians in choosing the best type of radiation therapy according to an
individual’s risk for radiation-mediated cardiac injury. To plan radiation therapy, normal tissue complication
probability (NTCP) models are commonly used and take into consideration differences in geometric shape or
volumes between tumor and non-tumor tissue, as well as tissue dose constraints. However, these patient
population-reliant models are based only on photon radiation therapy data (not proton), do not consider the
differences in radiation vulnerability of organ substructures, and do not consider the individual NSCLC patient’s
risk for a specific toxicity (e.g., cardiac toxicity). Hence, this proposal tests the hypothesis that chemoradiation-
related cardiac toxicity can be minimized by dose optimization and individual pre-existing cardiovascular risk-
stratification for choosing appropriate radiation modality. Pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors, such as
individual genetic predisposition, cardiac injury blood biomarkers, and extent of vascular calcification will be
correlated with chemoradiation-associated cardiac toxicity and overall survival (OS) in Aim 1. Data on pre-
existing cardiovascular risk factors will be retrospectively collected from two prospective, randomized
comparisons of photons vs. protons and from a registry trial, which included proton-treated patients not enrolled
into the randomized trial. Associations between pre-existing cardiovascular events and radiation therapy-
mediated cardiac events as well as OS will be used as parameters to generate a one-of-a-kind NTCP model
(Aim 2). In Aim 3, a prospective cohort registration trial will be developed to longitudinally assess cardiac function,
cardiac fitness, and model implementation. During model implementation, two maximally optimized radiation
therapy plans for each enrolled patient will be developed: 1) using standard population-based dose constraints;
and 2) using personalized dose constraints based on individual risk. A predefined NTCP goal will be set to
evaluate both plans. If the personalized plan improves the NTCP goal by 15%, the patient will be treated using
the personalized plan. The model performance will be continuously assessed and improved using the data
accumulated from the trial. The long-term objectives of this proposed project are to minimize cardiovascular
injury while optimizing NSCLC patient outcomes, based on individual patient risk to cardiac injury after concurrent
chemoradiation therapy by multivariable model selection of radiation therapy modality and technique. Preventing
cardiovascular injury in cancer patients so that individuals can live longer, and more fulfilling lives is in direct
alignment with the mission of both the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute."

 This proposal describes a new PhD training program, Genetic Approaches to Development and Disease
(GADD) at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), which trains young scientists in the use of
modern genetics to address major challenges in biomedical research. There is an essential need for specific
training of PhD students in genetic approaches due to the prevalent use of genetically tractable model organisms,
the evolution of modern genetic techniques, and the complexities of genomic analyses in mammalian systems,
including human patients. The GADD program has been designed to meet this need.
 Students in the GADD program receive advanced training in genetic analyses using model organisms,
current genetic and genomic techniques, biostatistics, history of genetics, and the ethics of modern genetics.
The GADD training program functions as a highly selective training program that draws together dynamic, well-
funded faculty and outstanding students from departments and research centers across Columbia University
based on their thematic fit, rigorous research, and mentoring abilities. The training program features a rigorous
curriculum that emphasizes critical thought and development of writing and presentation skills, together with
regular feedback and individualized mentoring of each student. Trainees in our faculty training labs who have
graduated in the last five years show excellent training outcomes, with reasonable time-to-degree (just under 6
years), a high percentage of funding awards (26%) and first-author publications (97%), and successful research,
educational, or research-related careers (94%). A major goal of the GADD program is diversification of the
biomedical workforce through effective recruitment, retention, and support: URM students represent 16% of
current students. The proposed GADD training grant will provide academic, social, and career development
support to all of its students through structured training activities and close monitoring of student progress and
will replace the previous Genetics and Development (G&D) training grant. Overall, the GADD program
represents a premier genetics-focused graduate program that has a long track-record of success in training
leaders in biomedical research and a modern training plan to continue its contributions in the future."
10857167,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Controversy exists over the risk-to-benefit ratio of medical marijuana (MM) for adults with chronic non-cancer
pain (CNCP) on chronic opioid therapy (COT). Approximately 50 million adults in the United States suffer from
CNCP, a debilitating medical condition that is complex to manage. The majority of those with CNCP are
treated with COT, but the evidence supporting long-term effectiveness of opioid drugs for pain and improved
functional status is weak, and high-dose COT greatly increases risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid
overdose death. Because of the complex medical needs of this patient group, there has been enthusiasm over
the potential to treat CNCP with MM. However, evidence to support the effectiveness of MM to either treat
chronic pain, or to reduce opioid use, is weak, and there are risks associated with MM. Thus, the issue of
whether CNCP patients using opioids should use MM as an adjuvant therapy to COT remains controversial,
and there have been no randomized studies that have directly addressed this question. We propose to enroll
250 adults who endorse >6 months of CNCP with neuropathic pain, have received COT at a dose of 50-300
MME/day for >90 days, who have not used but are considering use of MM, and who report interest in tapering
their COT dose, into a randomized, pragmatic 3 site trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to begin MM
at enrollment or to a waitlist control condition (WL), and not initiate MM for 24 weeks. All participants will be
offered a 24-week, manualized behavioral prescription opioid taper support (POTS) program. We will evaluate
whether patients with CNCP on COT who are assigned to MM+POTS, compared with those assigned to
WL+POTS, show (1) greater COT dose reduction (MME/day), and/or greater improvement in pain severity on
a pain numeric rating scale (co-primary outcomes), (2) improved quality of life, (3) improved pain interference,
depression, and anxiety; and (4) improvement in cognitive functioning (working memory, attention, and
executive function performance), from baseline to 24 weeks. We will also assess the development of CUD in
those using MM. Urine collected at each visit will be assessed quantitatively for cannabis metabolites. The
proposed study will answer a timely and significant public health question regarding whether MM use with
behavioral support, compared to behavioral support alone, is beneficial or harmful for this population. This
information is critical for patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers to evaluate the risks and benefits of
MM as an adjuvant treatment to COT for CNCP."
10830986,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical failures in the management of pneumonia.
Pneumonia is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases, resulting in over 20,000 hospitalizations
and thousands of deaths across the VA system each year. For the past thirty years, the mainstays of
treatment have been antibiotics and supportive care, with little recognition of viral pathogens and the host
immune response. Our reliance on antibiotics has led not only to overuse and resistance, but also to a
stagnation in diagnostic and therapeutic research that left us ill-equipped for the viral pandemic.
Significance: The devastation of COVID19 has made it clear that our old models of disease are inadequate
for the optimal management of respiratory infection. Existing evidence surrounding empiric treatment in
pneumonia is poor, fraught with previous research that has been challenged by heterogeneity and a failure
to characterize patients with enough detail to identify beneficial treatment approaches. It is unlikely that
more of the same approach will advance care. This proposal contributes to a direction of clinical approach
toward a more complex causal model of infection that requires complex solutions.
Innovation and Impact: We will use state-of-the-art exploratory mixed methods that integrate EHR data
with survey and qualitative data to examine practice change. National analyses will allow for more inclusive
and feasible implementation solutions in diverse VA settings. This proposal breaks scientific ground in VA
informatics by leveraging variation with state-of-the-art causal inference methods. If we take the opportunity
to study new treatment approaches based on more complex clinical assessments, we will take an important
step toward developing better treatments in pneumonia and being better prepared for future pandemics.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. Describe emerging changes in the empiric use of antibiotic and steroids for
pneumonia using national practice data and qualitative interviews. Aim 2. Identify local conditions related to
emergent change in the use of empiric antibiotics and steroids using an exploratory mixed-methods design.
Aim 3. Identify and evaluate optimized, interpretable, tailored decision trees for empiric antibiotic and steroid
treatments in Veterans with pneumonia.
Methodology: Our mixed methods approach includes secondary data analyses of patient-, provider-, and
setting-level EHR data including treatment decisions and patient outcomes, combined with natural language
processing. We will apply mixed effects models to model the changes in selected treatments and outcomes
(hospitalization, deaths, secondary infection) between the pre-pandemic and later (July 2021-present)
periods, and to characterize heterogeneity in the trajectories of these variables across VA sites. To that
quantitative analysis, we will add qualitative data examining changes in VA providers’ cognitive processes
of diagnosis and management of pneumonia, including beliefs and norms surrounding treatment. We will
conduct configurational analyses and validate our analytic results with our expert advisory group for face
validity, feasibility and usefulness. We will then identify a optimized treatment regimes, in the form of
interpretable decision trees that minimize 30-day mortality, for empiric antibiotic and steroid use in Veterans
with pneumonia using machine-learning-based, causal inference algorithms, coupled with clinical expertise.
Next Steps/Implementation: Results will inform recommendations for the management of Veterans with
pneumonia that can be integrated with other evidence streams and disseminated by the national program
directors in the Advisory Group. We will produce recommendations for implementation strategies of
interventions in pneumonia care for Veterans that will be developed and tested in future work. We will also
produce recommendations for future research, including (1) pragmatic clinical trials; (2) creation of VHA-
approved living guidance for pneumonia care; and (3) decision support and other implementation strategies."

Anemia is a common but underappreciated complication of critical illness. While increased tolerance of anemia
has not been associated with negative short-term outcomes such as mortality, the impact on long-term
functional outcomes (physical function, cognition, mental health, quality of life) remains unknown. Impairments
in these functional domains are highly prevalent and debilitating in survivors of critical illness, and the
identification of modifiable risk factors has been recognized as a key priority in critical illness research.
The long-range goal of the applicant is to become a successful independent translational clinician-scientist
leading a multidisciplinary team to optimize patient recovery after critical illness. The scientific objectives of
this application are to: 1) identify patients at highest risk for impaired recovery from anemia after critical
illness; 2) assess the relationships between persistent post-hospitalization anemia and functional outcomes;
and 3) to test the feasibility and impact of a novel anemia prevention and treatment intervention on post-
hospitalization functional outcomes. The training goals of the applicant are to obtain training and expertise in
biostatistics and data science, multi-dimensional functional outcome assessment, and pragmatic clinical trial
design and implementation science.
Aim 1. To assess patterns and consequences of anemia recovery in the first year after critical illness
• Recovery from anemia after critical illness remains incompletely characterized. In this aim, epidemiologic
 data from a large cohort of ICU survivors will be utilized to evaluate hemoglobin recovery after critical
 illness. Advanced statistical and data science approaches will be used to identify unique profiles of
 hemoglobin recovery, predict patients at high risk for impaired recovery, and assess the relationships
 between hemoglobin recovery and functional outcomes in the first year after hospitalization.
Aim 2. To perform a pilot pragmatic clinical trial testing a multi-faceted anemia intervention (optimized
phlebotomy practice, clinical-decision support, targeted pharmacologic anemia treatment) to attenuate
anemia development and promote functional recovery in the setting of critical illness
 • The impact of anemia treatment interventions on functional outcomes after critical illness has not been
 defined. This aim will employ a pilot clinical trial testing the feasibility and efficacy of a novel multi-faceted
 anemia intervention aimed at attenuating and treating anemia during critical illness for the modification of
 hemoglobin levels and post-hospitalization functional outcomes (i.e. 3 and 6 months after hospitalization)."
10863902,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The United States is in the midst of a public health crisis due to the ongoing opioid syndemic. The opioid syndemic
consists of the inter-related epidemics of opioid misuse, fatal and non-fatal overdose, human immunodeﬁciency
virus (HIV), and hepatitis C (HCV). The consequences of opioid misuse are particularly severe in Ohio as the
state has experienced overdose rates that are double the national average as well as elevated risk for epidemic
levels of HIV and HCV. A key need for addressing the syndemic is to improve surveillance science methodology
to better measure community-levels of opioid misuse and be able to identify and target areas of emerging risk
with resources. However, no single data source currently observed by the public health surveillance system fully
characterizes opioid misuse at relevant spatial and temporal supports. Novel statistical methods are needed to
better leverage existing data and appropriately integrate multiple imperfect surveillance outcomes across different
spatial scales to comprehensively estimate levels of opioid misuse and model the syndemic over space and time.
Doing so will enable estimation and inference at small areas that are relevant to local policymakers and public
health ofﬁcials while accounting for measurement error. There are several methodological challenges that will
be overcome with achievement of the following aims: 1) develop and assess a spatio-temporal factor model
that estimates a factor that can be meaningfully interpreted longitudinally, 2) develop and assess a spatial factor
model that allows for outcomes to have different spatial supports, and 3) develop and assess a multivariate spatio-
temporal model to estimate areal prevalence of latent opioid misuse. Successful development of a comprehensive
model of the opioid syndemic will advance surveillance science and will produce estimates of opioid misuse
that advance epidemiological understanding and provide valuable information to policymakers and public health
ofﬁcials."

Highly trained and experienced Core B laboratory personnel will be responsible for automated meiotic mapping
(AMM) of mutations that alter the T1D phenotype in NOD/NckH mice (either suppressing or augmenting the
normal course of T1D development). AMM is necessary for the rapid identification of single nucleotide changes
responsible for phenotypes. DNA will be sent from Core C by express mail at monthly intervals, and phenotyping
data will be transmitted by direct data upload on a weekly basis. Core B will first identify all coding/splicing
mutations in each pedigree. Then, within each pedigree, Core B will genotype DNA from all G2 and G3 mice at
pedigree-specific mutation sites to determine the zygosity of induced mutations in every mouse. Because two
separate sequencing platforms are used to detect mutations (Illumina) and to genotype mutations (Ion Torrent),
the latter process being performed on many individual mice, the rate of false positive mutations is essentially
zero. Genotyping errors are also exceedingly rare. Genotyping failure (as distinct from error) occurs for ~2-3%
of targeted loci, requiring a second attempt using capillary sequencing. The computational arm of Core B will
use statistical computation, carried out on a local computer with 192 parallel processors, to identify all mutations
causative of phenotype, whether they augment or suppress T1D. Software written for the parsing and display of
AMM data will assure that no causative mutation goes unnoticed. Using the machine-learning program
Candidate Explorer (CE), written for precisely this task, Core B will designate certain mutations for verification
studies (performed in Project 2) and mechanistic studies (performed in both Project 1 and Project 2). Core B
has also developed another mission-specific software tool that permits detection of epistatic interactions between
mutations. This program will determine whether interactions are additive, synergistic, or antagonistic. It will also
determine whether these effects are, in the case of each mutation, dominant, recessive or additive. The causative
mutations identified in Core B will be interpreted in light of phenotypic studies of >230,000 mutations presently
in the Mutagenetix database that were tested for immunologic effects. Just as a Coro1a mutation was shown to
abolish the development of T1D (see Overall), we anticipate that mutations in many lesser-known genes may
have inhibitory or augmenting effects. The Mutagenetix database will help guide our general approach to
mechanism across the P01. We will explore immunologically significant mutations mechanistically with the
hypothesis that they operate in cells of the immune system. The data developed in Core B will be publicly
available on the Mutagenetix database through the CE program. A public version of CE is already available to
display FACS data and will be adapted for the display of T1D modifier data in the course of this P01 project."
10861753,"Our proposed research focuses on defining factors that limit antibiotic sensitivity of the chronic pathogen Heli-
cobacter pylori. Evidence suggests that chronic H. pylori is difficult to cure with antibiotics because it is in a
slow growth state controlled at least in part by stomach acid. H. pylori treatments rely on removing acid by in-
cluding strong antacids called proton pump inhibitors (PPI). The PPI blocks acid production, raises the stom-
ach pH, and promotes H. pylori growth. Bacterial growth allows standard antibiotics to work better. There is a
gap in our understanding of the exact nature of the H. pylori chronic growth state, e.g. how active its metabo-
lism is, whether acid is the only growth inhibitor, and what type of metabolism H. pylori deploys to grow after
PPI treatment. This information is important because H. pylori infections are treated at the chronic state. Mil-
lions of people worldwide and in the U.S. are infected by H. pylori and suffer from its associated diseases—
ulcers and gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. H. pylori is an
on-going problem, as the incidence has stabilized in the developed world. Furthermore, current therapies to
cure H. pylori infection fail with unacceptable frequency: recent estimates in the United States have found that
20-25% of infected individuals are not cured by the current therapeutic regime. The overall objective of this ap-
plication is to understand the H. pylori chronic growth state and use this information to design approaches that
enhance growth and therefore antibiotic sensitivity. Our central hypothesis, based on published and preliminary
data, is that the majority of chronic-state H. pylori are in an extreme slow growth mode, limited by a
combination of acid, translational deficiency, and nutrient restriction. In Aim 1, we will use a combination of H.
pylori mutants and mouse models to fill gaps in our understanding of the H. pylori chronic growth state and
growth rate, how these parameters are affected by PPI, and whether post-PPI multiplication requires lactate
utilization as early stage multiplication does. Additionally, we test whether increasing key carbon sources like
lactate enhances H. pylori chronic state growth and antibiotic cure. In Aim 2, we build on preliminary data
showing slow growth H. pylori display significant translational repression, including by increase in the riboso-
mal silencing factor RsfS. We use molecular biology and biochemistry to fill gaps in our understanding of RsfS
function in general, and to characterize how controlled RsfS expression, as well as other translational inhibi-
tors, controls translation and affect chronic colonization. The proposed research is innovative in its hypothesis
that H. pylori chronic slow growth is promoted by signals in addition to acid, and that knowing and targeting
these will promote better cures. The proposed research is significant because it will provide new insights into
ways that chronic growth is controlled and provide new ways to enhances H. pylori antibiotic sensitivity. The
long-term outcomes generated by this research will provide insights that will lay the groundwork for improved
therapies that push these microbes into an antibiotic-sensitive state."

Pancreatic beta cells secrete insulin in order to maintain blood glucose homeostasis. Insulin secretion is tightly
regulated by glucose and modulated by numerous environmental signals, including other nutrients, hormones,
and inflammatory cytokines. Exposure of beta cells to environmental signals affects gene regulatory programs
within hours, and these signal-dependent changes serve to adapt insulin secretion to changes in organismal
states. Genetic variants associated with measures of insulin secretion are strongly enriched in genomic elements
active in beta cells, and many of these variants are also associated with risk of diabetes. Beta cells therefore
possess characteristics that make them an ideal cellular model for studying signal-dependent gene regulatory
processes relevant to human health and disease. However, the specific genomic programs that drive signal-
induced state changes in beta cells remain poorly characterized. Recent advances in the development of human
pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived multi-cellular islet organoid models by us and others provide a genetically
tractable beta cell model for linking genomic activity to cellular phenotypes. Our group has further pioneered the
development of numerous single cell assays, including chromatin accessibility, ultra-high-throughput paired
chromatin accessibility and gene expression, and paired 3D chromatin interactions and DNA methylation;
methods that we have successfully applied to both primary human islets and hPSC-islet organoids. We have
further developed machine learning and network-based approaches for variant interpretation including from
single cell RNA and epigenetic data. In this proposal we will develop novel gene regulatory network (GRN)
models to predict network-level relationships among genomic elements, genes, and phenotypes derived from
single cell multiomic maps charting signal- and time-dependent changes in hPSC-islet organoids. In Sections
B and C we will measure genomic element activity, gene expression, and insulin secretion in hPSC-islet
organoids exposed to ten different secretory signals each across four time points using paired single nucleus
accessible chromatin and gene expression and paired single cell DNA methylation and 3D chromatin architecture
assays. In Section D we will generate a GRN from these data, use machine learning to infer element-gene and
element-phenotype relationships and use the trained models to refine the GRN. From the resulting GRN we will
predict the effects of genetic variants in specific genomic elements on target gene expression, gene network
activity, and cellular phenotype. In Section E we will validate and refine models by using medium-scale CRISPR
interference of genomic elements individually and in combination as well as allele-specific gene editing of
selected glucose-associated variants in hPSC-islet organoids and measuring gene expression changes in cis
and trans. Together, the results, data, and methods from this project using a model of a cell type which both
rapidly responds to environmental signals and has a quantifiable phenotypic output will be widely applicable to
the community studying the dynamics of genomic regulation."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal disease with very few clinical options. Recent work from our lab and
others indicates that abnormal signal transduction, originating from oncogenic drivers and loss of tumor
suppressors, results in heightened glycolytic flux in GBM. Correspondingly, inhibition of oncogenic signaling or
downstream signal transduction pathways using targeted therapies can induce rapid and specific alterations in
glycolysis, resulting in reduced tumor energetic and biosynthetic capacity, making the tumor vulnerable to further
therapeutic exploitation. Such an imaging biomarker would be useful for providing unique insight into glucose
metabolism and behavior, allowing clinicians to identify and ultimately exploit potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.
While 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET imaging is an obvious candidate biomarker for imaging glycolysis
as it is used ubiquitously in other cancers to monitor tumor metabolic behavior and treatment response, 18F-FDG
PET uptake is a measure of overall glucose utilization, not specifically glycolysis. To overcome this ambiguity
and provide more specificity for glycolysis, we propose combining standard of care 18F-FDG PET with fast pH
and oxygen-sensitive amine chemical exchange saturation transfer spin-and-gradient-echo echoplanar imaging
(CEST-SAGE-EPI), a molecular MRI technique that can estimate both acidity from lactic acid and oxygen
utilization, as well as perfusion and diffusion MRI to account for the effects of blood flow/volume and cell density.
We hypothesize combining 18F-FDG PET, amine CEST-SAGE-EPI, perfusion MRI, and diffusion MRI to create
a “glycolytic index”, or GI, will allow us to accurately quantify glycolytic flux within heterogeneous tumors on
widely available clinical imaging systems for use in studying glucose metabolism and response to a variety of
targeted therapies in human GBM.
 The current study will investigate the central hypotheses that: (Aim 1) biopsied tumor tissue undergoing high
levels of glycolysis via RNA expression, protein expression, and bioenergetics analyses can be reliably detected,
correlates with direct measure of tissue pH, and strongly associated with a “glycolytic index” created by

10835999,"ABSTRACT
Although the past decade was marked by the tremendous success of immunotherapeutics in oncology, few have
provided significant benefit to patients with pancreatic cancer. The long-term goal of this project is to develop
therapeutically useful immunotherapies for the clinical treatment of pancreatic cancer. The overall objectives
in this application are to (i) characterize the role for MARCO in the TME, (ii) to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy
of antibodies blocking this receptor, and (iii) improve antigen presentation within the pancreatic TME with a
combination of Fc-enhanced antibodies targeting MARCO and CD40. Our central hypothesis is that pancreatic
cancer repolarizes tumor associated macrophages to an M2 phenotype an this can be reversed through
engagement of MARCO with antibodies, therefore promoting anti-tumor responses. The rationale for this project
is that a determination of the immunosuppressive role of TAMs expressing MARCO in pancreatic cancer will
likely offer a strong scientific framework whereby new immunotherapies can be developed. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Develop anti-human TAM antibodies for cancer
immunotherapy and set up novel assays for large-scale evaluation of anti-TAM antibodies, 2) Define the role for
MARCO in the polarization of TAMs in pancreatic cancer, and 3) Augment TAM repolarization in the pancreatic
cancer TME using the Fc-enhanced CD40 agonist antibody 2141-V11, alone or in combination with anti-
hMARCO antibodies.. Under the first aim, novel antibodies will be generated against human MARCO and
optimized for Fc-receptor binding. In the second Aim, mice genetically engineered to express human MARCO
will be studied for their role in the TME of pancreatic cancer. Following characterization immune cells expressing
MARCO that can be targeted by antibody therapy, a panel of antibody variants will be tested to determine the
Fc-requirements for optimal in vivo activity. MARCO expression and characterization of the immune
microenvironment will also be evaluated in human pancreatic cancer specimens. Finally, in the third aim, we will
use knowledge gained in Aims 1 and 2 to test novel combinations targeting the myeloid axis in pancreatic tumors.
Here, the anti-tumor activity of the Fc-enhanced anti-CD40 antibody will be tested alone or in combination with
anti-MARCO antibodies in pancreatic cancer models. The research proposed in this application is innovative,
in the investigator’s opinion, because it focuses on defining novel pathways on myeloid cells contributing to the
immune suppressive TME of pancreatic cancer, while identifying lead therapeutic candidates through Fc-
engineering. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification
for the development of macrophage targeting immunotherapies. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential of
offering new opportunities for the translation of innovative therapies to the treatment of pancreatic cancer."
10880262,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Cancer survivors have unique healthcare needs including risk for serious late effects,
ongoing surveillance, lifestyle modifications to reduce second cancer risk, and psychosocial support. Nearly
70% are considered “complex cancer survivors” because they have at least one comorbid chronic condition in
addition to cancer. Comorbidities pose significant challenges to the delivery of quality cancer care because they
adversely affect and are affected by cancer treatment. Medically underserved patients have the highest burden
of multiple chronic conditions and are at increased risk for poor outcomes during and after cancer treatment. As
medically underserved complex cancer patients may lack healthcare knowledge and access to supportive care,
their health outcomes and care transitions might be improved by enhancing communication and collaboration
between their oncologists and primary care providers (PCPs). This study tests and evaluates a novel shared
care model for complex cancer survivors called OPTIMISE (Oncology-Primary Care Partnership to Improve
Comprehensive Survivorship Care) in the largest safety-net healthcare system in Houston, TX. Three-hundred
newly diagnosed breast, GI, and hematological cancer patients who are being treated with curative intent and
who have comorbidities requiring ongoing management during cancer treatment will complete baseline surveys
and be randomized to either OPTIMISE or Usual Medical Care (UMC). Patients receiving UMC will receive their
cancer treatment, as directed by their oncologist, a survivorship care plan (SCP) at the end of active treatment,
and surveillance visits with their oncologist based on national guidelines. Patients in OPTIMISE will 1) have an
oncology nurse navigator assigned to their care team at diagnosis to facilitate oncologist-PCP communication
and continuity of care; 2) receive coordinated care between their oncologist and PCP throughout cancer
treatment and surveillance facilitated by a structured communication and referral process; 3) receive a
survivorship care plan (SCP) at the end of treatment that incorporates comorbidity management; and, 4) receive
a risk-stratified shared care model of post-treatment surveillance where one or more routine oncologist follow-
up visits is replaced by a PCP visit. AIM 1 evaluates the impact of OPTIMISE on patient chronic disease self-
management (primary outcome) and quality of life (secondary outcome). Aim 2 explores the effects of OPTIMISE
on healthcare use and patient unmet needs during and after active cancer treatment. Aim 3 examines the effects
of OPTIMISE on oncologist and PCP attitudes and coordination of care. Aim 4 seeks to elucidate patient- and
system-level factors that may influence implementation outcomes. OPTIMISE shifts the timing of thinking about
survivorship to point of diagnosis and seeks to develop a clinical infrastructure to support continuity of care from
cancer diagnosis through post-treatment survivorship. If found effective, OPTIMISE could be expanded to other
cancers, igniting a potentially rich area of research. It may also have significant downstream impact in other
medical settings by enhancing care transitions from specialty to primary care."
10870060,"Emerging research is providing compelling evidence that the vestibular system contributes not only to basic
reflexes (e.g. vestibulo-ocular, postural) but also to complex cognitive processes including spatial memory
and navigation; self-motion perception and motor planning; and executive function. Vestibular function
declines with healthy aging, and studies from our group and others have shown that vestibular loss in aging
adults is associated with known age-related reductions in cognitive skills including spatial memory and
navigation ability, and self-motion perception and motor planning. In a pilot study supported by the NIDCD,
we found that older adults with vestibular loss had reduced hippocampal volumes, as well as atrophy of
subfields of the thalamus and the basal ganglia. During this pilot study, our group built a pipeline for analysis
of neuroimaging data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) at the Center for Imaging
Science (CIS) in the Johns Hopkins Department of Biomedical Engineering. We established the
computational infrastructure for both volumetric analysis and shape analysis. In this proposal, we seek to
leverage this infrastructure to more comprehensively investigate the impact of aging on three core central
vestibular pathways, and examine the link between structural changes in these pathways and functional
changes in clinical skills mediated by these pathways. Specifically, we aim to: Aim 1 Investigate the
relationship between peripheral vestibular sensory loss associated with aging and the structure of central
vestibular pathways, specifically considering 3 primary central vestibular pathways: 1) spatial cognitive; 2)
sensorimotor; 3) prefrontal cortex (executive function). Aim 2 Examine the longitudinal relationships
between peripheral vestibular loss and structural changes in central vestibular pathways using longitudinal
models and also the novel change-point model in aging adults. Aim 3 Explore the association between
structural changes in central vestibular pathways and clinical functional changes cross-sectionally and
longitudinally. This proposal represents a unique opportunity to leverage strengths in vestibular physiology
and computational neuroimaging to increase our fundamental understanding of the impact of healthy aging
on central vestibular networks, and associated clinical consequences. Findings from this study will be used
to drive further critical research questions, including 1) Does vestibular loss contribute to the accelerated
decline in cognitive ability and brain structure that occurs in individuals with cognitive impairment and
Alzheimer’s disease; and 2) Can vestibular interventions for vestibular loss prevent/mitigate changes in
central vestibular pathways?"

10834248,"Summary/Abstract
Ascending acetylcholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulatory systems are thought to alter information
processing in cerebral cortex with spatial and temporal precision (Obermayer et al., 2017). Yet we lack basic
information about how these systems affect neural responses underlying perception and decision-making in
sensory cortex of awake, behaving subjects. The overarching goal of this project is to investigate how cholinergic
and noradrenergic inputs to visual cortex are activated during a visual detection task. Genetically coded
neurotransmitter reporters (GRAB-Ach, GRAB-NE) are novel tools that can measure local neurotransmitter
concentrations in cortex with sub-second resolution. These newly developed genetically coded neurotransmitter
reporters offer an unprecedented window into real-time changes in local neurotransmitter concentration during
perceptual decision-making. Aim 1 will define the relationship of ACh and NE neurotransmitter concentrations
in primary visual cortex to behavioral decision variables. Aim 2 will define the relationship of ACh and NE
neurotransmitter concentrations in primary visual cortex to the fidelity of the neural representation. This work
will provide preliminary data for larger scale studies that examine the effect on neurotransmitter concentrations
of manipulating cognitive variables such as attention, decision-making, and working memory. These initial
experiments will set the stage for future studies that manipulate neurotransmitter concentrations with systemic
or intracranial drug injections to test causal relationships between neurotransmitters and behavioral
performance."
10804692,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common modification in mRNA and regulates gene expression.
Modulation of m6A profiles is associated with cancer progression and chemotherapeutic drug resistance.
However, it remains unknown how m6A is involved in the processes. Understanding the underlying mechanisms
is the key to the discovery of new drug targets and biomarkers for cancer therapy and diagnosis. Recent studies
have pointed to a new role of m6A in regulating RNA-guided DNA repair suggesting that it can mediate cancer
development by interplaying with DNA damage and repair. We recently found that an m6A located next to the
stop codon on the transcript of DNA polymerase β (Pol β) was eliminated by oxidative RNA base damage
induced by the environmental toxicant, potassium bromate (KBrO3), shifting its deposition to the upstream of the
Pol β transcript. We hypothesize that m6A interplays with RNA and DNA base damage to regulate DNA repair.
To test this hypothesis, we will pursue two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to determine if m6A profiles and abundance
can be modulated by RNA and DNA base damage in cancer cells. First, we will determine if oxidative RNA and
DNA base damage can disrupt the profiles of m6A on the Pol β transcript in cancer cells. This will be tested in
HeLa cells treated with KBrO3. We will determine if m6A profiles can be modulated by oxidative RNA base
damage, 8-oxoG, and abasic sites (AP sites) on the Pol β transcript using DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation
(DRIP)-mediated strand break-mediated RNA modification profiling assay (DRIP-SBRM). We will then determine
if the m6A profiles can be altered by DNA base damage, 8-oxodGs, and AP sites on the DNA template of Pol β
transcript using the DRIP-mediated strand break-mediated DNA modification profiling assay (DRIP-
SBDM). Second, we will determine if RNA and DNA base damage can alter the activity and substrate binding
affinity of the m6A writer and eraser, METTL3/METTL14 and FTO. Aim 2 is to determine if m6A can alter the
accumulation of RNA base damage to modulate DNA repair in cancer cells. First, we will determine if the profiles
of oxidative DNA and RNA base damage on the Pol β transcript can be modified by m6A under METTL3
deficiency in HeLa cells. The effects of m6A on the profiles of oxidative DNA and RNA base damage induced by
KBrO3 will be determined using HeLa cells with or without METTL3 gene knockdown. The profiles of m6A and
oxidative base damage on the Pol β transcript and its template DNA will be correlated. Second, we will determine
if the activity and substrate binding affinity of the key BER enzymes can be modulated in an m6A and RNA
damage location-dependent manner. The study will prove the new concept that epitranscriptomic modifications
interplay with RNA and DNA base damage to regulate DNA repair in cancer cells. The results will reveal a novel
paradigm for m6A to interplay with oxidative RNA and DNA damage to modulate DNA repair that underlies cancer
progression. Thus, the study will facilitate the discovery of new targets for RNA-based treatment, diagnosis, and
prevention of environmentally-induced cancer."
10754295,"The aim of my research is (1) to elucidate the cognitive and neural bases of human memory, through a
detailed characterization of the memory deficits seen in patients with medial temporal lobe (MTL) amnesia
secondary to neurological disorders such as encephalitis, stroke, or anoxic injury and through neuroimaging
studies of individuals with intact memory; and (2) to elucidate the clinical impact of memory disorders in a
variety of syndromes in which memory is one of the presenting complaints.
With regard to the first aim, prior findings from our laboratory have demonstrated that impairments in
autobiographical memory are accompanied by parallel impairments in imagining hypothetical or future events.
My current work builds on these findings and aims to elucidate how impairments in future thinking impact other
aspects of cognition, including decision making and language processing. We have examined decisions
pertaining to future outcomes as well as pertaining to outcomes in the present, and ongoing work aims to
further characterize these deficits in domains as diverse as perceptual decisions, preferences about food, and
moral decisions. Prior work has also focused on aspects of expressive language, and we now focus on
aspects of language comprehension. In addition to characterizing the scope of these cognitive deficits, my
work aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these impairments, focusing on the role of the hippocampus
in relational processing, scene construction, and updating of information. In a variety of studies, we
systematically vary demands on these processes and see how they impact the performance of amnesic
patients.
With regard to the second aim, my work has focused on OEF/OIF/OND Veterans, who often present with co-
morbid traumatic brain injury (TBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Because my earlier work
indicated that psychiatric co-morbidities play a major role in the cognitive and behavioral sequelae these
individuals experience, my current work focuses specifically on the impact of PTSD-associated memory
alterations on various aspects of cognition. Individuals with PTSD tend to retrieve memories that are
overgeneral and are biased towards negative information. We postulate that these characteristics have critical
ramifications for different aspects of future-oriented behavior and decision making in PTSD. The goals of this
work are to document the scope of these alterations, to examine their underlying neural basis through the use
of functional neuroimaging, and to establish the feasibility of optimizing future-oriented behavior through
information processing manipulations that are known to influence future thinking in healthy individuals."
10909975,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic skin wounds like diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a serious medical problem in Veterans. Up to one third
of patients with diabetes develop DFU, a leading cause of lower leg amputations as well as skin and bone
infections and an independent risk factor for death. As current therapies are limited and often ineffective, there
is a critical need to better understand pathogenesis in order to identify new and improved therapies for chronic
wounds in diabetes and other disease states. Repetitive skin injury and skin inflammation are independently
implicated in DFU pathogenesis; however, gaps in knowledge exist regarding how skin injury and inflammation
interact in diabetic (and healthy) skin and how this interaction could impair wound healing. We recently
identified an inflammatory response that is activated by mechanical skin injury and refer to this as the skin
injury-induced inflammatory response. Our preliminary data suggest the IL-1 signaling initiates this response
and contributes to DFU pathogenesis. The objective of this project is to determine how IL-1 signaling regulates
the skin injury-induced inflammatory response and contributes to normal wound healing as well as impaired
wound healing in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes. Our central hypothesis is IL-1 signaling activates the skin
injury-induced inflammatory response and promotes scarring during normal and diabetic wound healing and
that dysregulated IL-1 signaling amplifies inflammation and impairs diabetic wound healing. Aim 1 will
determine the role of keratinocyte-derived IL-1 and IL-1 receptor signaling during normal skin wound healing in
mice and determine if disrupting IL-1 signaling reduces scarring and enhances normal wound healing. Aim 2
will examine the role of IL-1 and IL-1 receptor signaling in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus and
determine if disrupting IL-1 signaling enhances diabetic wound healing. Aim 3 will use ex vivo-cultured human
skin from healthy and diabetics subjects to define the contributions of IL-1 and blood sugar control to the skin
injury-induced inflammatory response transcriptome in whole skin tissue and at the level of single cells. This
project will define the role of IL-1/IL-1R1 axis activation on skin injury-induced inflammation in healthy and
diabetic human and mouse skin and the consequences of IL-1/IL-1R1 signaling during wound healing. This
coupled with identification of new molecular targets during these studies will facilitate further research and
development of new therapies to promote wound healing in diabetes and other disease states."
10889056,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The American College of Rheumatology launched the RISE registry in 2014. RISE is a federally Qualified
Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) that passively collects data from the EHRs of participating providers,
aggregates and analyzes data centrally and continuously feeds back performance on quality measures to
practices via a web-based dashboard. RISE has grown into one of the largest rheumatology registries in the
world, with 2 million patients with 20 million encounters. However, research is needed to quantify RISE's
impact on quality and outcomes and to explore the specific mechanisms by which its health IT infrastructure
influences clinical practice. The proposed study will employ a mixed methods approach to examine variations
in use of the RISE registry web-based dashboard and explore the consequences of this variation on quality of
care and clinical outcomes. We will focus on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most common inflammatory arthritis
affecting 1.3 million Americans, and an area with several nationally-endorsed quality measures. Our central
hypothesis is that participation and active engagement with the data and tools available on the RISE
dashboard leads to improvements in quality and outcomes over time. The proposed Impact of Registry Use
on Quality and Outcomes in Rheumatology (QORA) project aims include 1) analyzing physician and
practice-level variation in patterns of RISE dashboard use by analyzing the extensive audit-log data in the
RISE data warehouse; 2) investigating the impact of participation and engagement with the RISE registry on
quality of care and clinical outcomes, and 3) identifying strategies for redesigning tools available on the RISE
dashboard to improve its usability and its effectiveness for local quality improvement. For this last aim, we will
perform a series of semi-structured interviews and field observations with users of RISE in different
rheumatology practice settings and work with a team of human-centered design experts. The proposed work
will allow us to generate evidence to improve RISE and maximize its impact on quality of care and outcomes
for people with rheumatic diseases. The study will also generate data to support a core public health priority for
NIAMS: improving the quality of rheumatologic care delivery in the U.S."
10890009,"Latino families are disproportionately affected by obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, and dyslipidemia. Diet is a major contributing factor and poor diet is heavily driven by environmental
cues, including large restaurant portions and aggressive marketing of low-nutrient, highly processed and high
sugar foods. This is especially true in low-income neighborhoods where marketing and availability of unhealthy
foods is more salient. Furthermore, the marketing, discounts and promotional strategies in supermarkets often
nudge shoppers to buy low-nutrient discretionary foods or buy in excessive quantities. One promising approach
to address these nutritional, social, and economic contributors to disparities in chronic disease risk is the concept
of food prescriptions, which includes menu planning and home-delivery of affordable and nutritious food. This
approach is premised on modifying contextual cues in the home environment rather than relying on self-
regulatory control. Project 3 will test the effects of a culturally sensitive meal planning and affordable grocery
delivery service in a randomized controlled trial to improve diet quality, weight control and chronic disease risk
among multi-generational Latino households. Food prescriptions will meet the EAT-Lancet sustainability
guidelines and achieve at least 90% of the recommended dietary allowances for 23 critical nutrients for all family
members, at a cost not exceeding $680/month, the current CalFresh (California’s SNAP) budget for a family of
four. We will include tailored directions on portion size based on age, sex, activity level and weight goals. We
will develop and validate our menus and test logistics with focus groups of Latino adults with overweight or
obesity. Thereafter, we will enroll 180 Latino households of 3-5 people (n=720) from Kaiser Permanente
members with at least two individuals with overweight or obesity, and at least 1 child aged 5-10 years of age, to
participate in a 6-month randomized trial with a wait-list cross-over design. Based on the weekly menu plan, a
grocery list will be generated, and items delivered to the home. Anthropometric measurements, blood pressure,
dietary intake and blood samples for HbA1c, liver enzymes and lipids will be collected at baseline, 6, and 12
months. Each family will be expected to contribute $100/week, with the amount above this subsidized as an
incentive for participation. Specific aims are: 1) Develop an affordable and culturally sensitive meal-planning and
grocery delivery intervention for Latino households. 2) Determine the impact of food prescriptions and grocery
delivery on parental obesity, diet quality and chronic disease risk. 3) Determine the impact of food prescriptions
and grocery delivery on child obesity, diet quality and chronic disease risk. In a cross-center aim, data from this
Project will be combined with Projects 1 and 2 to examine: 1) The multi-level determinants of chronic disease
risk in Latino children; and 2) The effects of different types of family-based interventions and how social and
environmental factors affect the response to intervention. If this approach proves effective, food prescriptions
could provide a scalable and sustainable model to improve diet, health, and well-being in Latino families."
10884469,"PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORE ABSTRACT
The University of Virginia (UVA), Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and Virginia Tech (VT), each have
well developed Professional Development programs for pre- and post-doctoral trainees participating in basic or
translational biomedical research. However, educational opportunities in KUH generally are sparse. This
proposal addresses this deficiency. We plan to take advantage of the particular strengths of each institution and
the revolution in web-based conferencing in response to the pandemic to help create an effective multi-
institutional training program. The majority of classes and seminars offered to our trainees will be both in person
and on-line, so that the institutional strengths can be shared by all. Hence, the inclusion of three primary
institutions as well as other participants serves as a strength, rather than a weakness of the training program.
An advantage of the heavy emphasis on web-based conferencing is that it will familiarize trainees with the
technologies that are the wave of the future in science and medicine. Another point of emphasis in our
professional development plan is intellectual property education. Aim 1: To teach trainees skills that enable
them to tackle all aspects of career development. These include effective written and oral presentations;
enhancing overall communication skills; and developing an effective professional network. Trainees will be
immersed in a team science approach to aid in networking and exposure to cutting-edge technologies including
on-line communication. Aim 2: To provide trainees with mentoring skills and to improve the mentoring
skills of preceptors. Mentoring will include formal didactic training and informal basic and clinical research
training. The program will avail preceptors with teaching forums and trainee evaluations in order to improve
mentoring."

The Commonwealth of Virginia is home to major research institutions including University of Virginia (UVA),
Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) that have
with well-funded and developed research programs. One of the major goals of the Integrated Virginia Research
Training Centers in Kidney, Urology and Hematology (IGNITE KUH) is to strengthen the collaboration between
these institutions, particularly in integrating research in benign KUH fields. The program is a novel effort to create
a research hub to not only train predoctoral and postdoctoral scientists, but also showcase the significance of
KUH research careers to the next generation of scientists. Through the networking core, we will develop a
statewide program by providing a platform for peer-to-peer mentorship and performing outreach activities to
attract students from the three constituent institutions, and also act as a concierge to foster interactions with
students from under-represented and minority institutions in Virginia who are interested in KUH research. There
are several undergraduate research programs at UVA, VCU, VT as well as at the historically black colleges and
universities (HBCU), however there is no central nexus, in particular for research of the KUH-related diseases
that pose a major disease burden for the minority and rural population of Virginia. The networking core of the
IGNITE KUH will act as a liaison between the program trainees and mentors with the students and faculty of
these undergraduate research programs in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The networking core of the IGNITE
KUH has the following specific aims: (1) To provide career guidance for KUH research at multiple training levels;
(2) To provide a platform for dissemination of scientific ideas and progress of KUH research; and (3) To increase
the visibility of KUH research in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The activities will include direct peer-to-peer
mentoring, networking with undergraduate programs, long-term near-peer partnerships, and integration with
national programs. The outreach activities include symposiums, webpages/virtual newsletter, and an information
portal for matching interested students with the appropriate programs in UVA, VCU and VT in partnership with
iTHRIV and Healthy Appalachia Institute initiatives of the Commonwealth of Virginia."

is to develop systems and processes that support direct peer communication and near-peer mentoring amongst
all trainees supported directly by the TL1 component of this award, and including those institutional trainees
already supported by other NIH training mechanisms, such as Fellowships (Fs), Career Development Awards
(Ks), Short-term Training Grants (T35s), Education Program Grants (R25s), and KUH-TN TL1 alumni. This
application proposes an innovative training plan and aims to build a robust peer-to-peer support system and
near-peer mentoring network, nurtured by our faculty trainers' with longstanding teaching experience and
genuine enthusiasm in supporting junior research careers. Cleveland offers unique capabilities for maintaining
such robust network, due to the proximity of what is called the “Health-Tech Corridor”, which is a 3-mile
thoroughfare that houses more than 170 biomedical, healthcare, and technology companies, together with major
healthcare and 2- and 4- year education institutions. These entities include the Cleveland Clinic, University
Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, MetroHealth Medical Center, bioscience incubators, including Bioenterprise
and Cleveland Clinic Innovations, Case Western Reserve University and Cleveland State University. Thus,
Cleveland health and biomedicine institutions and companies are geographically close, and conveniently
connected by public transit.
The proposed research plan aims to create a community of practice that will link trainees, mentors and potential
program applicants, and to promote community outreach programs designed to sustain a professional network.
These goals will be achieved by three strategic approaches to peer-to-peer support and near-peer mentoring
network: 1) create a solid virtual and in-person community of practice that will ensure rapid flow of communication
and shared awareness, will foster trust in a simple and informal way, and will increase the overall shared body
of knowledge developed across the network; 2) create and maintain a near-peer pipeline from high school
through a terminal degree, by establishing outreach programs at regional high schools and undergraduate
institutions, building on the existing web of partnerships between the U2C institutions, the Cleveland Municipal
School District (CMSD), local community colleges, and other regional science and cultural centers; and 3)
develop trainees' skills as peer and near-peer mentors through cultivating their collective competence. These
activities are structured not to merely build a network of connections among the members of Cleveland KUH-TN
but rather to generate a shared domain of interest that will fuel their passion for translational research and sustain
interest in addressing the outcomes most important to people with K-, U- and H-mission diseases and those that
love them."
10897780,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE ABSTRACT
The Administrative Core (ADMIN) for the Center to Improve Chronic disease Outcomes through Multi-level
and Multi-generational approaches Unifying Novel Interventions and Training for health EquitY (The
COMMUNITY Center) is essential for meeting the Center’s mission. The ADMIN will fully leverage the
exceptional research and training resources and infrastructure of Columbia University Irving Medical Center
(CUIMC), Weill Cornell Medical Center (WCM) and Hunter College at the City University of New York (CUNY)
and the regional healthcare systems and networks of New York-Presbyterian (NYP) Hospital System and the
Physician Affiliate Group of New York (PAGNY) to conduct prevention, screening, treatment, and management
interventions to reduce health disparities in multiple chronic diseases. The Center focuses on rigorous testing of
interventions that incorporate the multiple levels of influence from individual, interpersonal, community and
societal approaches developed by interdisciplinary team science. We have designed three synergistic projects
that focus on novel interventions in the community and NYP health care systems employing the community
health worker (CHW) model for enrollment and/or retention into the studies while also connecting participants to
services based on five domains of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH; housing instability, food insecurity,
transportation problems, utility help needs and insurance enrollment). The ADMIN will oversee, manage, and
coordinate the range of administrative activities for the entire COMMUNITY Center (Aim 1). Within the ADMIN
we will also provide COMMUNITY Center members support for projects and pilots through Core faculty with
expertise in: 1) Biostatistics; 2) Implementation Science; 3) Data Harmonization and Biomedical Informatics. The
ADMIN will also monitor research progress and ensure implementation of the Center Plans through formal
feedback and ongoing evaluations and disseminate approaches, methods, findings and best practices across
our NYC Region and through the NIMHD Centers and health policy forums. In addition to evaluating the projects
and IDC pilots based on their deliverables, we will evaluate the other novel aspects of our program including the
CHW model and the CONNECTOME’S community projects. The COMMUNITY Center’s ultimate impact in
eliminating health disparities in multiple chronic diseases in our NYC Region will come from our collective efforts
in developing, translating and sustaining novel interventions and programs through community engaged
research that addresses synergies across prevention, treatment and management strategies. The projects that
we have developed and the pilots and community grants that will form the heart of this Center are the first steps
to meeting this goal. The ADMIN will support this mission."

non-white, 1/3 foreign-born, and 1/5 living below the Federal poverty line. As the central hub of the networks
throughout the New York City region, we have aptly named the core, the CONNECTOME. The goals of
community engagement—to build trust, foster bi-directional communication, create equitable systems and
policies that promote and sustain economic, physical, mental and social health—define health equity for
communities. While the commitment to community engagement is reflected in a number of major federal
initiatives, we have yet to realize its full potential in addressing multiple chronic health conditions in an
increasingly diverse United States population. Key reasons for the lack of realization of the full potential is that
much research, care, and community outreach still remain focused on single chronic disease and often at later
stages of the lifespan and frequently only at one academic institution. We are thrilled that this RFA is specifically
designed to serve communities who suffer from multiple chronic diseases and rightly challenge us to have a
more integrated approach reaching beyond the boundaries of academe and integrating across the siloed medical
model to address upstream effects. This mechanism will provide the resources to develop sustainable
interventions to improve community health across the NYC Region. The COMMUNITY Center partners CUIMC,
WCMC, Hunter/CUNY and PAGNY (see Overall). To fully tackle the health disparities that exist in the NYC
region, we must address the social determinants of health (SDOH) and broader social contexts that shape health
and disease. The COMMUNITY Center seeks to tackle the SDOH at the individual, interpersonal/community and
societal levels. The COMMUNITY Core (CONNECTOME) supports these efforts by: 1) Synergizing and
empowering a growing number New York City-based stakeholders (safety-net provider organizations,
community members, community-based organizations, foundations, non-profits, CTSA’s and researchers) using
a coalition approach to improving management of multiple chronic diseases, specifically CVD and cancer; 2)
Serving as a focal point for organizing and nurturing productive bi-directional relationships between the
COMMUNITY connectome members, core directors, investigators in the projects and pilots within and across
our communities and stakeholder groups, and 3) Disseminating the information generated by the COMMUNITY
program through the connectome to diverse audiences including our local communities, public and community
colleges, and faith and community-based organization in New York and regional and national policy leaders to
enact meaningful change. Integral to these aims are novel methods for engagement which includes community

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, the leading causes of mortality in Latinx, share many risk factors,
including cardiometabolic risk factors. Latinx have some of the highest prevalence rates for obesity and type 2
diabetes (T2D), and in New York City, one of the highest hypertension (HTN) burdens. Improving multiple
domains of cardiometabolic health (CMH) through contextual behavioral interventions can have far-reaching
effects for reducing the burden of multiple morbidities. Despite a strong evidence base supporting the role of
sleep as a major contributor to CMH, including work by our team, most lifestyle interventions have targeted diet
or physical activity and not sleep. Sleep is amenable to intervention, and can improve CMH through
complementary or synergistic biologic pathways with other lifestyle factors. Insufficient, irregular, and poor
quality sleep is widely prevalent, affecting >50% of US adults with a disproportionately higher burden in racial
and ethnic minorities, and sleep health disparities have been shown to account for a large portion of racial and
ethnic disparities in CMH. We will conduct community engagement and stakeholder participatory research to
refine and culturally adapt a multidimensional sleep health (MDSH) intervention for Latinx adults (Aim 1). Using
a parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, we will evaluate the effect of the MDSH
intervention on improving blood pressure (BP), glycemic control indicators, and anthropometric markers of
adiposity (Aim 2). We will enroll 300 midlife to older Latinx men and women at high risk for multiple chronic
diseases, identified through the New York-Presbyterian Hospital cancer screening centers, and randomize to
either a control arm that receives standard Life's Simple 7 cardiovascular health educational materials or
an intervention arm that, in addition to Life's Simple 7 materials, receives a MDSH intervention based on
evidence-based sleep hygiene education and established behavior change techniques (personalized sleep
health feedback, goal setting, self-monitoring, motivational enhancement). We will further leverage this RCT to
explore the effect of sleep on markers of systemic inflammation that are related to both CVD and cancer
risk. Finally, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and working closely with the
COMMUNITY Center Implementation Science Core, we will use mixed methods to understand implementation
determinants, processes, and outcomes, ensuring the successful completion and future expansion of this work
(Aim 3). Community health workers, with experience working with the NYC Latinx communities, will deliver the
intervention, and we will assemble a community and stakeholder collaborative panel, with support from the
COMMUNITY CONNECTOME, that will actively participate in all aspects of the aims. Findings will inform the
development and implementation of scalable and sustainable personalized population health approaches for
addressing sleep health disparities to improve the effectiveness, implementation, and reach of interventions
aimed at reducing multiple chronic diseases and extending healthspan."
10877064,"Abstract
 Exosomes are extracellular vesicles secreted by many types of cells and play important roles in mediating
intercellular communications. Endogenous exosomes have been emerging as a new and attractive class of
therapeutics, owing to their unique and important characteristics. However, effective approaches remain limited
for targeting exosomes to desired cells and tissues. And few methods are available for active loading of protein
cargos into exosomes for cellular delivery. To address these challenges for broadening therapeutic utility of
exosomes and unleashing their full potential, we propose to develop an innovative platform technology, termed
synthetic multivalent antibodies retargeted exosomes (SMART-Exos). This will be achieved through genetically
and chemically engineering exosomes with functional antibodies, ligands, and enzymes, combined with
encapsulation of different types of therapeutic payloads. By integrating knowledge and technologies in exosome
biology, protein engineering, synthetic chemistry, and enzyme inhibitor design, we aim to design and generate
a series of SMART-Exos with new and/or enhanced functions and properties through distinct but complementary
strategies. The resulting SMART-Exos are expected to redirect exosomes toward target cells in high specificity
for modulating cellular functions and processes through receptor engagement and/or cargo delivery, leading to
the development of a general and versatile platform technology for next-generation investigational and
therapeutic exosomes."
10843251,"Project Summary/Abstract
In the past decade, the scientific community has witnessed accelerated genetic discoveries for
neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders (NPD) such as schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), bipolar disorder, and major depression. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-exome
sequencing (WES) have identified a mounting number of NPD risk genes. However, translating these exciting
genetic discoveries into clinically actionable biology has been impeded by our limited knowledge of gene function
and related disease mechanisms. A bottleneck in the field is that most biological characterization has focused
on very few NPD genes, which have not necessarily been selected for study based on pathophysiological
importance. Furthermore, genes are often studied one at a time, hindering the pace of our understanding of
disease mechanisms. We propose an alternative strategy: large-scale, unbiased, parallel study of NPD genes
in disease-relevant model systems, in response to the RFA-MH-22-111 (Scalable and Systematic Neurobiology
of Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Disorder Risk Genes-SSPsyGene). We propose to establish the Assay
and Data Generation Center (ADGC) for the Model of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived Neurons for
NPD (MiNND), where we will implement and optimize novel scalable and systematic assays for interrogating the
molecular and neurobiological functions of up to 200 NPD risk genes. Teaming up with the SSPsyGene
Consortium and leveraging our team’s respective expertise in stem cell biology, functional genomics,
neuroscience, and functional analysis, our MiNND-ADGC will generate loss-of-function (LoF) iPSC human neural
models, and perform high-content morphometric and single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) analyses of NPD
LoF alleles. We will also assay synaptic functions using optical sensors in a high-throughput fashion and carry
out multimodal PatchSeq analyses and modeling to predict neuronal properties from scRNA-seq data. Finally,
working with the SSPsyGene Consortium, we will conduct data integration, curation, and dissemination to the
research community and public for further analysis. Our MiNND-ADGC will build a valuable resource and
integrated knowledge base that will provide a fertile foundation for future studies of disease mechanisms. The
data from studying the selected NPD risk genes on multiple genetic backgrounds, including the understudied
African American iPSC lines, will enable robust inferences of potential cross-disorder and cross-population
biological convergence and divergence relevant to NPD."

 Improved understanding of the neurobiological systems involved in excessive caloric consumption is
critical for developing novel prevention and treatment strategies for obesity. Traditionally the field has focused
on hypothalamic and brainstem substrates that control `homeostatic' food intake that occurs in response to
energy deficits. In addition to studying these classic feeding centers, it is critical to also identify the systems
through which higher-order brain regions regulate reward-driven food seeking and consumption based on
learned, incentive, and hedonic cognitive factors. This project investigates the hippocampus (HPC) as a critical
brain substrate integrating memory processes and feeding-related signals to regulate conditioned food-
motivated behavior, including appetitive responses linked with excessive caloric intake and obesity. Our focus
is on two HPC subregions that intersect feeding behavior and memory: the ventral HPC CA1 (CA1v) and the
dorsal CA3 (CA3d). Our findings from the previous funding cycle identify a role for CA1v projections targeting
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), and lateral septum (LS) as pathways
functionally relevant to feeding behavior 1-3. Aim 1 experiments will advance these findings to identify the role
of three HPC projection pathways (CA1v -> mPFC, LHA, LS) in HPC-dependent associative learning tasks
that are relevant to excessive caloric intake and are based on categorically separate food-associated stimuli,
including [1] interoceptive energy status cues, [2] external contextual cues, and [3] social-based olfactory cues.
 In addition to the appetitive associative memory processes described above, HPC-dependent meal-
related episodic memory (recalling who, what, when, and where surrounding a meal) powerfully influences
feeding behavior 4-8. Results from the previous funding cycle identified a neural pathway through which
gastrointestinal (GI) vagus afferent nerve (VAN) signaling, traditionally studied in the context of meal size
control, promotes HPC-dependent memory 9. Our preliminary results support the hypotheses that [1] the
stomach-derived hormone ghrelin acts via GI VAN signaling to promote meal-related episodic memory, and
[2] medial septum (MS) cholinergic signaling is a relay connecting GI VAN signaling and HPC function.
These hypotheses are investigated in Aim 2 experiments using an innovative combination of state-of-the-art
methodologies, including in vivo fiber photometry-based imaging of novel fluorescent genetically-encoded
sensors for acetylcholine (ACh) 10,11 and stomach distention-dependent electrical VAN stimulation. The extent
to which these ventral and dorsal HPC pathways converge through shared collateral projections, and/or
common downstream targets is examined in Aim 3 experiments that utilize neural pathway tracing approaches
to [1] map the collateral and 2nd-order projections of CA1v projections to mPFC, LHA, and LS, and [2] identify
downstream projections of CA3d neurons that encode GI VAN signaling. Overall results from these three
interconnected aims will identify novel neural systems that intersect memory and feeding behavior."
10877918,"Computational approaches based on statistical, mathematical and machine-learning principles are now
permeating all areas of biological and biomedical research. Driving this explosion in biological computation are
new high-throughput techniques in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and chemoinformatics, and advances

analyze and interpret. Also driving the use of computing in biomedical research is the increasing availability of
high-performance computing, including graphical processing units (GPUs), that make deep learning and other
artificial intelligence approaches computationally feasible. As a result, there is an increasing demand for
biomedical researchers with expertise in scientific computing and data analytics and trained in statistical and
mathematical modeling. To address this need, in 2007 the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill established
the Ph.D. Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB).
 The mission of the BCB curriculum is to train the next generation of scientists with the computational and
quantitative skills required to make important contributions to modern biological and biomedical research. To
accomplish this goal, not only requires students receive training in computational, mathematical and statistical
approaches, but also that they become sufficiently versed in biology and acquire skills required for
multidisciplinary team science. The BCB curriculum also strives to provide students with the professional skills
required to successfully transition into careers in the biomedical workforce. The specific objects of the BCB
curriculum are to: 1) provide broad knowledge of bioinformatics and computational biology approaches and the
computational, statistical and mathematical foundations on which they are built, 2) provide in depth training in a
chosen area of bioinformatics and computational biology, 3) train students to participate in collaborative and
interdisciplinary research, 4) train students to develop independent research programs and identify new research
directions, 5) develop skills in oral and written communication, 6) provide students with professional training
opportunities for careers outside of academics and 7) provide students with training in the Responsible Conduct
of Research, and in Rigor and Reproducibility.
 The proposed T32 training program will support 6 BCB students during their second year of graduate
training. In addition to providing didactic training and scientific research opportunities, the BCB curriculum
provides professional training opportunities by sponsoring events such as “lunch and learn” sessions with
representatives from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and “hackathons” with the National Center
for Biotechnology Information. The University of North Carolina and BCB curriculum are committed to providing
a supportive environment for students from all backgrounds and providing them with the training needed to
successfully transitions to biomedical research careers in academic, governmental and corporate settings."
10894627,"Project Summary
A substantial portion of patients with liver disease, ranging from 5% to 30%, have unknown causes beyond
the established etiologies. Unknown etiology is observed across a wide array of clinical phenotypes in liver
disease, such as acute liver failure (ALF), hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. These are collectively referred
to as cryptogenic liver disease (CLD). It has long been hypothesized there exist additional human viruses that
cause CLD. In our recent serum virome study, we identified a 387-nt DNA fragment (GenBank MW468091),
named Seq260, from 1 of 9 CLD patients. In a series of experiments of gene-walking, enzymatic digestion,
and rolling circle amplification and analyses, we have demonstrated that Seq260 is a linear single-stranded
DNA. We screened Seq260 in 409 subjects, including healthy blood donors (n=200), hepatitis C virus infection
(n=100), Acute liver failure (ALF) patients with indeterminate etiology (n=50), and liver transplantation (LT)
patients with (n=45) and without known etiology (n=14). Seq260 was detected in 5 CLD patients (1 ALF and
4 LT) and 1 LT patient with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-associated cirrhosis. One patient had Seq260
quantifiable in liver, showing a titer in the liver 7.74 times higher than that in serum (2.4x106 copies/g vs.
3.1x105 copies/mL). Machine learning analysis reached a high score (likelihood) of Seq260 being a eukaryotic
viral sequence. Aggregately, these data lead to our hypothesis that Seq260 represents an unrecognized
human virus with liver tropism. To determine if Seq260 represents a novel hepatitis virus, we bring about a
research plan in the current proposal that consists of three major experiments. First, we will screen Seq260
in CLD patients as well as the controls. We have been granted access to patient specimens from two NIH-
sponsored clinical trials, ALF study group (ALFSG), and the adult-to-adult living donor liver transplantation
cohort study (A2ALL). Unknown etiology accounted for 5.5% and 29.5% respectively in the ALFSG and
A2ALL. Seq260 copy numbers will be quantitated in both serum and liver in Seq260-positive patients with
liver tissue available. Second, we will determine the full genome of the putative virus containing Seq260.
Finally, we will evaluate antibody responses in virus-positive patients and the controls. A peptide-based
serological test will be developed for the putative virus. Peptides will be individually assessed for their
specificity and sensitivity in two virus-positive patients with large volumes of serum available. Selected
peptides will then be combined to ELISA tests for the measurement of antibody (IgG and IgM) responses in
virus-positive and virus-negative patients. Taken together, the proposed study will characterize a novel human
virus and understand its etiological link to liver disease from a clinical aspect. It will expand our knowledge of
the human virome as well as the etiology of liver disease without a known cause."
10813886,"Title: Dormancy-dependent determination of hematopoietic stem cell fate from hemogenic endothelium
Project Summary/Abstract:
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), uniquely defined by their simultaneous capacity for multilineage blood cell
formation and life-long self-renewal, represent a valuable resource for both the treatment and study of blood
and immune disorders. Methods to generate HSCs de novo, such as from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), are of
great interest, as they could significantly enhance availability of HSCs for research and therapeutic purposes.
However, reproducible protocols to produce functional HSCs from PSCs have been largely elusive. This likely
reflects our incomplete understanding of the molecular programs required for HSC specification during
embryonic development. The primary objective of this project is to address this critical barrier by identifying the
unique factors necessary to impart HSC fate from the embryonic precursors to hematopoiesis, hemogenic
endothelium (HE). Toward this goal, we will leverage an innovative ex vivo vascular niche platform that
supports the development of murine embryonic HSCs, combined with integrated single cell techniques, to
uncover the distinctive molecular properties of HE that can acquire functional HSC fate in vitro. In initial studies
using this approach, we determined that HSC-competent HE possess a transcriptional signature uniquely
characterized by relative metabolic and mitotic dormancy associated with decreased MYC target gene activity.
We further determined that HSC emergence in vitro is dependent on niche-derived chemokine, CXCL12, and
that its receptor, CXCR4, is expressed on HSC-competent HE. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that
the dormant state of HSC-competent HE functions to delay hematopoietic differentiation and establish self-
renewal programs essential for HSC specification, which will be tested in Aim 1. We further hypothesize that
CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling reinforces dormancy and self-renewal programs in HE, supporting their transition to
functional HSCs in the vascular niche, which will be tested in Aim 2. Our broader objective is to determine
whether modulation of signal pathways promoting dormancy during HE specification from murine and human
PSCs can enhance functional HSC development in vitro, which will be pursued in Aim 3. Success in these
studies would provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms orchestrating HSC genesis and facilitate
progress toward the long-term goal of de novo generation of HSCs from PSCs for therapeutic applications."

Doxorubicin (Dox), an anthracycline chemotherapeutic, is a well-established and highly effective chemotherapy
drug commonly used to treat multiple cancer types, but its use is limited by cardiotoxicity. Patients with Dox
therapy often develop delayed cardiomyopathy for which no effective therapies exist. The molecular
mechanisms of this drug toxicity remain poorly understood and are likely to be multifactorial. DNA damage,
mitochondrial dysfunction, p53 activation, and excessive cardiomyocyte apoptosis are major contributors to the
pathogenesis of Dox-induced cardiac toxicity, but whether a pharmacological strategy can simultaneously work
to reverse all of these events in patients that receive Dox treatment has yet to be uncovered. Our laboratories
have a long track record in studying the role of nuclear receptor 4A (NR4A) biology in cardiovascular
homeostasis and disease. In recent work, we have generated a significant body of evidence to support the
novel concept that reduced cardiac expression of Nur77, a family member of NR4A receptors, plays a causal
role in the pathogenesis of Dox cardiomyopathy. We have found that 1) Cardiac expression of Nur77 is
significantly reduced in Dox treated cardiomyocytes and hearts and that 2) Cardiac specific overexpression of
Nur77 effectively prevents Dox induced cardiac dysfunction, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and fibrosis. In addition,
we have identified DNA topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) as a key downstream effector of Nur77
in the heart, and have found that its expression is substantially reduced in Dox-treated hearts. More importantly,
our preliminary data indicate that Nur77 prevents cardiac toxicity by inducing TopBP1-topoisomerase IIβ
(Top2β) interactions, which in turn effectively shields Top2β/genomic DNA from Dox-induced damage in the
heart. These data led us to hypothesize that Nur77 serves as an important cardioprotective agent and that
targeted activation of Nur77 can effectively prevent Dox-induced cardiomyopathy while having minimal to no
effects on its anti-cancer behaviors. We will test this hypothesis in the following three aims. Aim 1 will perform
loss-of-function studies by employing Nur77 cardiac specific knockout mice (cNur77-KO) to determine whether
cardiac specific deletion of Nur77 exacerbates Dox-induced cardiotoxicity through enhanced apoptosis, fibrosis,
and inflammation in the heart. Aim 2 will determine the underlying mechanisms by which Nur77 exhibits its
cardioprotective effects against Dox-induced cardiac injury. Cardiac specific TopBP1 transgenic and knockout
mice will be used to assess the contribution of TopBP1 to the Nur77-initiated cardiac protection in mouse
models of Dox cardiotoxicity. Aim 3 will study whether pharmacological activation of Nur77 holds the capacity
to block Dox cardiomyopathy without compromising anti-cancer activity of the drug. Successful completion of
these aims will guide us to develop new therapeutic agents to prevent selective toxicity of anticancer drugs to
the heart. The predicted utility and feasibility of such targeting in humans favors the translational potential and
ultimate impact of the proposed studies."

 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder with several neurological and developmental
complications. Young children with SCD between 2 and 5 years of age, in particular, have an increased risk for
ischemic stroke and silent cerebral infarctions (SCI). SCI are hyperintense T2 brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) lesions with no accompanying acute neurological symptoms but with associated impaired
cognition and increased risk of future progressive or additional stroke/SCI. Neuroimaging and neurocognitive
profiles associated with SCI are well established in school-aged and adult SCD populations. This information is
largely unknown in young children under 6 years of age with SCD due to risk of sedation/anesthesia with MRI.
Our preliminary studies have shown that behavioral training can yield high quality neuroimaging data without
sedation in 3 to 4 years old children with SCD through a pilot study.
 The long term goal of this application is to develop a diagnostic battery using a combination of
unsedated neuroimaging measures, neurocognitive testing, and plasma brain injury protein levels to identify
young children with SCD at risk for SCI. Through a prospective longitudinal case-control study, we will collect
medical history and clinical data and perform neurological examination and blood draws annually in 100
children with SCD from study entry to study exit. Participants will also undergo initial neuroimaging battery at 3
to 4 years of age with repeat neuroimaging at study exit as well as longitudinal neurocognitive testing at study
entry, with initial neuroimaging, and with exit neuroimaging. This multi-disciplinary and multi-modality proposal
has two Aims. Aim 1 will identify the cross-sectional neuroimaging and neurocognitive findings in 3 to 4 year-
old children with SCD and SCI on initial MRI by comparing their results to children with SCD without SCI. Aim
2 will compare longitudinal data from 6 year-old children with and without SCI on exit MRI. Exploratory aims
will explore differences in the neuroimaging measures in children on different disease-modifying treatments
(hydroxyurea) and plasma protein levels in children with and without SCI. The proposed work will determine
which neuroimaging measures and neurocognitive testing may predict SCI, leading to a multi-site study to
validate these findings in a larger regionally heterogenous SCD population. The study PI, a
neurodevelopmental physician, is an early stage investigator well suited to expand her existing study cohort
with support from a team of co-investigators, including a senior behavioral psychologist and neuroimaging

and genes associated with blood lipid levels using new methods, diverse cohorts, and clinical trials to identify
new therapeutic targets and risk mitigation frameworks for lipids and cardiovascular disease. Our research
team combines strengths in cardiovascular medicine, statistical genetics, high-throughput genetics and
genomics, and development and application of innovative computational and statistical methods. In Aim 1, we
will determine genetic variants associated with lipid levels leveraging over 2.5 million multi-ethnic samples. In
Aim 2, we will perform phenome-wide scans for lipid-associated alleles and bi-directional multi-phenotype
Mendelian randomization in ~1 million individuals. In Aim 3, we will build and evaluate multi-ethic polygenic risk
scores for lipid levels in epidemiologic studies and completed clinical trials. In Aim 4 we will create a web-
based compute engine to both provide our association results and calculate individual-level polygenic risk
scores to facilitate the standardization of scores across studies. This proposal is a renewal of the previous
Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC) award and established collaborative relationships, and will allow
for the continued effort and coordination of the consortium. Completion of our aims will provide new insights
that have the potential to catalyze breakthroughs in prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of cardiovascular
disease and may serve as a model for other large-scale genetic studies."

Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) is a dominantly inherited, degenerative disease of the macula that is
characterized by bilateral loss of central vision as a consequence of RPE dystrophy and choroidal
neovascularization (CNV). Specific mutations in the TIMP-3 gene involving exon 5 or the intron4-exon5
boundary have been shown to be causative. The age-related macular degeneration (AMD) consortium has
identified rare coding variants in the TIMP3 gene when analyzing 16,144 patients and 17,832 controls. The
clinical and histopathological similarities between AMD and SFD and the identification of variants in the
matrix metalloproteinase pathway in AMD suggest that similar downstream effectors might be in play in both
conditions. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the CNV in SFD will
provide information that could be potentially useful in AMD. In comparative studies using TIMP-3 deficient
mice, S179CTIMP-3 transgenic mice and in vitro culture experiments we have determined that RPE cells
expressing mutant TIMP3 undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and have altered
metabolism. These changes are correlated with increased bFGF and hyaluronan deposition. Based on these
results, we hypothesize that under physiological conditions, TIMP3 is required to control and localize matrix
degradation in the RPE/choroid which keeps the RPE in an epithelial state and allows for normal metabolic
activity. Loss of TIMP3 function in this regard leads to EMT and altered metabolism which could have
significant effects on RPE and retinal health."
10863956,"The liver is a frequent site of metastasis for several cancers and when this occurs, it is associated with poor
response to immunotherapy. Liver-directed radiotherapy (RT) is a non-traditional immune modulating therapy
that improves immune checkpoint blockade (ICB, αPD-1 or αPD-1/αCTLA-4) mediated control of liver metastasis
and non-irradiated abscopal tumors. Unfortunately, enhanced tumor control following liver-directed radiotherapy
and ICB is often short-lived for irradiated tumors and unpredictable for non-irradiated tumors. Thus, novel
immunotherapeutic approaches that can stimulate antitumor immunity in the liver have the potential to boost
liver-directed RT plus ICB mediated control of irradiated and non-irradiated abscopal tumors. Toward this goal,
we are harnessing the ability of the toll-like receptor (TLR) 5 pathway to signal in the liver more so than other
sites. Hepatocytes sense Salmonella flagellin and our derivative called entolimod through cell surface TLR5 and
cytoplasmic NAIP5 inflammasome. Importantly, systemically administered entolimod was shown to be safe in
rodents, non-human primates, and Phase I safety trials in healthy volunteers and cancer patients cumulatively
involving nearly 200 subjects. Our prior work showed that entolimod protects normal tissues but not tumors from
radiation toxicities and stimulates CD8+ T cell dependent antitumor immunity against preclinical models of liver
metastasis. Here, we showed that entolimod enhances liver-directed RT in pre-clinical models mirroring
advanced liver metastasis and that this occurs via a poorly resolved Nφ dependent mechanism. The outstanding
questions that this proposal seeks to address are: 1) what is the impact of entolimod on liver-directed RT plus
ICB mediated control of liver metastasis and abscopal tumors?; 2) how does the TLR5-NAIP5 pathway in Nφ
support antitumor immunity post liver-directed RT and ICB?; and 3) what is the translational relevance of the
TLR5-NAIP5 pathway plus RT in human tumors and Nφ? Our central hypothesis is that entolimod enhances
liver-directed RT plus ICB via Nφ-dependent release of IFN-γ, a cytokine that can be released by activated Nφ
to support antitumor immunity. To test our central hypothesis, we propose three interactive aims: 1) To unveil
the impact of entolimod on liver-directed RT plus ICB mediated control of liver metastasis and abscopal tumors;
2) To elucidate the mechanism by which the TLR5-NAIP5 pathway in Nφ triggers antitumor immunity post liver-
directed RT and ICB; and 3) To determine the translational relevance of the TLR5-NAIP5 pathway plus RT in
fresh human colorectal cancer and melanoma samples and patient-matched Nφ. The impact of this work lies in
the fact that all components of this therapy are in the clinic for cancer patients thereby ensuring the feasibility to
combine these components into a novel and innovative therapy to improve the dire survival outcomes associated
with liver metastasis."
10860940,"ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is diagnosed at advanced stages in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
The lack of knowledge of CRC signs and symptoms by patients and community health practitioners frequently
leads to delayed presentation with Stage 3-4 disease. This initial delay, paired with limited colonoscopy facilities,
leads to prolonged diagnostic delays. The result is a 5-year mortality rate in LMIC up to 5 times higher than that
in USA. An innovative solution to this problem could be an affordable, easily deployable, “point of care” molecular
test to identify and prioritize patients likely to have a malignancy for expedited colonoscopy and pathology review
leading to better outcomes. Continuing our established collaboration with our industrial partner, Cepheid, we
propose to build on our strong published data on hypermethylated markers in CRC to develop an affordable, <3-
hour, automated CRC-methylation detection blood test that analyzes a panel of five hypermethylated genes in
cell free DNA from 1 ml of plasma. The proposed innovations could lead to a single-cartridge assay for quick
CRC detection with a 3-fold reduction in cost. In Aim 1a, we will optimize a cartridge-less bisulfite DNA
conversion method for plasma and test its efficiency in Patient Set 1 plasma (N= 20 malignant, 20 normal). In
Aim 1b we will select one optimal 5-marker panel out of 20 CRC markers using DNA from FFPE samples from
the U.S and Nigeria (N= 30 malignant, 30 benign), and one optimal “pan” set will be confirmed in plasma using
U.S Patient Set 2 and Nigeria Set 3 (N=35 malignant, 35 benign). In Aim 1c, we will evaluate analytical
performance of the CRC-MD assay. Intra-assay reproducibility will be assessed on multiple aliquots of U.S
Patient Set 4 plasma (N=35 malignant, 35 benign). Inter-operator reproducibility will be determined using
replicate aliquots of plasma from Patient Set 4 (N= 35 malignant, 35 benign). The goal of Aim 2a is to technically
validate the CRC-MD assay using prospectively collected samples in Nigeria. We will first select a threshold in
a Training set of plasma from Patient Set 4 (N=90 malignant, 90 benign) to optimally balance sensitivity and
specificity, and validate performance of the selected threshold in a Test set of plasma from Patient Set 5 (N= 90
malignant, 90 benign). Accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, and positive- and negative-predictive value) of CRC-
MD-based diagnosis to distinguish benign versus malignant disease will be measured using histopathological
diagnosis of the lesion as the gold standard. Lastly, in Aim 2b, to determine whether the performance of the
CRC-MD assay is altered by select patient characteristics, we will test its clinical accuracy among specific patient
subgroups classified by age, sex, BMI, and tumor characteristics. Our prior success in developing automated
cell-based/liquid biopsy assays with Cepheid has established the path ensuring an accurate and reliable test.
This intervention could be cost saving by hastening colonoscopy for those who need it urgently, thus expediting
detection and treatment of CRC in LMICs. This will save thousands of lives yearly. This study will also facilitate
further development of the CRC-MD assay moving toward future commercialization and access globally."

Our overarching goal is to enable the AI-empowered 3D histopathological interpretation on routine digitized renal
tissue biopsies, so as to (1) allow renal pathologists to perform a reproducible 3D phenotyping on serial 2D whole
slide images (WSI), (2) advance the characterization of kidney-allograft rejection phenotypes on kidney
transplant patients with cutting-edge 3D computer vision, and (3) equip clinical scientists with an advanced 3D
spatial transcriptomics analytics tool to investigate the anatomical-molecular associated causes of chronic kidney
disease (CKD). Our novel 3D histopathological interpretation, with 3D computer vision (Map3D toolkit) and
3D spatial transcriptomics, will open a new door for performing reproducible clinical phenotyping (Pheno3D
toolkit), identifying and validating new 3D imaging and molecular biomarkers (GPS3D toolkit), and ultimately
advancing the patient care with personalized diagnosis and prognosis options for a wide range of CKD.
Despite more than 25 years of exploitation of digital pathology, the presence, significance and
characteristics of 3D contextual information in renal histopathological assessment have been largely
overlooked. The current 2D interpretation on renal histopathology is error-prone and less reproducible due to
the heterogeneity of tissue morphologies (e.g., glomeruli, tubules, vessels) across 3D serial sections. For
example, our previous study on segmental glomerulosclerosis (GS) in patients with nephrotic syndrome and
idiopathic FSGS, the percent of GS increased from 31.5 +/- 6.8% to 48.0 +/- 6.6% (P < 0.025) in adults by
replacing a 2D single section analysis with 3D serial section analysis. Moreover, 2D based phenotyping can also
hinder the discovery of new biomarkers via state-of-the-art spatial transcriptomic techniques. As an example, a
glomerulus with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can have a normal appearance on a specific 2D
section, which might lead to an opposite molecular finding using 2D spatial transcriptomics
The core tenant of this proposal is NOT developing a new 3D imaging modality, but rather, to develop
technologies that enable reproducible 3D characterization on routine 2D renal histopathological biopsies (with
trivial added cost), so as to advance the care of future patients with renal diseases. To this end, we will:
Aim 1. Develop novel 3D computer vision tools (Map3D) to facilitate renal pathologists in modeling,
quantifying, and visualizing 3D renal histopathological tissues from routine 2D digital histopathology.
Impact: Allow renal pathologists to perform a reproducible 3D phenotyping on serial 2D whole slide images (WSI).
Aim 2. Develop 3D phenotyping tools (Pheno3D) to advance the characterization of kidney-allograft
rejection for kidney transplant patients via 3D computer vision and self-supervised deep learning.
Impact: Advance the characterization of kidney-allograft rejection phenotypes for kidney transplant patients.
Aim 3. Develop 3D computer vision algorithms for 2D and 3D spatial transcriptomics (GPS3D toolkit).
Impact: Equip clinical scientists an 3D spatial transcriptomics analytics tool to investigate image-omics interaction."
10811662,"Activation of caspase-1 and caspase-11 in the context of inflammasomes leads to processing and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 and triggers a lytic cell death termed pyroptosis. Inflammasome activation and pyroptosis have been shown to protect the host from infection with a range of pathogens including Burkholderia pseudomallei, a gram-negative bacterium used as a mouse model of melioidosis. However, it is also becoming clear that inflammasome activation and pyroptosis can be deleterious to the host by triggering lethal eicosanoid storm, mediating lethal endotoxic shock, and causing disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We have recently shown that the only functional inflammasome expressed by epithelial and endothelial cells is caspase-11, and that in a model of melioidosis caspase-11-dependent pyroptosis of lung epithelial cells is protective. Based on our preliminary results and the published literature we hypothesize that activation of caspase-11 in epithelial cells will protect the host from pneumonic melioidosis through induction of pyroptosis and preferential production of anti-inflammatory eicosanoids like prostaglandin E2. In contrast, caspase-11 activation in endothelial cells may prove deleterious because it may damage barrier integrity, induce DIC and excessive inflammation through release of Tissue Factor and LTB4. Thus, studying the function of caspase-11 selectively in epithelial or endothelial cells will allow us to identify the deleterious and the beneficial responses and therefore potentially indicate therapeutic avenues to inhibit the former and encourage the latter. In aim 1 we will focus on the role of caspase-11 in epithelial cells. We will test the role of caspase-11 and gasdermin D in the production of eicosanoids by lung epithelial cells. We will also test the susceptibility to melioidosis of mice that lack expression of caspase-11 in lung epithelial cells and determine the role of epithelial-derived eicosanoids in melioidosis. In aim 2 we will study the role of caspase-11 in endothelial cells. We will examine how caspase-11 controls production of eicosanoids and release of Tissue Factor in endothelial cells. We will test the susceptibility to melioidosis of mice that lack expression of caspase-11 in endothelial cells and establish the role of Tissue Factor, Platelet Activating Factor, and DIC in the pathogenesis of melioidosis."

NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease affecting 10-30% of the general population. Its
transition from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) poses a serious health
threat due to the eventual progression to cirrhosis and liver failure. Given the fact that liver
transplant is the only treatment option for patients at the end stage of NASH, there is an urgent
need to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of NASH. So far,
both human and animal studies have suggested that chronic suppression of FAO in the liver
could be a critical driver in promoting fatty liver disease. Meanwhile, uncontrolled activation of
hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) has been identified as the primary source of hepatic fibrogenesis.
However, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding whether and how dysregulation of
hepatic fatty acid oxidation promotes NASH. Moreover, whether and how hepatic lipid regulators
contribute to HSCs activation and liver fibrosis remains unknown. We have gathered evidence
hepatic ChREBPα as a novel regulator of fatty acid oxidation in contrast to its canonical role as
lipogenic transcriptional factor. Hepatocyte-specific ChREBPα knockout mice are more sensitive
to diet induced NASH, whereas hepatic over-expression of ChREBPα protects mice against
diet-induced NASH. Our RNA-seq analysis revealed that hepatic deficiency of Chrebpα elevates
a panel of pro-fibrogenic factors in the mouse liver after feeding with NASH diet. Our in vitro
experiments further demonstrated that Chrebpα-deficient hepatocytes stimulate fibrogenesis of
human hepatic stellate cells via secreting factors, suggesting that hepatocyte ChREBPα could
influence the microenvironment around hepatic stellate cells and modulate their activities.
Based on these intriguing observations, we hypothesize that hepatocyte ChREBPα protects
against diet-induced NAFLD/NASH by promoting fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes and
suppressing hepatic stellate cells activation. In this study, we propose to test our hypothesis in
three aims: Aim 1 is to examine whether hepatic Chrebpα protects against diet-induced
NAFLD/NASH via maintaining fatty acid oxidation pathway. Aim 2 is to determine whether
hepatocyte ChREBPα suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation via secreting profibrogenic
factors. Aim 3 is to dissect out the signaling and degradation pathways that control ChREBPα
expression and activity during NASH. The completion of the proposed study would elucidate in-
depth molecular mechanisms of how ChREBPα protects against diet-induced NASH, identify
ChREBPα-associated risk factors, and shed light on novel strategies for the prevention and
treatment diet-induced NASH."

Title: Discovery and pathogenic characterization of novel monogenic causes of bladder dysfunction
 Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common cause of chronic
kidney disease in childhood. Over 40 monogenic etiologies of CAKUT have been identified, and another 150
genes have been described to cause syndromes in which urinary tract malformations are an integral
component. However, the majority of these genes coalesce into pathways that regulate upper urinary tract
development, such as metanephric mesenchyme transition and ureteric bud formation. The pathogenesis and
genetic regulation of lower urinary tract disease remain poorly understood. Recently, through the use of whole
exome sequencing, I identified mutations in the α3-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, CHRNA3, as
a novel cause of bladder dysfunction with secondary CAKUT. This is one of just eight known monogenic
causes of congenital bladder dysfunction, and, uniquely, is a gene that regulates autonomic nervous system
function. I hypothesize that additional monogenic causes of lower urinary tract disease can be identified
through the use of whole exome sequencing, and additionally, that these genes will coalesce upon
pathways that regulate urothelial signaling, detrusor contraction, and bladder innervation.
 The aims of the proposed research are twofold: (1) to apply both a candidate gene and unbiased analysis
strategy to whole exome sequencing data in order to discover novel monogenic causes of bladder dysfunction
and (2) to apply an integrated genomic approach using whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing to
an international cohort of children with CAKUT. Accomplishment of the proposed research above will provide
additional insight into the pathomechanisms that govern bladder development and function, and, ultimately,
could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for children with bladder dysfunction. In addition, validation of a
method for urinary transcriptome sequencing can help to overcome current limitations in whole exome
sequencing in the identification and interpretation of splice-altering genetic variants.
 This K08 application encompasses a comprehensive career development plan to not only ensure progress
and success in carrying out the proposed research, but also to facilitate my transition to an independent
investigator. It encompasses regular meetings with my mentor and advisory committee, research and career
development seminars, courses in genomics and transcriptomics, and participation at national and
international conferences. The research will be conducted in the rich academic environment at Boston
Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, which provides an ideal environment for further training and
career development."
10819170,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy is a common dose-limiting toxicity that can reduce therapeutic
effectiveness and impact quality of life for cancer patients. The overarching goal of this research is to
determine the molecular basis of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy to support the development of
targeted therapies to prevent and treat this toxicity. The proposed studies are based on a reverse translational
pharmacogenetic approach that uses genetic association findings to implicate critical pathways in peripheral
neuropathy. Recent genetic association and functional validation findings support a role for sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P) signaling in chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity, which are consistent with previous studies
in rodent models. The studies proposed in this application will extend these findings and address a significant
gap in our knowledge of S1P signaling in target cells for toxicity, peripheral sensory neurons. The central
hypothesis that will be tested is that modulation of S1P signaling in peripheral sensory neurons by microtubule
targeting agents plays a critical role in their neurotoxicity. A human induced pluripotent stem cell derived
sensory neuron model of chemotherapy neurotoxicity (iPS-SNs) will be employed for all studies.
Pharmacological and genetic approaches will be used to modulate S1P signaling and interrogate
chemotherapy toxicity linked to this signaling pathway. The three aims are complementary and address
discrete functions of S1P. The first aim will investigate whether microtubule targeting agents alter sphingolipid
metabolism in sensory neurons and will link specific S1P receptors to cytoskeletal changes. The studies
proposed in the second aim will focus on Rho GTPase signaling downstream of S1P receptors and will
establish the S1P signaling axis that is critical for chemotherapy-induced changes in neurite structure and the
development of retraction bulbs. The third aim will use scRNA-seq and sc-ATACseq to elucidate whether
paclitaxel-induced changes in gene expression in iPS-SNs involve S1P effects on chromatin accessibility. The
ability of fingolimod, a multiple sclerosis therapy that targets S1P receptor signaling and is currently being
tested for prevention and treatment of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, to protect against
chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity will be examined. Collectively, these studies will reveal molecular
mechanisms underlying the axon degeneration that occurs in sensory neurons in response to microtubule
targeting agents and elucidate novel mechanisms for neuroprotection with fingolimod."

 This proposal addresses a significant public health question: Does diabetes, the
3rd leading cause of death in the United States (US), impact suitability of donor corneal
tissue for transplantation? This question takes on increasing urgency as recent eye bank
data suggests donors with diabetes now comprise about 30-35% of the cornea donor
pool, a 50-72% increase in just over a decade. The impact of diabetes on keratoplasty
outcomes remains unknown, with conflicting evidence from secondary or retrospective
analyses of multiple clinical studies. Previous large clinical studies did not show a
diabetic donor effect on penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and Descemet membrane
endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) graft success, yet our recent Cornea Preservation Time
Study (CPTS) found the diabetic donor adversely affected graft outcomes following
Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Although current
standard of care is to use diabetic donor corneas for all types of keratoplasties, some
eye banks and surgeons are increasingly avoiding them for DMEK. As both the diabetic
donor population and DMEK demand increases, a definitive superiority study evaluating
effect of donor diabetes status on graft outcomes will allay and/or define these concerns.
The Diabetes Endothelial Keratoplasty Study (DEKS) will address these important
questions through a prospective masked clinical trial enrolling 1420 participant-eyes at
30 clinical sites and 15 eye banks across the US. The DEKS will determine if the 3-year
graft success rate following DMEK performed with corneas from donors without diabetes
is superior to the graft success rate with corneas from donors with diabetes. It will also
determine if the 3-year central endothelial cell loss (ECL) after DMEK with corneas from
donors without diabetes is less than the central ECL when corneas from donors with
diabetes are used. Lastly, the DEKS will explore the relationship of donor diabetes
severity, as measured by eye bank-determined diabetes risk categorization scores, post-
mortem HbA1c, and skin advanced glycation endproducts and oxidation markers, with
DMEK graft outcomes 3 years postoperatively in corneas from diabetic donors. The
DEKS could have a major impact on the targeted use of corneas from an increasing
number of donors with diabetes with a range of disease severity in a donor pool that
must continue to expand to meet the clinical demands of an aging population and DMEK
growth."

Nearly 20 million older adults undergo major elective surgical procedures, yet very few receive advance care
planning (ACP). This is a critical missed opportunity to ensure optimal and patient-aligned medical decisions and
communications. Despite ACP being incorporated into national quality metrics and society guidelines for surgical
care for older adults, there are few examples of effective integration into the pre-surgical phase. Efforts to date
have mostly focused on improving surgeons’ use of ACP but barriers remain significant, including varying levels
of familiarity and comfort to conduct ACP conversations, lack of dedicated time during the pre-surgical care
episode for these often-delicate conversations, and lack of appropriate patient-facing ACP tools to help patients
and caregivers make complex decisions about their surgical treatment. Our team has designed and tested a
theory-based, interactive ACP patient-facing technology solution (PREPARE) based on the new ACP paradigm
of preparing people for communication and medical decision-making. Despite consistent evidence that
PREPARE increases ACP engagement and patient and clinician empowerment to discuss ACP, a gap remains
in extending PREPARE’s use to pre-surgical populations. We hypothesize that by including PREPARE into the
electronic health record (HER)-centric pre-surgery workflow for older adults and including automated reminders,
we can empower patients and surgical teams to engage in ACP discussions. Given the limited time and
resources in the surgical setting to conduct ACP, we will be testing 3 delivery strategies in increasing resource
intensity (PREPARE alone, PREPARE with text/phone reminders, or the additional of a healthcare navigator).
To ensure generalizability, we will conduct our work in 3 healthcare systems (HCS): Univ. of CA, San Francisco
(UCSF), Univ. of CA, Irvine (UCI) and M Health Fairview (UMN, a collaboration among the Univ. of MN Medical
School, Univ of MN Physicians, and Fairview Health Services). We will first establish trial infrastructure (UG3) to
conduct (UH3) an NIH Stage Model III (efficacy-effectiveness) three arm RCT in 3 HCS. Patients aged 65 or
older, or with serious illness, who are referred for major elective surgery will be randomized to Arms: (1) Letter
about ACP, PREPARE advanced directive (AD), PREPARE website; (2) Letter, AD, PREPARE plus reminder
text/phone messages; (3) Letter, AD, PREPARE plus reminders plus a healthcare navigator on ACP
documentation (discussions and care plans, primary outcome) and patient-reported ACP engagement. Using
mixed methods, we will assess patients’ and surgical care teams' experience with surgery ACP. ACP note
content will be evaluated using natural language processing (NLP) and data mining to begin to identify assess
thematic completeness of ACP notes. This work is innovative because we are coalescing existing collaborations
between HCS into a transdisciplinary group of surgeons, geriatricians, and informaticians across three health
systems that will develop infrastructure and rigorously test a novel patient-centered system-level approach to
integrating ACP into the surgical care episode, the first step towards goal-concordant surgical care."
10813764,"Abstract:
This proposal, submitted in response to RFA-HS-22-001, in the priority area of “improving maternal health,” is
prompted by long-standing racial and ethnic disparities in use of permanent contraception (historically called
“surgical sterilization”). In the US, permanent contraceptive procedures are most commonly performed on
women of color, women with chronic conditions such as diabetes, and those residing in rural communities.
Although permanent contraception aligns well with some patients’ reproductive life plans, reports that 10% of
women regret having undergone these procedures are troubling. These regrets and racial disparities are
especially problematic given recent PCOR demonstrating that long-acting reversible contraceptives, such as
hormonal IUDs are both more effective and less likely to cause pelvic pain than permanent contraceptive
procedures. To disseminate PCOR about the comparative safety and real-world effectiveness of alternatives to
permanent contraception, we will adapt the advance care planning (ACP) framework, which has been used to
ensure that patients receive medical care when approaching their end of life that aligns with their personal
treatment goals. This paradigm is a critical tool for supporting patients in making complex medical decisions,
by emphasizing elicitation of values, communication skill building, and shared decision-making. By preparing
patients approaching the end of their reproductive life to more effectively communicate to clinicians their
personal values, priorities, and treatment goals, we will adapt the ACP model for reproductive life planning
(RLP), with input from patients (Aim 1, focus groups) and clinicians (Aim 2, semi-structured interviews). We will
then conduct an individual-level randomized clinical trial comparing this approach to disseminating PCOR
relevant to discussions of permanent contraception with 300 women who identify as Black or have a chronic
condition such as diabetes, and who wish to avoid future pregnancy (Aim 3). In evaluating this intervention, our
experienced multi-disciplinary team will carefully examine patient-reported outcomes related to communication
and satisfaction with care. We will also rigorously analyze heterogeneity of treatment effects by clinical and
patient-level contextual factors to inform the potential need for future refinement of this ACP-RLP paradigm. By
increasing equitable access to alternatives to permanent contraception, this project strives to increase the
proportion of US women who are using a method of contraception that aligns with their personal preferences
and reduce the proportion of individuals who regret having undergone a permanent contraceptive procedure."

increase underrepresented minorities and women scholars. Evaluation of trainees will be based on required
scholarship oversight committees, individual development plans, trainee progress reports, and compliance with
requirements for training in responsible conduct of research and reproducibility. Ongoing program evaluation
has led to improvements including the advisory committee and a new monthly “T32-Club” for trainees with
discussions of RCR, reproducibility, diversity, research-in-progress, and trainee-selected topics relevant to

The Tulane National Primate Research Center (TNPRC) has one of the largest rhesus monkey breeding colonies
in the United States. The objective of this application is to request funds for continued support and maintenance
of the U42 supported SPF Indian-origin rhesus monkey breeding colony at the TNPRC. The specific aims
address the components specified in the funding opportunity announcement (FOA) and are divided into the
Overall program description, Husbandry and Management Core, Viral Testing Core, and MHC Genetic Typing
Core. Program income and TNPRC funds will be used to support components of the program not covered by
grant funds including: per diem for any colony animals in excess of the animals supported by this application,
additional testing required for those animals, infrastructure repairs and improvements, veterinary clinical and
pathology support, behavioral management support, and portions of the genetic testing.
Specific Aims:
Overall. To maintain the existing SPF colony and distribute available animals to the NIH funded HIV/AIDS
research community.
Husbandry and Management Core. To provide husbandry and veterinary care for the SPF breeding colony
established in the existing U42 grant. This includes a robust program for clinical veterinary medical care and
behavioral management. The colony has reached a mature self-sustaining status with ideal demographics to
produce up to 105-150 animals available for assignment each year based on production and demand. Program
income generated by the animal sales will be returned to an account for use in supporting the aims of the grant.
Viral Testing Core. To assure the SPF status of the colony through continued viral testing of existing breeding
colony animals and all offspring. Continue to expand characterization of the colony beyond the required 4 viruses
to include agents such as measles virus, SARS-CoV-2, Trypanosoma cruzi, and other emerging infectious
diseases that threaten nonhuman primates.
MHC Genetic Typing Core. To continue genetic analysis and MHC typing of the colony and provide expanded
genetic characterization through enhanced techniques."
10868712,"Project Summary / Abstract
There is an 8-fold increase in the prevalence of cannabis use disorder (CUD) in individuals with bipolar disorder
(BD) relative to the general population, and individuals with co-occurring BD and CUD (BD+CUD) have
substantially worse clinical outcomes (e.g., elevated rates of suicide) than those with either BD or CUD alone.
Response to traditional mood-stabilizing medications is poor, yet little is known about optimal treatment as there
have been no randomized medication trials for BD+CUD to date. Convergent evidence supports disrupted brain
gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate homeostasis as a promising target for pharmacological
intervention, and gabapentin as a candidate adjuvant medication to normalize frontal and striatal brain GABA
and glutamate levels, in BD+CUD. Against this background, we recently completed an NIH/NIDA-funded
(R21DA043917), double-blind, randomized, crossover, MRI (i.e., proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy [1H-
MRS], functional MRI [fMRI]) study of gabapentin (1200mg/day) vs. placebo in BD+CUD (n=22) which found
that, a) gabapentin increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right basal ganglia (rBG) glutamate
levels, the latter only in cigarette-smokers, b) relative elevations of rBG glutamate and dACC GABA levels in
gabapentin-treated participants were associated with lower cannabis use and mood symptoms, respectively,
and c) gabapentin increased activation to visual cannabis cues in the posterior midcingulate (pMCC) gyrus,
which was associated with increased rBG glutamate and GABA levels, as well as reduced cannabis use,
however only in smokers. Though promising, these findings must be interpreted with caution due to the study's
small sample size, observed randomization order effects, and post-hoc identification of statistical moderators, in
part guided by a failure of simple randomization to balance condition orders on participant characteristics; effects
of gabapentin on brain GABA, as opposed to glutamate, levels were additionally not as robust as anticipated.
The proposed randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, MRI study aims to evaluate whether
gabapentin increases dACC and rBG GABA and glutamate levels in BD+CUD, and whether normalization of
these levels will be associated with changes in brain cannabis-cue activation, cannabis use and craving, and
mood symptoms. This study will overcome the limitations of our preliminary study via, a) parallel-group study
design, b) a larger sample of enrolled BD+CUD individuals (n=68 vs. 22), c) urn-randomization to treatment
group, and d) a higher dose of gabapentin (1800mg/day) delivered over a longer period (17 days vs. 5
days/condition) to increase our likelihood of observing gabapentin effects on brain GABA levels. Positive results
may support investigation of gabapentin for the adjuvant treatment of BD+CUD in more clinically-focused RCTs.
The proposed study will also add to the literature on associations of regional brain GABA/glutamate levels with
constructs related to BD+CUD, including cue reactivity, cannabis use/craving, and mood and anxiety symptoms."

This project addresses the need for a better understanding of the causes of major depressive disorder (MDD)
as a way to improve diagnosis and treatment for the world's leading cause of disability. Genetic approaches, a
path to identifying causal factors and hence finding novel treatments, are proving successful in some psychiatric
disorders, but their application in MDD poses challenges, due to the condition's heterogeneity and the
importance of environmental factors. Success requires studies that take into account heterogeneity by assessing
multiple clinical features, and include measures of environmental risk factors. Furthermore, genetic studies need
to expand their reach to include multiple, ethnically diverse populations, so as to identify additional risk loci,
enable fine-mapping and the identification of likely causal variants, and expand the use of polygenic predictors
of disease to more populations. NIMH, in issuing PAR-20-026, “Genetic Architecture of Mental Disorders in
Ancestrally Diverse Populations”, recognizes this need and in response to this call, we have established an
international collaboration of investigators from South Korea and the United States, with a strong track record of
large-scale psychiatric genetic research in East Asia. We will create the largest East Asian cohort available for
the discovery of new MDD genes, increase the diversity of genetic discovery efforts (a step towards reducing
health disparities), and perform exhaustive analyses to identify likely causal variants and genes involved in MDD.
The aims of the consortium are as follows: Aim 1: To collect from South Korea DNA samples and phenotypes
from 10,000 women with severe recurrent MDD and from 10,000 matched, screened, controls. We will obtain a
comprehensive set of clinical features and risk factors, a deep set of phenotypes that provide a powerful resource
for gene identification. Aim 2: We will genotype samples, map risk loci for MDD in the Korean sample, identify
sources of heterogeneity and examine how genes and environment interact to cause MDD. Aim 3: Identify
genetic loci specific for MDD in a meta-analysis of East Asian cohorts, and refine likely sets of causal variants
by using trans-ancestry fine-mapping in cohorts of different ethnicities."
10879006,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 70% of US adults are overweight or obese, and the consequences can include increased risk for
several types of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Compared to their urban counterparts, rural
residents tend to have higher rates of cancer, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet. Rural residents also
have higher rates of poverty and lower rates of health insurance, and face unique challenges accessing
healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities, which contribute to these rural health disparities. Civic
engagement for built environment change (CEBEC) integrates resident-led community assessments with
environmental change initiatives aiming at improving population health. In several pilot studies, engaging and
empowering residents to identify solutions to improve community health have demonstrated successful
implementation. Evidence demonstrating positive change in behaviors and health outcomes using the CEBEC
approach are limited in scope and rigor but show notable and encouraging outcomes (e.g. increased physical
activity). This study proposes to evaluate a CEBEC intervention, the multilevel Change Club (CC) project,
which would be implemented in eight rural locations. The objective of the CC is to reduce rural risk factors for
obesity, cancer, and other chronic diseases through CEBEC physical activity and healthy eating projects. The
CC provides a menu of effective interventions; step-wise planning strategy; behavior change strategies and
goal setting; assessment and engagement tools; and ongoing support via conference calls, webinars, and
discussion boards to rural resident CCs, which typically include about 12-16 residents. For Aim 1, we will
evaluate individual-level health and behavioral outcomes in eight rural towns. We will measure outcomes in CC
members, local social network members (SNM) of CC members, and a sample of town residents recruited
through mass mailings and community events. The primary outcome is Simple 7 composite cardiovascular risk
score, which includes blood pressure, glucose and cholesterol, BMI, diet, smoking, and physical activity;
additional outcomes are knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and self-efficacy related to healthy eating and exercise,
including use of community resources for healthy eating, physical activity, and health care; and environmental
factors. Objective measures, including BMI, biochemical measures, accelerometry, dermal carotenoids, and
blood pressure, will be collected with CC members and a sample of SNM and town residents. Aim 2 includes a
mixed methods process evaluation examining unintended consequences; implementation barriers and
facilitators, including costs; and the effect of community/built environment/policy, social/collective, and
individual-level factors on intervention-specific outcomes. We will compare costs across sites and explore cost-
effectiveness of CC interventions relative to change in Simple 7 score. This project is an innovative opportunity
to evaluate multilevel rural CEBEC interventions focused on chronic disease risk factor behaviors. Outcome
and process data will provide critical insight into the viability of CEBEC interventions for future dissemination."
10863958,"Discovery of Drugs that Modulate Neuroinflammation for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease
Project Summary/Abstract (30 lines)
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the primary cause of dementia in the elderly. At present, approximately 36 million
people worldwide suffer with AD, and that number is expected to increase to about 120 million by 2040. Despite
decades of intense research, currently there are only four FDA-approved drugs to treat AD symptoms. These
drugs, however, do not prevent, stop or slow the progression of the disease.
Inflammation is considered a crucial link between Aβ plaques, NFTs and AD. Therefore, the modulation of pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines may be a viable approach to treat AD. In a screen to identify small molecule modulators
of inflammation, we identified a promising lead that has modest affinity for both the GABAA and TSPO receptors.
The preliminary SAR and data suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect derives from a combination of both
GABAA and TSPO activities. Continued optimization of both the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
properties of the lead will result in a significantly improved molecule that has the potential to treat both (i) cognitive
deficits and (ii) anxiety and aggression in AD. The specific aims to achieve this goal are:
Aim 1. In vivo proof of concept studies of etifoxine in two mouse models of AD. Etifoxine has demonstrated
beneficial effects in several neurodegenerative disease models; however, it was not tested in mouse models of
AD or in human AD patients. Therefore, we will evaluate the efficacy of etifoxine in (i) the rTG4510 (Tau
pathology) and (ii) the APP/PS1 (amyloid plaque) mouse models of AD.
Aim 2. Medicinal chemistry optimization and characterization of novel analogs of etifoxine. Single
enantiomer analogs of etifoxine will be designed, synthesized and characterized in biological assays. The most
promising compounds will be evaluated in drug-like property and PK studies. Compounds with appropriate PK
and brain exposure will advance into in vivo studies to measure target engagement (e.g., stimulation of
pregnenolone in mouse brain). Lead compounds also will be tested for sedative effects, and those that have
sedative potential will be deprioritized.
Aim 3. In vivo efficacy of the lead molecule in the rTG4510 mouse model of AD. We will evaluate the effects
of three different doses of the lead compound in the rTG4510 mouse model (as described in Aim 1), Treatment
will begin at 2 months (onset pathology), and end at 5 months (start of cognitive decline). The goal is to
demonstrate efficacy on multiple measures including inflammation, synaptic integrity, neurodegeneration, tau
pathogenesis, memory and learning.
Aim 4. Pre-IND enabling studies; scale-up synthesis, multi-species PK, and rodent toxicity. The goal is to
determine if the lead compound has any liabilities that would preclude its further development. The lead will be
tested in a battery of industry standard in vitro DMPK and in vitro toxicity studies (e.g., CYP inhibition, metabolite
identification, and safety panels). Finally, a 10-day, toxicity study will be performed to de-risk the lead compound.

The development of strategies to expand and activate AML specific T cells is of critical importance. We have
developed a personalized cancer vaccine in which patient derived tumor cells are fused with autologous
dendritic cells (DCs), presenting a broad array of antigens that capture the heterogeneity of the leukemia cell
population, including shared and neoantigens. We have completed a phase II clinical trial in which patients that
achieve remission following chemotherapy undergo serial vaccination with DC/AML fusions. Remarkably,
despite a median age of 63, 71% remained free of disease with a median follow up of 5 years. Vaccination was
associated with the expansion of T cells targeting both autologous AML cells and leukemia associated
antigens. The DC/AML vaccine can be used as a platform to generate activated leukemia-specific T cells ex-
vivo for adoptive immunotherapy. In this way, effector cells may be generated that are leukemia specific,
capture tumor heterogeneity, and are activated ex vivo to achieve a functionally competent phenotype. We
have demonstrated that vaccine stimulation in the context of IL7/IL-15 results in enhanced levels of central
memory cells critical for long term persistence of response. While the generation of vaccine stimulated
leukemia specific T cells ex vivo represents a promising strategy to effectively target AML cells in vivo, the
immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment remains a barrier to the development of a memory
response and long-term protection. We performed transcriptome analysis in the remission bone marrow at
time of vaccination to identify biomarkers that were predictive of durable response as compared to early
relapse following vaccination with DC/AML fusions. Of note, decreased expression of TGF-β in the bone
marrow microenvironment was associated with durable remission. These results are consistent with prior
reports suggesting TGF-β as a negative regulator of tumor immunogenicity, T cell activation and infiltration
into the tumor bed. As such there is strong rationale to target TGFβ to enhance vaccine efficacy. In the
present study, we will create a novel strategy for adoptive T cell therapy generated by vaccine mediated
stimulation, selection of antigen specific T cells and ex vivo expansion. Functional characteristics will be
examined in an immunocompetent murine leukemia model. We will then examine the effect of TGF-β inhibition
on vaccine response and TGF inhibition within vaccine stimulated T cells by silencing of the downstream
effector SMAD2. In the second aim, the T cell product will be characterized with respect to targeting of shared
and neo-antigen targets, oligoclonal expansion and diversity of the repertoire, expression of markers of
activation, exhaustion, senescence, and chemokines needed for migration into the tumor bed. In the third aim,
we will conduct a Phase I study in which patients with AML who achieve complete remission will undergo
adoptive therapy with vaccine stimulated T cells."
10890765,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This K23 career development award will position the candidate to become an independent clinical researcher
with expertise in refining and testing pharmaco-behavioral interventions for pain management in patients under
intensive rehabilitation. BACKGROUND. Pain is a significant problem for inpatients, and opioids are often used
as a part of their analgesic treatment approach. Unfortunately, adequate pain relief by narcotic comes with
adverse effects and risk of addiction. Overall, opioid usage for those in Comprehensive Inpatient Rehabilitation
(CIR) is high due to the complexity of their injuries. Notably, pain in rehabilitation leads to worsened clinical
outcomes, due to maladaptive healthcare engagement (e.g., avoidance or overuse of physical therapy). It is
critical to developing evidence-based pharmaco-behavioral interventions, and Conditioning Open-Label Placebo
(COLP) is a promising technique for reducing opioid use in CIR. Based on principles of classical conditioning,
COLP takes advantage of opioids pharmacology to promote learned responses for evoked placebo-driven
analgesia. SPECIFIC AIMS. The proposed studies employ mixed methods designs to: (1) evaluate, in a pilot
randomized clinical trial (RCT), the feasibility and acceptability of COLP for patients with pain in CIR, (2) explore
neurophysiological mechanisms and markers associated with COLP, and (3) explore within-group longitudinal
patterns of pain management and their covariance across multiple timepoints. TRAINING. The candidate will
achieve short-term goals through a resource-rich institutional environment and a cohesive training plan in (1)
clinical trial design in CIR, (2) neurophysiology and signal analysis and longitudinal data collection, and (3)
evaluation of pain management, including; beliefs, expectations, and attitudes toward the treatment. In addition
to ongoing mentorship meetings and experiential training through the research plan, the candidate will complete
targeted coursework, didactic training, and clinical shadowing. Presentations at local/national conferences, and
publish in peer-reviewed journals, are activities also included in candidate’s training. MENTORSHIP. The
candidate will be supported by a stellar mentoring team: Ross Zafonte, DO (primary mentor), Ted Kaptchuk
(primary mentor) Gloria Y. Yeh, MD, MPH (co-mentor), Christine Sang, MD, MPH (co-mentor), Kevin O’Connor,
MD (consultant), and Jeffrey Schneider (consultant). IMPACT. In line with NCMRR funding priorities, the
proposed research will answer critical questions about (1) the feasibility and acceptability of a multimodal
approach involving pharmaco-behavioral interventions for hard-to-manage symptoms and (2) develop objective
biomarkers associated with the experimental intervention. While the initial clinical trial will focus on pain in CIR,
it is anticipated that the candidate’s training and research will have broad applications to a variety of medical
populations struggling with pain and narcotic treatment management. Through this K23 award, the candidate
will gain the training and preliminary data needed to apply for a larger NCMRR clinical trial (e.g., R01 or U01) to
determine the optimal integration of COLP for managing pain in patients undergoing intensive rehabilitation."
10828437,"Project Summary
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical procedure that involves implanting electrodes into specific areas
within the brain and delivering constant or intermittent electric pulses from an implanted pulse generator (IPG)
to modulate neural function. DBS is the gold standard treatment for Parkinson’s disease, and has shown promise
in treating other disorders, most notably chronic pain, epilepsy, major depression, and Alzheimer’s disease.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extremely useful in patients with DBS implants, as it can provide
information on precise location of implanted electrodes and functional response to stimulation. Unfortunately,
the interaction of radiofrequency (RF) fields generated by MRI scanners with the leads of DBS devices can
trigger potentially fatal RF heating within the tissue. This means that current MRI technology is inaccessible to
most patients with DBS implants, presenting a significant barrier to progress in the field of DBS therapeutics.
This project seeks to develop novel MRI methodologies alongside DBS implantation techniques that together
will make cutting-edge MRI technology fully compatible with implanted DBS devices. Here, this two-pronged
approach takes the form of (1) building on our recently introduced concept of reconfigurable MRI technology;
and (2) establishing surgical guidelines specific to DBS device implantation.
Reconfigurable MRI technology is based on the idea that through innovative engineering we can control local
electric fields generated by MR on a patient-by-patient basis, thus avoiding interactions with an implanted device,
wherever it happens to be. Part and parcel with engineering-based solutions, we recognize the importance of
DBS device lead placement in optimizing the success of the reconfigurable MRI approach. Although RF heating
depends exquisitely on lead-trajectory, surgical guidelines are completely silent as to how to best place the
extracranial portion of the leads. This in turn leads to arbitrary (and highly variable) lead positioning, which can
make RF heating unpredictable even when using reconfigurable technology. Thus, we propose work to develop
and validate novel MR technology (Aim 1), intra-surgical implantation strategies (Aim 2), and simulation-based,
patient-specific approaches to defining safe imaging parameters (Aim 3). Together, these efforts will eliminate
RF heating, reduce image artifact, and support the use of next generation MRI in patients with DBS implants.
Our team includes experts in MRI hardware development and instrumentation, MRI computational modeling and
safety assessment, FDA regulatory scientists, DBS clinical management and neurosurgery, as well as
collaborators from DBS device industry. If successful, we will bring state-of-the-art 3T MRI to DBS patients in
its full capacity. This will allow for methodical analysis of DBS parameters/targets in emerging applications,
improve our understanding of DBS in existing indications, and bring standard-of-care imaging to patients with
existing DBS implants."

Although single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technologies have advanced in recent years to enable routine
sequencing and assembly of human genomes, new software is required to utilize the potential of SMS in human
genetics. The long term goal is to help improve our understanding of complex variation in human diversity and
its role in disease. To achieve this, we will develop methods to (1) detect variation in SMS reads, (2) assemble
duplicated sequences missing from SMS de novo assemblies, and (3) genotype complex variation in large HTS
datasets using lightweight data structures. While several years of algorithm development for SMS data have
resulted in an software ecosystem to detect variation in SMS genomes, the rationale for the need to continue
development is that sensitivity and specificity are not yet sufficient for disease studies, important classes of
variation are not resolved by current assembly approaches, and the knowledge gained from sequencing SMS
genomes must be used to improve what can be discovered in large disease studies that rely heavily on short
read data such as those conducted under TOPMed. The algorithmic innovations we will provide for SMS data
are an alignment algorithm that explicitly optimizes over rearranged sequences, an assembly approach that
exploits minor differences between duplication copies to resolve genome function. Software will be supported
through Bioconda installation and distributed test cases. Once a variant is discovered by SMS, it may be more
easily genotyped in short read data. We will develop methods to generate databases of SMS variation that may
be queried with short read data. To aid in development of assembly algorithms for duplicated sequences, we will
generate a public resource of SMS data for individuals with known copy number polymorphisms. The significance
of this work is to enable SMS genomes to be used in disease studies, both by uncovering previously hidden
variation, and by increasing the amount of variation found in large short-read datasets."
10880608,"Increased age, presence of other cardiovascular risk factors or previous treatment with anti-cancer therapy are
among the leading risk factors for development of coronary artery disease (CAD). While CAD is traditionally
viewed as a large vessel disease substantial recent data indicate that impaired microvascular function
contributes substantially to pathophysiology and outcomes in cardiovascular disease. Subjects with a clinical
diagnosis of CAD exhibit loss of NO-mediated microvascular flow-mediated dilation (FMD) concurrent with
upregulation of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), promoting local inflammation and cellular proliferation.
Understanding the contributing mechanisms that regulate the switch from NO to H2O2 may help to reduce the
risk of tissue injury from vascular paracrine redox toxicity.
We have identified several components of the signaling pathway that changes the mediator of FMD from NO to
H2O2. The common feature of each of these pathways is excess endothelial mitochondrial ROS generation.
Mitochondrial fission and fusion, known regulators of ROS production, are tightly regulated by a group of pro-
fission and pro-fusion proteins suggesting the possibility that these factors determine the mediator of FMD in the
human microvasculature, an unexplored question. The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that
mitochondrial fission/fusion is critically linked to the mediator of FMD in the human microcirculation. Based on
preliminary data we expect that regulators of fission/fusion are fundamental mediators of mitochondrial ROS
production and determinants of whether shear elicits release of endothelial NO or H2O2.
Mitochondria and ROS are also involved in hypoxic preconditioning (HPC), a stimulus that improves tissue
tolerance to stressors and protects against disease. Very little is known about HPC and vascular protection with
no studies in the microcirculation. Our preliminary data support a role for mitochondrial fission and fusion in
mediating HPC. This potential mechanism for HPC induced vascular protection will be explored. We will study
fresh human coronary and adipose arterioles and primary human microvascular endothelial cells in vitro using
pharmacological and genetic tools to manipulate fission and fusion mediators and determine how these changes
contribute to alterations in mechanisms of FMD observed in CAD or after acute stress (elevated glucose,
intraluminal pressure). We will test the overreaching hypothesis that mitochondrial fission is associated with H2O2
while mitochondrial fusion promotes physiological NO mediated dilation to flow.
 Aim 1: Changes in fission/fusion or its regulators are necessary and sufficient to explain the
transition in the mediator of FMD from NO to H2O2 during CAD or vascular stress (IILP or HG)
 Aim 2: Investigate whether the mechanism by which hypoxic vascular preconditioning improves
microvascular function after acute stress (IILP, HG) or in subjects with CAD involves an increase in
mitochondrial fusion."
10873114,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While most people with psychosis are not dangerous and most violence is committed by non-psychotic people,
people with psychotic disorders are at increased risk for violence, and violence is associated with worse
outcomes and increased stigma. Therefore, decreasing violence risk in psychosis is clinically relevant and has
important public health implications. Several clinical studies suggest that clozapine is superior to other
antipsychotic medications in reducing violence or aggression. However, there were numerous limitations of
these studies including that most of them were observational and non-randomized, included small sample sizes,
or focused on hostility, non-physical aggression, or self-harm, rather than violent acts. Further, the majority of
these trials were not generalizable to outpatient, community settings. No large effectiveness study has
examined the effects of clozapine on violent behavior in community settings. We propose a randomized,
parallel-group, 24-week, open-label, single (rater)-blind, 7-site clinical trial to examine the effects of treatment
with clozapine vs. treatment as usual (TAU) on the risk of violent acts in 280 individuals with schizophrenia at
high risk for violence. This trial will be a collaboration of 7 sites, coordinated by the New York State Psychiatric
Institute. The 6 additional collaborating sites contribute unique expertise and will ensure an adequate sample
size for this trial. Our primary effectiveness outcome is time to violent acts as measured by the MacArthur
Community Violence Interview (MCVI). We will also explore the effects of clozapine on the Point Subtraction
Aggression Paradigm. While many factors may contribute to violent behavior in individuals with schizophrenia,
including positive symptoms, psychopathy, impulsivity, and substance use, evidence suggests that the final
common pathway for many of these disparate causal influences likely runs through behaviors captured by the
Excitement Factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (i.e., a composite of the scores of excitement,
uncooperativeness, poor impulse control, and hostility). Importantly, our target (the excitement factor of the
PANSS) has been validated to measure excitement-like symptoms in clinical trials in schizophrenia, is sensitive
to treatment, has been linked to the neurobiology of violence in MRI and PET studies, and differentiates
clozapine from other antipsychotic drugs. We will also explore the effects of clozapine vs. TAU on positive
symptoms (e.g., persecutory delusions) and alcohol and substance use, and how these effects influence the
risk for violent acts. To enhance the safe implementation of this study in this vulnerable population at risk of
violent behaviors, we will implement clinical safety and treatment engagement protocols that rely upon standard
personnel and that will be readily generalizable. This trial will provide guidance on the use of clozapine for
violence in community settings and will definitively test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of its anti-violence
effects. The results will be immediately relevant to practice and will impact public health because there is
currently no standard approach for the treatment of violence in schizophrenia."
10873793,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To adapt and survive in natural environments, animals need to learn to discriminate sensory stimuli predicting
different outcomes. This ability is particularly important in the case of largely overlapping sensory inputs. For
example, in taste, small differences between otherwise similar solutions could mean the difference between
ingesting a poison and having a safe meal. This phenomenon, known as perceptual learning, has been well
documented across species and sensory modalities. However, understanding the mechanisms of neural plas-
ticity underlying perceptual learning - i.e. how the brain plastically encodes, generalizes and discriminates large
numbers of overlapping stimuli - remains a great challenge in neuroscientific research. Studies in the visual and
auditory systems have converged on two non-mutually exclusive models, 1) enhancement of sensory represen-
tations and 2) improved ability of decision-making circuits to interpret sensory evidence to guide actions. Gener-
ally, these two types of activity are found in different brain areas, however both types can be found in the primary
taste cortex, known as the gustatory insular cortex (GC). This makes taste an ideal system to test relative con-
tributions of the two models. Additionally, the mechanisms of plasticity underlying perceptual learning remain
incompletely understood, but some studies have suggested a role for the neuromodulator, dopamine. The cur-
rent proposal will test the hypotheses that 1) representations of overlapping taste stimuli and associated deci-
sions by GC neurons separate as mice learn a perceptual discrimination task; 2) GC DAergic signaling mediates
plasticity underlying task learning and performance. I will rely on a taste-based two alternative forced choice
(2AFC) in which mice are trained to detect the predominant taste in a mixture. To study chemosensory and
decision-related coding in GC, I will use chronic 2-photon and widefield calcium imaging in populations of GC
neurons as mice learn. To parse the role of dopamine in task learning and performance, I will use selective
lesioning of GC dopaminergic axons and local chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine transmission combined with
calcium imaging. These experiments will provide important information about taste processing, the neural basis
of perceptual learning and the role of cortical dopamine in taste and sensory processing more broadly."
10877805,"One of the greatest mysteries in biology concerns how life has perpetuated, and continues to 
perpetuate, from generation to generation. A key feature of the mammalian germline is 
its sexual dimorphism: spermatogenesis and oogenesis. These dimorphic developmental 
processes are inherently complex, and this complexity poses significant challenges to 
understanding the perpetuity of life and the development of treatments for various germline-derived 
genetic and epigenetic diseases. Thus, in this R35 application, our research directions converge 
to address the following question: How do epigenetic mechanisms govern distinct sexually 
dimorphic processes in spermatogenesis and oogenesis, culminating in the generation of functional 
sperm and eggs? Since I became independent ten years ago, I and my team have worked to construct 
 a detailed picture of the epigenetic mechanisms that govern mammalian spermatogenesis. We 
have shown that the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in germ cell development is notable for not only 
global changes in gene expression but the dynamic reorganization of the epigenome; in brief, we 
have revealed that meiosis itself is a process of global epigenomic reprogramming. My research 
program has pioneered these concepts and developed innovative approaches to decode germline 
mechanisms crucial for preparing the next generation, providing a rigorous foundation for future 
research.
To understand key sexually dimorphic processes, we focus on fundamental 
processes in spermatogenesis and oogenesis. In spermatogenesis, postnatal germ cells enter a stem 
cell stage, undergo meiosis, and sustain long-term production of sperm. We will elucidate the 
global epigenetic mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis from the stem cell stage to sperm 
production, with an emphasis on dynamic changes in the epigenetic machinery and their 
importance to the next generation. Since, in males, meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) 
functions as a key sexually dimorphic process, we will also determine the molecular functions of 
DNA damage response pathways-which direct MSCl-in the epigenetic regulation of the sex chromosomes. 
In contrast, female germ cells undergo meiosis in embryos and enter a prolonged stage of 
meiotic arrest-spanning decades in humans-prior to oocyte maturation. We will determine 
epigenetic mechanisms underlying critical stages of oogenesis to complement our study of 
male germ cells. Ultimately, we will reveal distinct features and unifying principles of 
spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Taking all of this together, we are uniquely positioned to clarify 
how fundamental germline mechanisms intersect to ensure genome maintenance, genome defense, and 
epigenetic gene regulation on a systemic level. The research directions proposed in this 
application are cohesive and synergistic, with high potential to sustain research 
progress and inform significant, transformative advances in germline biology, human 
reproduction, and reproductive health in general."

African Americans (AAs) bear a disproportionately high burden of lung cancer (LC)―AA males have a much
higher likelihood of developing LC and dying from LC than any other race and ethnic groups. Currently, little is
known about the potential contributors to the LC disparities. Menthol cigarette smoking is the most distinctive
feature that defines AA smokers, leading to speculation that menthol cigarette smoking may contribute, in part,
to the extra burden of LC among AAs. However, epidemiologic studies to date could not bring a full explanation
of the role and/or harms of menthol cigarette smoking in LC etiology owing to questionnaire-only investigations,
potential reverse causality, and insufficient numbers of AAs, menthol smokers, and examined metabolites.
Moreover, previous studies did not comprehensively explore the underlying mechanisms of menthol cigarette
smoking and lung carcinogenesis, highlighting the need for innovative research to investigate the hidden clues
that can explain disproportional burdens and disparities related to menthol cigarette smoking among AAs. To
fill the knowledge gaps in epidemiologic evidence and address the actual hazards of menthol cigarettes in LC
etiology, we propose the first population-based prospective study incorporating a multi-stage metabolomics
approach to identify the menthol cigarette smoking-related metabolites and their associations with LC risk in a
comprehensive and cost-efficient way. Leveraging pre-diagnostic blood samples, rich epidemiologic data, and
recently generated metabolomics data in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), an NCI-funded
prospective cohort, we aim to 1) identify menthol cigarette smoking-related blood metabolites using the
Metabolon’s Global Metabolomics platform (~1,500 metabolites in eight super pathways) among 959 cancer-
free current smokers (617 AAs and 342 EAs) and further evaluate the possible associations of menthol
cigarette smoking-related blood metabolites with race, sex, age, smoking intensity/duration, and other
known/suggested risk factors for LC (Aim 1); and 2) conduct a nested case-control study to investigate the
associations of each menthol cigarette smoking-related metabolite and a standardized metabolite risk score
with LC risk, using pre-diagnostic blood samples of 80 pairs of incident LC cases (adenocarcinoma) and
matched controls who were selected from cancer-free AA male current smokers within the SCCS (Aim 2).
Findings from this proposed study will advance our knowledge of the actual hazards of menthol cigarette
smoking in LC etiology, provide important insight into the pathogenic/molecular pathways of menthol cigarette
smoking, and generate valuable information to develop new public health strategies for LC prevention mainly
targeted at racially/ethnically disadvantaged people. Furthermore, this proposed study will bring a mechanistic
explanation of menthol cigarette smoking, a potential contributor to a disproportionately high burden of LC
among AAs, and thus help elucidate hidden clues underlying the racial/ethnic disparities in LC, which fills the
knowledge gaps in LC disparities research regarding the smoking paradox among AAs."

Stress is a fundamental pathway to race/ethnic variation in health and aging. Black older adults experience
more stressors over their life course and age faster than other groups as evidenced by earlier onset of most
diseases and declines in biological, physical and cognitive functioning. One of the underlying mechanisms
connecting stress to multiple age-related diseases is epigenetic changes, now termed one of the “hallmarks of
aging.” Large, diverse national data sets have invested time and money in collecting DNA methylation
(DNAm)—a common measure of epigenetic changes—in multiethnic samples, providing mechanistic insights
into an individual’s molecular response to environmental stressors that underlie disease processes and inform
our understanding of the biological processes through which social disparities in health manifest. Integrating
epigenetics into population-level race-based health disparities research is important given the unequal, and
rapid aging of racial/ethnic minority populations and the huge investment in DNAm across different study
designs, race/ethnic groups, ancestries, and at different ages. The proposed project compares the stress,
anthropometric, biological, and epigenetic age profiles of Black and African ancestry older adults across age
cohorts (young-old and long-lived) in both the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Study of Longevity
and Stress in African American Families (SOLSAA). Sitting at the cusp of the genomic data revolution, this
proposal will ensure I get the training I need as a biosocial gerontologist to work independently with social
stress, biosocial, and epigenetic data across distinct data sets of older Black adults and fulfill the objectives
outlined in this proposal. Through the K01 Career Development Award, I will combine my extensive experience
studying race/ethnic disparities in stress and aging and will gain additional training in molecular biology,
bioinformatics, epidemiology, epigenetic mechanisms, bioethics and professional development. San Diego
State University School of Public Health is an ideal location to receive the skills needed during the training
phase given the multidisciplinary nature and close connection with UCSD through joint doctoral programs, the
Stein Institute of Aging, and San Diego Alzheimer’s Disease Resource Center as well as availability of
coursework, and mentorship from leaders in genetic epidemiology, social genomics, and bioinformatics.
Completion of the training and research aims will result in scientific presentations and publications, preliminary
data to successfully compete for R01 funding that integrates longitudinal DNAm data (currently being collected)
in diverse, longitudinal cohort studies of aging with life course stress and longitudinal health outcomes. This
project will improve measures of aging in Black communities, providing a more accurate picture of the aging
experience. This study will also support a paradigm shift in aging research, combining medical frameworks with
Black centered social frameworks that challenge racialized narratives of health, improve our understanding of
aging, and support insight for the planning of aging resources among Black populations."
10897315,"Project Summary:
Total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation (TP-IAT) are currently performed in around 20 centers
worldwide for the treatment of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Major problems associated with TP-IAT are poor islet
engraftment and dysfunction after intraportal infusion. Because of these issues, only around 20% of the non-
diabetic CP patients are insulin-independent after surgery. Currently, interventional protocols to increase the
survival of the islet graft following transplantation are empiric. Thus, effective therapies that can facilitate islet
cell engraftment and promote survival after transplantation are urgently needed.
Multiple studies including our own demonstrate that islet co-transplantation with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
enhances islet engraftment, decreases number of islets needed to achieve normoglycemia in rodent and
nonhuman primate islet transplantation models. MSCs exert such effects mainly via direct cell-cell contact and
their paracrine secretion of protective molecules including insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1), hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF), transforming growth factor β (TGF- β) and others. We are the first group who performed a pilot
NIH-funded clinical trial evaluating the feasibility of autologous bone marrow-derived ex vivo-expanded MSCs
(BM-MSCS) and islet co-transplantation in CP patients. Although only three subjects received MSC and islet co-
transplantation due to the pilot nature of the grant, our data showed that BM-MSCs and islet co-transplantation
was a safe and promising strategy to improve islet engraftment after transplantation. Based on this unique clinical
trial experience and animal studies, the goal of this study is to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of
autologous MSCs and islet co-transplantation in a larger TP-IAT patient population. Our hypothesis is that co-
transplantation of islets with autologous BM-MSCs can enhance islet survival and function after transplantation,
resulting in more CP patients being diabetes free after TP-IAT. A critical part of this trial will be to define the
mechanisms by which MSCs modulate β cell survival and explore cellular and molecular biomarkers that can be
used as indicator(s) for β cell death and the potential response/efficacy of MSC therapy. Results from these
studies are not only urgently needed for the prevention of post-surgical diabetes in CP patients, but also may
offer useful information on which to address the more complex allogeneic islet cell transplantation for patients
with type 1 diabetes."
10802417,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) cause substantial mortality and morbidity. Current treatments that block
pathological inflammatory responses have improved clinical outcomes in some patients but they are not highly
effective in modifying disease progression or preventing relapses. Hence, there is a large unmet need to develop
novel therapeutic targets. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer an unbiased approach to identify
therapeutic targets in relevant immune cell types such as CD4+ T cells that play key roles in IBD pathogenesis.
Because T cells are quiescent in the absence of extrinsic stimulation, it is not possible to fully examine the effects
of disease-risk variants on functionally relevant effector genes under resting conditions. To identify IBD-risk
genes in activated CD4+ T cells, we performed the first large-scale single-cell eQTL study on activated CD4+ T
cells. We found that reduced expression of Leukocyte-specific protein 1 (LSP1), specifically in activated CD4+
T-cell subsets such as TH1 and TH17 cells, was associated with the risk of IBD. In this R01 proposal, we will
investigate how reduced levels of LSP1 influences the differentiation and function of CD4+ T cells to drive disease
pathogenesis, and will test the hypothesis that LSP1 plays a key role in restraining the re-programming of CD4+
T cells into a more pathogenic cell state in IBD patients.
In Aim 1, we will determine the functional IBD-risk variants that reduce LSP1 expression in CD4+ T cells. We will
employ luciferase reporter assays to determine functional variants in the enhancers and promoter of LSP1,
perform CRISPR-mediated editing of prioritized IBD-risk eQTLs to define causal variants, and perform CRISPRi
and ChIP assays to determine functional enhancers, relevant up-stream regulators and whether the functional
LSP1 eQTLs directly perturb the binding of key transcription factors that modulate LSP1 expression.
In Aim 2, we will determine the role of LSP1 in reprogramming of CD4+ T cells into the pathogenic state observed
in IBD. To determine whether LSP1 influences the differentiation and pathogenic function of CD4+ T cells from
healthy and IBD donors, we will reduce and increase LSP1 levels and assess the effects on CD4+ T-cell
activation, apoptosis, proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production. In an adoptive T cell transfer model
of colitis, we will compare the ability of Lsp1- sufficient (wild-type) and Lsp1-deficient CD4+ T cells in driving
colonic inflammation and pathogenic TH1 and TH17 differentiation. We will determine whether reducing Lsp1
expression in CD4+ T cells enhances their pathogenicity in mouse models of colitis, thus implicating an important
T cell-intrinsic role for LSP1 in IBD pathogenesis.
Overall, this study, examining the function, expression, activation and regulation of LSP1 in CD4+ T cells, will
provide important mechanistic insights into the genetic basis of risk for inflammatory bowel disease."
11085681,"Normal structure and function of the lung is maintained in homeostasis and repaired/regenerated following
diverse injuries by regionally defined stem/progenitor cells. Stem cells reside in unique tissue
microenvironments, known as the stem cell “niche”, which constitutes stem cell progeny, other niche-support
cells including mesenchymal cells (MCs), and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). The stem cell niche
provides instructive cues for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Fibrotic lungs undergo substantial
changes in the tissue biomechanical properties, manifested by stiffening of the ECM. Cells residing in the stem
cell niche sense and respond to alterations in the stiffness of the microenvironment, highlighting matrix
stiffness as an important mechanical component of the stem cell niche. In preliminary studies, we have
characterized the stiffness of alveolar type 2 epithelial stem cell (AT2) niche associated with Pdgfrα+ lung MCs.
Alveolar organoid culture in newly developed, stiffness-tunable 3D hydrogels demonstrated that matrix
stiffness constitutes an AT2 niche. We recently identified that α6-integrin is a mechanosensitive integrin
subunit; stiff matrix-induced α6 expression, primarily an α6 isoform with a shorter cytoplasmic domain (α6S),
mediates lung fibroblast invasion into the basement membrane. New preliminary data now show that in
addition to α6 expression, matrix stiffness regulates alternative splicing of α6 pre-mRNA in Pdgfrα+ lung MCs,
resulting in differential expression of a distinct α6 isoform with a longer cytoplasmic domain (α6L) under soft
/homeostatic matrix conditions and a switch from α6L to α6S predominance under stiff/fibrotic matrix
conditions. We found that α6L expression promotes lipogenic differentiation of lung MCs and confers the AT2-
niche function, facilitating reinstatement of lung homeostasis. In contrast, α6S expression impairs the AT2-
niche function and promotes fibrogenic/invasive differentiation of lung MCs, contributing to lung fibrosis. In this
proposal, we hypothesize that matrix stiffness-dependent alternative splicing of α6-integrin regulates the repair
of injured lungs by controlling alveolotrophic vs. fibrogenic differentiation of lung mesenchymal cells. Specific
aims in the proposed study are: (1) determination of the mechanisms by which matrix stiffness regulates
alternative splicing of α6-integrin; (2) determination of the mechanisms by which distinct α6-integrin
cytoplasmic variants mediate alveolotrophic vs. fibrogenic differentiation of lung mesenchymal cells; and (3)
testing the potential of targeting matrix stiffness-dependent alternative splicing of α6-integrin for the reversal of
sustained pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Understanding the mechanisms by which lung epithelial stem cells
interact with their niches in normal vs. pathological repair of the injured lung will provide novel therapeutic
approaches to prevent, treat, and potentially reverse pulmonary fibrosis."
10809640,"ABSTRACT: ECHO PROJECT
Patients undergoing complex surgeries are most vulnerable during the immediate postoperative period; thus,
handoffs from the OR (operating room) to ICU (intensive care unit) require seamless communication and
coordination between surgical, anesthesia, and critical care teams. Postoperative handoffs are a threat to
patient safety, causing ~35% of medical errors in the US. To mitigate these errors, the National Patient Safety
Goal (2E) necessitated the “standardization” of handoff process and content, which resulted in adoption of
information transfer checklists, handoff process-based protocols, or both. Although such strategies have
improved handoff quality, our meta-analysis found that such improvements were temporary and had limited
sustainability, due to the structured formats imposing “rigid” standardization with limited flexibility and support
for interactive and personalized communication. Our central hypothesis is that a flexible standardization
approach will lead to not only improvements in information sharing, but also improvements in shared
understanding of patient risks, handoff interactivity, and handoff duration. Towards this end, we propose to
develop the INTERACT (Intelligent interactive care continuity) handoff bundle, a flexible, standardized, EHR-
integrated, and resilient sociotechnical intervention comprised of a: (1) telemedicine-augmented handoff
process (i.e., the social component) supported by a (2) machine learning (ML)-augmented handoff report (i.e.,
the technical component). INTERACT underscores the importance of using a perioperative telemedicine suite
as a safety net to support resilience to errors in OR-ICU handoff process and content. The ML-augmented
handoff report supports personalized communication of core (i.e., standardized) and tailored (flexible) content
based on predicted patient risks for postoperative complications. Aim 1 will focus on updating our current ML
models for predicting risks associated with postoperative complications, based on state-of-the-art imputation
and feature engineering techniques. We will enhance our model-agnostic explanation framework to support
postoperative handoffs and decision-making, which will also be validated with a summative user evaluation
study. Aim 2 will follow a user-centered design approach to iteratively develop and test the INTERACT bundle
including handoff report design ideation, and usability testing, and lastly, the INTERACT bundle in-situ
simulations. Aim 3 will adopt a Hybrid Type 1 trial design and the Care Transitions Framework to evaluate the
effectiveness and implementation-potential of the INTERACT bundle. Our primary outcome is information
sharing score (i.e., a measure of information completeness), while secondary outcomes include information
inaccuracies, realized errors and adverse events, and ICU length of stay. With an integrated multidisciplinary
approach to improving perioperative care transitions, the proposed INTERACT bundle will address the stated
AHRQ FOA goals of “defragmenting information, improving communication, and assuring care team access to
reliable and complete health information; and empowering care teams to improve health outcomes.”"
10839460,"ABSTRACT
Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) of solid organ transplants is the leading cause of immunologic graft injury,
shortening the half-life of transplants and consequently of transplant recipients. This immunologically mediated
process depends on B lymphocyte activation with differentiation to plasma cells (PC) that produce antibodies to
the donor organ. Once established, antibodies have proven difficult to eradicate. Establishing an effective and
safe way to treat patients with established AMR would potentially increase the half-life of transplanted organs,
extend the lives of patients, and reduce the need for re-transplantation, ultimately increasing the number of
patients who could receive life-saving organ transplants. Our lab has described an effective therapy in a non-
human primate (NHP) sensitized model of kidney transplantation for lowering donor-specific antibody (DSA) and
preventing injury from AMR. The treatment depends on PC depletion in combination with germinal center
disorganization which together lower alloantibody levels. Dual targeting of the immune system by complementary
drugs is based on NHP and human data using a proteasome inhibitor and belatacept. B cell activation and
differentiation is inhibited at the same time that PC are depleted. Consequently, DSA declines, inflammation in
the kidney resolves, and renal function stabilizes. The impact of this intervention on infection risk is not well
defined but is anticipated to increase. We propose to measure the impact of therapy on both HLA-specific and
pathogen-specific B memory cells and PC. We hypothesize that there is a hierarchy of susceptibility to therapy,
with protective immunity being more resistant than allogeneic B cell memory. We will evaluate the impact of the
regimen on T-cell function focusing on cytomegalovirus (CMV). Current therapy of late AMR using therapeutic
plasma exchange (TPE) and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) with or without rituximab has shown variable
results and frequent rebound of DSA. A low level of evidence supports the efficacy of these treatments, implying
a tremendous need for well-conducted clinical trials to guide treatment of AMR. We propose a Phase I/II
randomized, controlled, prospective interventional study of AMR in human kidney transplant patients using
combined carfilzomib/belatacept (C/B) therapy with TPE and IVIG compared to TPE/IVIG alone. Outcomes will
include the clinical impact of therapy on AMR using the recently validated iBox score for AMR assessment and
the number and type of infections using standardized definitions of infection. We will measure the impact of
therapy on HLA and pathogen-associated B memory and PC as well as CMV-specific polyfunctional T-cells. We
will assess computational digital imaging analysis of AMR non-visual biopsy features to assess whether machine
learning algorithms can improve on Banff criteria of AMR to better guide treatment and predict clinical outcome.
Since late active and chronic active AMR have such a poor prognosis for kidney transplant patients, we believe
that this trial is ethically justified and would potentially yield important safety and preliminary efficacy data that
may lead to improved immune management of transplant patients."
10833547,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Protein citrullination is increased in inflammatory disease and cancer, and the evidence indicates that this
post-translational modification is a major contributor to disease pathogenesis. In fact, inhibition of protein
citrullination decreases disease severity in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, nerve
damage, and cancer. Thus, the Protein Arginine Deiminases (PADs), which catalyze this PTM, represent novel
therapeutic targets.
 The overall goal of this renewal application is to investigate how protein citrullination impacts human cell
signaling. Specific questions to be addressed include: (1) What proteins are citrullinated?; (2) How does
citrullination affect activity?; (3) Does citrullination impact proteolytic events? and (4) Can we generate
isozyme specific inhibitors? Answers to these questions will be obtained by (1) developing chemoproteomic
platforms to identify citrullination events; (2) developing and using a genetic code expansion platform to
evaluate the functional consequences of individual citrullination events; and (3) developing chemical probes
and isozyme selective PAD inhibitors to modulate cellular citrullination levels. By addressing each of these
questions, the PI expects to provide a holistic understanding for how the PADs contribute to human biology.
 Given the outstanding track record of the PI and his leadership position in the PAD field, combined with his
strong network of collaborators, this project will provide new insights and sorely needed research tools to the
scientific community. Key outcomes include the discovery of new PAD biology, which is predicted to have
major translational impacts on autoimmunity and cancer."
10983284,"Background: On a given night around 40,000 Veterans are homeless and another 300,000 are at risk. Many
of these Veterans have complex health and social needs, and they experience frequent residential transitions
which can disrupt access to healthcare and treatment adherence. Many persons who are housing unstable
experience frequent residential transitions, such as from transitional housing to shelter, or from doubled up with
family/friend to living out of a car. Disruptions caused by such transitions likely contribute to this population's
poor health by interfering with access to care and treatment adherence. Despite the potential harm, there is a
major gap in detailed, contextual knowledge of these transitions, especially from the perspective of the
individuals experiencing them – such as their in-the-moment emotions, behaviors, geographic movements, and
social support. Filling this gap would improve knowledge of Veterans' trajectories into and out of
homelessness and their day-to-day barriers to health care and other services. New approaches are needed.
Research has shown that most persons experiencing homelessness have mobile phones, and increasingly
they are smartphones. This provides an opportunity to gather near real-time information, at relatively low cost,
that would help improve understanding of Veterans' changes in housing, health, mood, and use of services.
Significance/Impact: Homelessness among Veterans represents one of the worst failures of our national and
VA health care and social service systems. Health is poor, and life expectancy for homeless persons is 10 to
20 years shorter than for housed populations. The work proposed here will contribute to VA priorities of
improving access to care, increasing virtual care/telehealth, and improving the health of homeless Veterans.
Innovation: We propose the first significant test of passive and active mobile phone data collection among
homeless Veterans, including the use of global positioning system (GPS) location and ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) to improve understanding of context, mobility, and distance to services. These methods
can change how health services researchers think about collecting data from marginalized and hidden
populations. These techniques can identify sequences of micro-temporal events, for example teasing apart the
events and experiences that immediately precede (and follow) the transition from one housing type to the next,
or the events that led to a missed healthcare opportunity (e.g. a missed appointment).
Specific Aims: This study assesses the feasibility of smartphone data collection from homeless Veterans.
Aim 1: Characterize the real-time lived experience of homeless Veterans, including day-to-day activities,
interactions with services, and residential transitions using a formative ethnographic approach;
Aim 2: Refine and tailor smartphone data collection methods;
Aim 3: Conduct a 4-week demonstration of smartphone data collection to evaluate its acceptability and
feasibility with Veterans experiencing homelessness. Integrate quantitative (GPS, EMA, mobile survey,
medical records) and qualitative data; identify distinct patterns (or typologies) of residential transitions; and,
assess associations among residential transitions, mobility, mood, health services, and adherence.
Methodology: Ethnographic interview methods are used in Aim 1; focus groups and usability assessments in
Aim 2; and smartphone data collection in Aim 3.
Next Steps/Implementation: Using the methods and findings from this study, next steps will be to develop
interventions to identify and intervene at timepoints when there is rapid deterioration in Veterans' housing
stability or health to prevent major housing disruptions and health crises. Interventions will also contribute to
enhancing access to care and adherence to treatments."
10811743,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Drug-use and addiction are complex social and medical issues and many strategies are being employed
to decrease the detrimental effects of opioid addiction. The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic.
The first-line treatment for opioid overdose is the opioid antagonist, naloxone, which competes for binding to
the orthosteric site of µ-opioid receptors (MOR). Unfortunately, naloxone exhibits decreased effectiveness in
cases of overdose involving potent synthetic opioids, often requiring repeated administration. This study seeks
to identify novel counter-measures for synthetic opioids, with an emphasis on fentanyl.
 This project will identify novel agents which reverse the effects of fentanyl. We will utilize larval zebrafish
as an in vivo high-throughput competitive environment to measure the ability of substances to counter-act the
effects of synthetic opioids. The zebrafish paradigm also models drug uptake and biodistribution, which are
recognized as being important contributors to the clinical interactions between opioids and naloxone.
 Commercially available screening libraries will be filtered to define a library of thousands of compounds
with physiochemical properties which forecast CNS drug-likeness. In Aim 1, this library will be procured and
tested for ability to reverse the effects of fentanyl in a novel photomotor response (PMR) assay we have
developed. Preliminary data within the application provides high confidence that we will be able to use this
PMR assay to successfully identify novel chemical classes which work via conventional competitive orthosteric
inhibition of the MOR to reverse the effects of synthetic opioids. This is a likely outcome which is valuable in
its own right and relatively low risk. The high-risk/high-reward prospect of this work is the potential identification
of novel chemical classes which work via non-MOR mechanisms to reverse overdose from synthetic opioids.
This is a unique advantage of the PMR phenotypic screen, which provides the opportunity to identify agents
working via non-MOR mechanism- an outcome which target-based approaches cannot provide. Hit
compounds capable of reversing the effects of fentanyl in an equivalent, or improved, fashion relative to
naloxone will be studied in a follow-up confirmatory assay (Aim 2) focusing on ability to rescue fentanyl induced
depression of cardiovascular function in zebrafish.
 Upon completion, this screening campaign will deliver novel small molecules capable of reversing the
effects of synthetic opioids. Such molecules are anticipated to work as: 1) novel MOR allosteric modulators,
2) novel MOR orthosteric antagonists, and/or 3) novel agents acting via a non-MOR mechanism. Successful
compounds will have favorable physiochemical properties as potential CNS agents and have demonstrated
in vivo efficacy, which presumably dictates adequate CNS exposure and BBB penetration. As such, the ‘hits’
delivered from this project will serve as excellent starting points for future hit-to-lead optimization campaigns."
10814221,"We propose a randomized, controlled trial of a video- and telephone-based, brief insomnia treatment in
Veterans who meet criteria for Insomnia Disorder and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) to accomplish the
goal of improving psychosocial functioning. The primary outcome for the trial will be psychosocial functioning,
with insomnia severity serving as the secondary outcome. Additional goals include assessing durability of
treatment gains and evaluating whether suicidal ideation decreases after insomnia treatment.
 Eighty Veterans with Insomnia Disorder and PTSD will be randomly assigned to either Brief Behavioral
Treatment for Insomnia (BBTI; one 60-minute and one 30-minute video encounter, and two 20-minute phone-
based encounters) or a Progressive Muscle Relaxation Training control group (manualized relaxation training
delivered by two video and two phone sessions, matched to the BBTI condition for therapist time). Prior to
randomization, participants will complete clinician-administered, mental health diagnostic interviews at baseline
(and post-treatment). Self-report measures of psychosocial functioning, insomnia severity, and other mental
health symptoms will be completed at baseline (pre-treatment), mid-treatment, post-treatment, and at 6-month
follow-up (BBTI treatment group only). Sleep parameters will be completed with a self-report sleep diary. One
week of sleep parameters data will be collected at baseline and continuously to the post-treatment
appointment (and at 6-month follow-up for the BBTI treatment group only).
 We also will explore whether participation in BBTI helps to decrease suicidal ideation, which often
occurs in Veterans with PTSD and insomnia. Information on suicidal ideation will be collected through the
Depressive Symptom Index: Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS) and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
(C-SSRS), the latter which is used clinically in the VA to assess suicide risk. We will allow Veterans with
current suicidal ideation into the study but will exclude Veterans with current suicidal intent or a plan. Veterans
who have suicidal ideation, but no intent or plan will be assessed at baseline, mid-treatment, and post-
treatment and will be clinically monitored if any risk issues should emerge during treatment. This trial will
provide useful information regarding rehabilitative outcomes, and it will yield specific information that will allow
us to better understand whether a brief behavioral insomnia treatment can assist with suicidal ideation, a highly
concerning issue among Veterans."
10834188,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A diverse group of autosomal-dominant mutations that cause human blindness as a result of rod and cone
degeneration includes multiple mutations in two genes, GUCY2D coding for retinal guanylyl cyclase 1
(RetGC1) and GUCA1A coding for guanylyl cyclase activating protein 1 (GCAP1). These mutations explicitly
trigger photoreceptor death via a common mechanism – by abnormally elevating cyclic GMP production in the
dark. Although the biochemical origin of the dominant GUCY2D and GUCA1A retinopathies became better
understood over the past decade, potential approaches to their therapy, such as using gene editing or RNA
interference to suppress particular alleles causing the disease, continue to present a major conceptual
challenge. This proposal, conforming to the NEI mission to support research with respect to blinding eye
diseases, visual disorders and mechanisms of visual function, explores the foundation of a new approach for
the prospective therapy – targeting the common biochemical pathway underlying GUCY2D and GUCA1A
dominant retinopathies. The proposal is built on the following main findings: (i) understanding that deregulation
of RetGC1 activity is the key to the photoreceptor death caused by the gain-of-function mutations in GUCY2D
and GUCA1A; (ii) development of mouse genetic models for studying the biochemical and physiological
mechanisms of degeneration incited by the mutant RetGC1 and GCAP1; (iii) recent findings that the abnormal
increase in cGMP production that leads to photoreceptor death can be effectively opposed by three different
biochemical processes, such as acceleration of cGMP decay in the dark by recombinant phosphodiesterase 5
(PDE5r), stemming RetGC1 activation by GCAP1 using a newly designed protein inhibitor of guanylyl cyclase
(PIGC), and enhancing protection of photoreceptors against the presence of deregulated RetGC1 using retinal
degeneration-3 (RD3) protein. The research plan of this proposal pursues three Specific Aims, each
addressing a new original concept designed to avert photoreceptor dystrophy caused by deregulation of
RetGC1. Specific Aim 1 explores the biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying rescue of
photoreceptors in mouse models harboring the degenerative mutants of RetGC1 and GCAP1 using ectopic
expression of PDE5r. Aim 2 explores mechanisms of their rescue using PIGC. Aim 3 explores the mechanisms
supporting the survival of photoreceptors using RD3. We reason that achieving these Specific Aims will help in
developing approaches to the future therapy of the dominant GUCY2D and GUCA1A retinopathies."
10851975,"Project Abstract
Our laboratory has used the phototransduction pathway in retinal rods, a beautifully designed sensory response
system, to study how G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) propagate highly amplified signals. This pathway
starts with the absorption of a photon by the GPCR rhodopsin, resulting in its activation of the heterotrimeric G
protein transducin by catalyzing GDP-GTP exchange on the transducin-alpha subunit (GT). GTP-bound GT
subunits then interact with their effector protein, the cyclic GMP (cGMP) phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6), a
tetrameric enzyme with two catalytic subunits (PDE, PDE) and two subunits (PDE) that bind GT. Binding of
GTP-bound GT subunits to PDE6 activates its ability to hydrolyze cGMP to GMP, thus closing cGMP-gated ion
channels in retinal rod membranes and sending a signal to the optic nerve. We determined structures for the
rhodopsin-transducin complex by cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), which together with efforts from other
laboratories, led to a detailed picture of how GPCRs activate their G protein partners. However, there is still a
great deal to learn about how activated G proteins execute a precise regulation of their effector proteins.
Recently, we solved a cryoEM structure for a complex in solution that contains two GTP-bound GT subunits
and PDE6, leading to a model describing how transducin activates its biological effector. We will now test
important aspects of this model through two broad experimental aims, each comprised of a number of sub-aims:
1) Determine how activated G subunits of the retinal G protein transducin exert a highly tuned
regulation of their biological effector PDE6. We will perform: (i) fluorescence read-outs we developed to
monitor GT-PDE6 interactions, (ii) studies with a bivalent GT antibody that enables us to form different
asymmetric configurations of GT-PDE6 complexes and (iii) site-directed spin probe labeling with electron spin
resonance spectroscopy, to test our model for how two GT subunits activate PDE6, as well as (iv) determine if
the model is consistent with how RGS9 deactivates signal propagation. 2) Establish a mechanistic basis for
how a membrane environment influences the ability of the retinal G protein to activate its biological
effector. We will use: (i) fluorescence read-outs to monitor GT-PDE6 interactions to determine how membranes
facilitate PDE6 activation by GT, and (ii) FRET to examine the orientation of the PDE subunits on PDE6 in the
presence and absence of GTP-bound GT in a membrane environment. We will also: (iii) reconstitute GT-
stimulated PDE6 activity in nanodiscs, and (iv) undertake structure determinations of PDE6 alone and bound to
GT, to test our model for PDE6 activation in a more physiological setting. The results of these studies will
enable us to further develop a comprehensive mechanistic picture for how an activated G protein regulates its
biological effector in phototransduction, and how this signal is rapidly terminated when its stimulation has ceased,
as well as provide fundamentally important insights into key steps essential for other GPCR-sensory responses."

Recent advances in targeted therapies have revolutionized lung cancer clinical practice. Lung adenocarcinomas
harbor frequent mutations/amplifications/fusions in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and RAS pathway
oncogenes, many of which can be targeted by FDA-approved therapies. However, the majority of patients do
not have targeted treatment options. Our previous work identified somatic RIT1 mutations in lung
adenocarcinomas and discovered that RIT1 variants act as gain-of-function mutations to promote cellular
transformation and drug resistance. RIT1 amplification and overexpression may play a similar pathogenic role.
RIT1 mutations also are found in myeloid leukemias and in the germline of individuals with Noonan Syndrome.
In all diseases, mutations in RIT1 are mutually exclusive with other RAS-pathway mutations, implicating RIT1 as
a RAS-pathway driver gene. However, our recent preliminary data show that RIT1 and KRAS substantially differ
in the downstream effectors needed to promote tumorigenesis. Further understanding the cellular consequences
of RIT1 mutations will open up new strategies for treatment of RIT1-mutant cancers.
In this proposal, we define the mechanism of action of RIT1 mutations in lung cancer and test the efficacy of two
new treatment strategies. Building on our preliminary studies that constitute the first global profiling of RIT1
function, we now will: (1) Identify the mechanism of RIT1-YAP1 synergy in lung cancer, (2) Determine how a
USP9X-RIT1 axis regulates the spindle assembly checkpoint and sensitivity to anti-mitotic therapies, and (3)
Define the therapeutic potential of anti-YAP1/TEAD and anti-mitotic therapies in RIT1-mutant lung cancer.
Ultimately, this work will advance our understanding of the role and mechanism of RIT1 mutations in cancer and
contribute the rationale and pre-clinical data needed to translate these findings into new clinical trials. Our access
to novel patient-derived and genetically-engineered mouse models, coupled with our expertise in both functional
genomics and pre-clinical studies, make our laboratory uniquely well-suited to discover new therapeutic options
and improve outcomes for patients with RIT1-mutant cancers."
10829468,"Project Summary
The overarching goal of our research is to understand the mechanisms of helicases and polymerases in
processes such as viral RNA recognition, DNA transcription, and replication. The unifying approach is the
quantitative characterization of the enzymatic reactions using rigorous biochemical and biophysical methods
such as transient state kinetics, single-molecule kinetics, computational kinetic modeling, and cryo-electron
microscopy. The integration of structural and functional studies allows the development of a complete
mechanistic picture. In project 1, we are studying viral RNA recognition by RIG-I like receptors which are
helicases serving as the first responders of viral RNA infections. The RIG-I like receptors recognize pathogen-
associated molecular patterns on viral genomes and replication intermediates and respond by triggering an
immune response to create an antiviral state. Our research focuses on understanding the mechanisms of RNA
recognition and ATPase/helicase functions of RIG-I like receptors using biochemical, structural, and cell-
signaling assays. We are elucidating the intrinsic mechanisms in RIG-I that enable self versus non-self
recognition and developing new strategies to understand how they are activated and regulated. In project 2,
we are studying the mechanism and regulation of mitochondrial DNA transcription catalyzed by RNA
polymerases that resemble phage T7 but regulated by transcription factors. Transcription initiation and
transition into elongation are key stages that are regulated by transcription factors. We are using cryo-electron
microscopy, and ensemble/single-molecule kinetics to elucidate the structure and dynamics at these stages of
transcription using in vitro reconstituted yeast and human mitochondrial RNA polymerases. In project 3, we
are studying the mechanism of DNA replication by phage T7 and human mitochondrial replisomes. We study
how helicase and polymerase work together to catalyze strand-displacement DNA synthesis, in particular, how
they are energetically coupled. We are studying the mechanism of DNA synthesis by mitochondrial DNA
polymerase to understand the role of helicase, Twinkle, and mitochondrial single-strand binding protein. An in-
depth understanding of the enzymatic mechanisms is critically necessary to understand mitochondrial DNA
deletions caused by defects in helicase and polymerase. This research will provide the mechanistic framework
to quantitatively model the reactions of replication, transcription, and pathogen recognition that will guide in the
development of therapies for viral infections, cancer, mitochondrial diseases."
10849858,"The role of reactive nitrogen species in over eighty human diseases including atherosclerosis, cancer,
neurodegeneration, and stroke is well demonstrated by the accumulation of the biomarker 3-nitrotyrosine
(nitroTyr). NitroTyr is not randomly distributed across the proteome as might be expected, but rather is found on
specific tyrosines on specific proteins. In response to these observations, the PI has greatly advanced this field
by developing genetic code expansion (GCE) technologies enabling site-specific incorporation of nitroTyr into
recombinant proteins in bacteria and mammalian cells. Collaborative work using these tools has now firmly
established that nitroTyr-proteins are causative agents in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, atherosclerosis, and
cancer, supporting our central hypothesis that nitroTyr-modified proteins are key players in human disease and
that understanding the basis for their accumulation and removal, as well as their mechanistic roles in pathology
will lead to new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Further support comes from the breakthrough
discovery of a denitrase enzyme that is a tumor suppressor: the “D2” pseudo-phosphatase domain of the protein
tyrosine phosphatase receptor T (PTPRTD2) is a tyrosine denitrase that when knocked out promotes cancer
growth. This upends the paradigm that nitroTyr-proteins are an unregulated by-product of stress and makes
possible a new research strategy that should accelerate progress. Instead of identifying specific diseases and
associated nitroTyr modified proteins one at a time, under the hypothesis that this denitrase represents a new
enzyme family involved in regulating the impact of nitroTyr, characterizing these denitrases and the breadth of
their substrates should speed the identification of physiologically relevant nitroTyr modifications and also provide
new avenues to define their impact. This will be done through pursuing two aims that encompass: (1) defining
the denitrase substrate scope and the structure-function relationships critical for substrate recognition, and (2)
converting denitrases and their substrates into traps and inhibitors which will be used to identify
denitrase/substrate pairs and aid studies of their physiological/pathological impacts in cells. Preliminary work
demonstrating feasibility has already identified two additional denitrase substrates, which have altered function
upon site-specific nitration. The proposed work to define what nitroTyr proteins are substrates of denitrases will
also help resolve why nitrated proteins accumulate in disease, and for every case in which it is discovered that
a denitrase/nitroTyr-substrate pair contribute to pathology development, the mapping of that process will open
up a new avenue for therapeutic intervention. As (i) the developer of existing nitroTyr GCE technologies, (ii) an
enzymologist and (iii) acting director of the Unnatural Protein Facility, the PI is superbly qualified to lead this work
and all needed facilities are available. Furthermore, key collaborators are already engaged who bring the
expertise in structural biology and cell biology needed for the breadth of work proposed."

Addressing Surgical Disparities at the Root: Improving Diversity in the Surgical Workforce
The recent COVID-19 pandemic, racially motivated murders, and subsequent protests underscore what we
already know--that racial disparities in medicine run far deeper than patient outcomes alone and must be
addressed at all levels. Racial and gender disparities in surgical outcomes and satisfaction are well documented.
From a pipeline perspective, surgery struggles to maintain and promote underrepresented minority (UIM) and
women residents and faculty. Efforts to improve diversity in the workforce overtime have not kept pace with the
increased diversity in our patient populations. There is evidence that improving diversity in the surgical workforce
can improve the quality and outcomes of care for UIM and women patients. The proposed study involves a team
of interdisciplinary investigators with complimentary expertise and a strong record of research in the topic area
collaborating with multiple stakeholder societies. Our objective is to reduce disparities in surgical care using a
novel, transdisciplinary, multi-institutional deviance approach to characterize disparities in the surgical workforce,
set best practice guidelines, and develop a pilot intervention. Our central hypothesis is that by using deviance
methodology we can identify best practices in retention and promotion of women and minority faculty and
trainees in surgery that can be used to help increase diversity in the work force and ultimately patient quality of
care. We will perform a secondary data analysis to measure diversity among surgical faculty across the U.S.;
identify programs with the best and worst records of promotion and retention of UIM and women faculty; and
document the range of promotion and retention among these groups at academic medical centers to identify
predictors of successful diversity efforts Using AAMC data combined with ABS data and qualifying as well as
certifying examination data, we will describe the sociodemographic profile of surgical trainees and current
attrition rates for surgical residents in the U.S., identifying those programs with the best and worst records of
graduating residents. We will utilize data on cultural competency and bias assessment surveys collected from
our target programs as well as focus groups with the National Medical Association, the Association of Women
Surgeons and the Historically Black Medical Colleges and Universities and in-depth, qualitative interviews with
program administrators, UIM and women trainees, faculty, and department and division heads at programs that
have been successful - or struggled at - retaining and promoting UIM and women faculty to study best and worst
practices and organizational characteristics. Finally, we will take predictors from our quantitative analysis,
themes from our qualitative analysis, and coordinate a Delphi panel of academic leaders and patient advocacy
groups to create a set of best practice guidelines and develop a pilot study to test at poorly performing programs.
By defining best practices for retention and promotion of residents and faculty, we can develop best practices
and test these to help improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the academic surgical workforce."
10761755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Residual subpopulations of antibiotic-susceptible bacteria can remain within host tissues following
antibiotic treatment. These surviving bacteria are called persister cells, which are transiently tolerant to high
levels of antibiotic, and can cause serious relapsing infection after treatment. Critically, current treatment
strategies do not target persisters. To fully eradicate all bacterial cells, treatments are prolonged, increasing
patient and clinical costs. Prolonged antibiotic exposure can promote antibiotic resistance, further emphasizing
the need to improve treatment efficacy. Improved treatment strategies would simultaneously target all
members of the bacterial population, including persisters. However, persisters have been primarily studied in
culture, and relevant persister cell-specific drug targets within host tissues are largely undefined. Bacteria
behave very differently in host tissues, where nutrient limitation and antimicrobial host defenses activate strong
stress response pathways in bacterial pathogens. We predict persisters utilize distinct, potentially novel,
survival strategies within the host environment.
 To study bacterial antibiotic persistence within host tissues, we established a mouse model of
doxycycline treatment of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis splenic deep tissue infection. Doxycycline is an effective
treatment for human Yersinia infection, but requires 7 days continuous treatment, which has been incorporated
into our mouse model. Prior to antibiotic treatment, Y. pseudotuberculosis replicate to form clusters of
extracellular bacteria that directly interface with a layer of neutrophils that are, in turn, enveloped by a layer of
monocytes. In the initial 4h of doxycycline treatment, we observe a significant decrease in viable bacterial
numbers, which correlates with a wave of neutrophil infiltration into the spleen. However, a residual bacterial
subpopulation (~10%) remain in the spleen throughout the 7-day treatment. Bacterial cells resume growth and
cause lethality when antibiotic concentrations wane, defining these cells as persisters.
 We hypothesize that interactions with neutrophils and monocytes predispose persisters to
survive antibiotic treatment, and prolonged antibiotic exposure promotes additional transcriptional
and genetic changes within persister cells. Utilizing our fluorescent reporter system to detect viable,
doxycycline-exposed bacteria within the mouse spleen, we will: 1) identify the transcriptional, proteomic, and
genetic changes specific to surviving bacteria within antibiotic-treated mice, 2) determine whether specific
bacterial targets are critical for antibiotic persistence in the host, and 3) determine if monocyte or neutrophil
interactions promote antibiotic persistence. We hypothesize activated neutrophils initially reduce the bacterial
burden, and we will determine if evasion of neutrophil-mediated killing promotes persister cell survival.
Identifying persister cell survival strategies within host tissues will provide critical information to advance the
field and enable the development of more efficacious therapeutic strategies against bacterial infections."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a result of T-cell mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells in the pancreatic
islets. Autoreactive CD8 T cells are required in this “mistaken” immune response but how they drive disease is
ill-defined. There are two key time points during the life of autoreactive T cells closely related to disease,
namely, their creation in the thymus and activation in the periphery. The former fails to eliminate the potentially
pathogenic T cells whereas the latter allows them to travel to and stay in the target tissue to mediate damage.
Both events are strictly dependent on recognition of beta-cell self-antigens. However, little is known about how
diabetogenic CD8 T cells recognize beta-cell antigens. We have over the years studied T cell antigen
recognition using novel ultrasensitive two-dimensional (2D) force-based methods, showing 2D TCR affinity and
bond lifetime with peptide:MHC as two main kinetics parameters that dictate thymocyte selection outcome and
T cell effector functions. The current project aims to use these 2D methods to define binding kinetics of beta-
cell antigen recognition by diabetogenic CD8 T cells in the context of their thymic development, peripheral
effector function, and T1D pathogenesis. Our preliminary data show that CD8 T cells form weak bonds with
beta-cell antigens during thymocyte selection but increase bond strength upon activation. Such change of self-
reactivity is mediated by coreceptor CD8. In contrast, the same parameters did not change for foreign antigen
recognition. These data support our central hypothesis that, in autoimmune diabetes, CD8 fundamentally alters
self-antigen recognition through modulation of TCR binding kinetics, thereby endowing CD8 T cells with
heightened self-reactivity that overcomes self-tolerance to mediate beta-cell destruction. We propose two
specific aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim1, we will define 2D affinity and bond lifetime of beta-cell antigen
recognition by CD8 T cells. We hypothesize that diabetogenic CD8 T cells, even at a single clonal level, are
highly adaptive in antigen recognition such that they use weak binding kinetics to survive central and peripheral
tolerance but greatly increase self-reactivity to precipitate disease. We will use a panel of monoclonal
diabetogenic TCR cell clones based on the NOD mouse model of T1D to systemically characterize beta-cell
antigen recognition during diabetogenic CD8 T cell thymocyte selection and peripheral activation and
investigate a causal relationship between plasticity of beta-cell antigen recognition and autoimmune diabetes.
In Aim2, we will elucidate the underlying mechanisms of beta-cell antigen recognition. We hypothesize that
plasticity of beta-cell antigen recognition by diabetogenic CD8 T cells is due to CD8 binding kinetics with MHC.
We will first define the role of CD8 in the overall beta-cell antigen recognition. We will then test a sub-
hypothesis that unique patterns of CD8 glycosylation determine adaptability of CD8 binding kinetics by T cell
glycan profiling, phenotyping, and single cell transcriptomic analysis."

Over the last two decades, breakthroughs in sequencing technologies have revealed that mammalian genomes
encode thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The numbers of human lncRNAs that are known to be
dysregulated in diseases are rising at a rapid pace. Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs are critical
regulators of fundamental cellular processes and disease progression. Despite their significance as potential
biomarkers and therapeutic targets, the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs remain poorly understood. The
primary goal of this research is to elucidate in greater detail the mechanisms by which lncRNAs activate
transcription. Many lncRNAs are associated with epigenetic machinery; these include histone-modifying
complexes, such as the polycomb repressive complex 2, and nucleosome remodeling complexes, such as the
SWI/SNF (SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable) complex. While the RNA-PRC2 interactions are under active
investigation, the role of lncRNAs in nucleosome remodeling remains uncharacterized. Here, we seek to
understand the function of lncRNAs in SWI/SNF-based gene activation. The SWI/SNF complex is a known tumor
suppressor, and its subunits are mutated in various cancers. Recently, lncRNAs have been shown to interact
with the SWI/SNF complex in mammals and plants. In this proposal, we will utilize lncTCF7 to investigate the
role of lncRNAs in SWI/SNF-based gene activation. Previous studies have shown that lncTCF7 activates Wnt
signaling by recruiting the SWI/SNF complex. However, the biochemical and structural basis of these interactions
is not established. In preliminary studies, we identified SND1 (Staphylococcal Nuclease and Tudor Domain
Containing 1) as the top interaction partner of lncTCF7. SND1 is a transcriptional coactivator, and it is known to
associate with the SWI/SNF family. Here, we propose a novel mechanism suggesting that lncTCF7 recruits the
SWI/SNF complex indirectly via its interaction with SND1. Further, our RNA chemical probing studies identified
structural domains and regions of lncTCF7 conserved across mammalian genomes. We hypothesize that these
conserved regions and structured elements play critical roles in recruiting protein partners and activating
transcription at specific loci. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: In Aim 1, we will define the
functional role of lncTCF7’s domains. Aim 2 will determine the role of lncTCF7-SND1 interaction in recruiting the
SWI/SNF complex and activating transcription. In Aim 3, we will determine the 3D structure of lncTCF7 and the
lncTCF7-SND1 complex. Together, these studies will provide biochemical and structural knowledge of lncTCF7’s
molecular function and expand our understanding of how lncRNAs regulate gene transcription and contribute to
disease states."
10889182,"Over 34 million Americans (~10% of population) have diabetes, 90-95% of which is type 2
diabetes (T2D). T2D is a leading cause of health complications in the US, and minority
populations with diabetes are more likely to experience microvascular complications,
macrovascular disease, and subsequent death than their White counterparts even when access
to care is comparable. The pathophysiology of hyperglycemic organ damage, and why some
patients are relatively spared, remains largely unknown. Aggressive glycemic control is known
to decrease the frequency of diabetic complications, particularly microvascular, however, few
patients are able reach recommended glycemic targets. Inherited variation is known to
contribute to the risk of T2D complications. However, genetic associations studies of diabetic
complications have only recently begun to reveal the specific genes and pathways responsible
for increased susceptibility. While these findings show the promise of this approach, there is an
urgent need to better understand the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia leads to organ
damage and increase genetic discoveries in diabetic complications. To achieve this goal, we
hypothesize that genetics can further enhance the biological insights into diabetic complications
by using large-scale sample size, consideration of pleiotropy, environmental modulation and
genetic subtyping. The following Specific Aims are proposed to test this hypothesis 1) Genomic
and pleiotropy analyses of diabetic complications in 185K subjects with T2D across five racial-
ethnic groups; 2) Gene x environment (GxE) interaction analyses of diabetic complications to
consider the role of environmental modulation on genetic risk T2D complications in up to 1.3M
subjects with and without T2D; and 3) genetic risk profiles and causal inference in diabetic
complications to identify causal risk factors and disentangle the relationship between the factors
and T2D and its complications. This work has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms of
diabetic complications and provide insights into biology and knowledge critical to guide the
development of potential clinical predictors, strategies for prevention and guide development of
new therapies."
10874583,"The spatial specificity, temporal dynamics, and context dependence of neuromodulator-induced intracellular
signals are essential to explain neuromodulator function. However, although the identity of many signaling
molecules downstream of neuromodulator receptors are known, the nature and functions of these features are
poorly understood. The long-term goal is to uncover the cellular and subcellular specificity, the temporal
dynamics, and the context-dependence of neuromodulator-induced intracellular signals. The overall objective
here is to determine the features and synaptic functions of acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated protein kinase A
(PKA) activity in the hippocampus. The central hypothesis is that ACh regulates PKA with spatial, temporal,
and context-dependent specificity that is essential to synaptic plasticity. The rationale for this project came
from multiples lines of evidence. First, Gαq-coupled muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChRs) elevate PKA activity.
Second, PKA activity demonstrates rich spatial, temporal, and context-dependent features. Third, perturbations
of the spread and duration of PKA activity alter cellular and behavior functions, illustrating the importance of its
spatiotemporal dynamics. Finally, mAChRs and PKA are both powerful regulators of synaptic plasticity. The
central hypothesis will be tested in both acute hippocampal slices and head-fixed mice, with three specific aims
to determine the subcellular compartments (Aim 1), the temporal dynamics (Aim 2), and the context-
dependence (Aim 3) of PKA activation by ACh and the roles of these features for synaptic plasticity. To
determine the features of mAChR-mediated PKA activity, optogenetics will be used to induce ACh release, and
ACh level and PKA activity will be measured with novel biosensors and two-photon fluorescence lifetime
imaging microscopy (2pFLIM). To determine the contribution of these features to synaptic plasticity, subcellular
compartment-targeted, light-activated actuators will be used to perturb PKA activity with spatial and temporal
precision, and electrophysiology will be used to measure synaptic transmission. The proposed research is
innovative because conceptually, it goes beyond the identity of molecules to revealing their actions, goes
beyond static snapshots to revealing signaling dynamics, and goes beyond knowing the involvement of a
signal to revealing their contributions. Methodologically, the research employs cutting-edge technology to
induce neuromodulator release, and to measure and perturb intracellular signals with spatial and temporal
precision – these approaches will find widespread application in cellular signaling beyond neuromodulator
research. The proposed research is significant because it will offer explanatory power on how features, and not
just identity of intracellular signals, shape cellular physiology and behavior. These results will reveal new
principles of neuromodulator action, and provide insights into how molecular mechanisms general behaviorally
relevant features. In the long run, these results will help design better therapies that target the relevant features
in neurological and psychiatric disorders."

Accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division is one of the most fundamental requirements in
biology. Without proper chromosomal segregation, genetic information cannot be faithfully transmitted across
cell and organismal generations, leading to severe consequences including cell death, developmental defects,
or progression of cancer. Furthermore, improper chromosome segregation in cancer cells has been shown to
lead to anti-tumor inflammatory responses. Central to the process of chromosome segregation is the centromere,
the chromosomal locus at which spindle microtubules bind. The centromere is defined epigenetically by the
presence of nucleosomes containing the histone variant CENP-A. Centromeric chromatin serves as the
foundation of the kinetochore, a large protein complex which assembles on CENP-A nucleosomes and mediates
microtubule binding. Research into the centromere is necessary to better understand the processes that underlie
chromosome segregation in both health and disease, but our understanding of the human centromere remains
largely incomplete. This proposal aims to answer fundamental questions about the structure and function of the
centromere and its associated proteins. Recent advances in reconstitution of large centromeric protein
complexes have increased our understanding of the structure of the human kinetochore, but reconstituted
complexes can only approximate in vivo structures, and currently there are multiple competing models for the
structure and organization of the centromere and kinetochore. The emerging technology of cryo-electron
tomography (cryo-ET) provides the opportunity to interrogate the structure of the centromere and kinetochore in
their native context within vitreous hydrated cells. To this end, in Aim 1 cryo-ET will be used to obtain the first in
situ structures of the human centromere and kinetochore in the interphase and mitosis stages of the cell cycle.
The second focus of this proposal is to elucidate the interactions among centromeric proteins that are required
for the essential functions of the centromere, including formation of microtubule attachments and maintenance
of centromeric identity. Two kinetochore proteins, Ndc80 and CENP-Q, have both been shown to contribute to
microtubule binding in vitro and in vivo, but their respective roles in microtubule binding in vivo have not been
fully characterized. Multiple proteins within the constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) have
similarly been shown to contribute to maintenance and deposition of CENP-A at the centromere, but the CCAN
contains multiple interconnected subcomplexes whose contributions have never been systematically tested. In
Aim 2 mutagenesis of the respective endogenous gene loci (and rapid depletion of the respective wild type gene
products) will be used to elucidate in vivo and with temporal accuracy the interactions that underlie spindle
attachment and maintenance of centromeric identity. These experiments will provide important insights into the
structure and function of the human centromere and kinetochore which are essential for proper chromosome
segregation and genomic fidelity across generations."
10880288,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Cancer drug resistance occurs not only by selection of genetically resistant clones, but also through phenotypic
plasticity via rapid induction of transcriptional programs that allow some cells to adapt and persist. In bladder
cancer (BC), phenotypic plasticity is observed in a model established in our lab, in which two subpopulations of
tumor cells reversibly and spontaneously transition from one to the other. Isolated and studied by Hoechst
staining and flow cytometry, these subpopulations consist of a “side population” (SP) of highly tumorigenic,
cisplatin-resistant, stem-like cells, and a “non-side population” (NSP) of cells lacking these properties. A potential
contributing epigenetic factor to this plasticity is N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification. Deposited by m6A
writers and removed by m6A erasers, m6A dynamically and reversibly regulates key cellular functions and
essential features of cancer cells. Deregulation of m6A modifications and m6A effectors (writers, erasers, readers)
has been implicated in drug resistance in various cancer types. To study the role of m6A modifications in BC, I
set up and validated in our lab the gold standard epitranscriptomic assay, methyl-RNA-immunoprecipitation
followed by high-throughput sequencing (MeRIP-seq). I used this assay to compare the SP and NSP
subpopulations and identified differentially methylated candidate transcripts. I also found that pharmacological
inhibition of a key m6A eraser, fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), potentiates a shift to the SP state.
Based on these preliminary data, I propose to test the hypothesis that m6A modifications regulate expression of
transcripts that promote transition to a drug-resistant state in BC in vitro and in patient-derived samples. I will
accomplish this with the following aims: Aim 1: I will use MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq to systematically identify
differentially methylated and differentially expressed transcripts that drive the shift to and from a drug-resistant
state. I will genetically modulate these targets, and measure the impact on cisplatin resistance, SP-NSP
interconversion, colony formation, migration and invasiveness. Aim 2: I will define the function of FTO, a key m6A
eraser that affects plasticity in our model by genetically and pharmacologically modulating FTO. I will measure
the impact on cisplatin resistance, SP-NSP interconversion, colony formation, migration and invasiveness, and
use MeRIP-seq and RNA-seq to identify transcripts that are both differentially methylated and differentially
expressed. Aim 3: I will use RT-qPCR to test which candidate transcripts and m6A effectors are associated with
clinical progression to cisplatin resistance using BC patient-derived solid and liquid biopsy samples.
Characterizing this novel epitranscriptomic mechanism will provide strong evidence for new biomarkers and
therapeutic targets aimed at short-circuiting BC drug resistance. The proposed research study will offer rigorous
physician-scientist training in an outstanding environment offering top notch research facilities integrated with
translational patient tissue resources and diverse mentoring expertise."
10854901,"Abstract for Metalloprotein Mechanisms of Redox Regulation and Catalysis
This proposal covers the three R01 grants funding my laboratory and aims to fill gaps in understanding the
mechanisms of crucial aspects of redox regulation and catalysis by metalloproteins from microbes to humans.
Successful completion of this work will reveal novel mechanisms with broad significance to human health, the
environment, and biotechnology. Our research integrates a wide variety of biological, biophysical, biochemical
and computational approaches. In Project Area 1, we will extend recent discoveries of novel bioinorganic and
enzymatic mechanisms of anaerobic microbial CO and CO2 fixation in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP),
proposed to have fueled the origin of live on earth. We will reveal the mechanisms of these ancient enzymes:
their generation and use of CO as a substrate, formation of bioorganometallic catalytic intermediates, utilization
of nucleophilic and paramagnetic metal centers as catalysts, requirement of large domain movements and an
interprotein CO channel and recently identified alcove for CO binding and CO2 fixation. We will define how
these unique features choreograph redox activation, substrate and partner protein binding, leading to biological
transformation that chemists are trying to mimic to more rapidly and efficiently accomplish chemically
challenging reactions, e.g., to sequester, activate and convert CO2, methane and syngas into industrially
important chemical feedstocks and fuels. While I started my career studying the WLP, I have applied the same
expertise to other important evolving problems of metabolic regulation in humans by CO and metals and of
mercury toxicity. In Project Area 2, we propose to deliver important discoveries on how human metabolism,
metal homeostasis and the circadian clock are regulated by heme regulatory motifs (HRMs), signaling
molecules (CO and NO), and cellular heme levels and redox poise. Focusing on heme oxygenase-2 (HO2), we
will explore crucial conformational changes between the core and tail of HO2 and how these movements
control protein turnover, protein-protein interactions, and heme conversion to CO, biliverdin and Fe. We will
explore the hypothesis that HO2 serves a dual function in the cell in controlling heme trafficking and turnover.
We will monitor the dynamics and interactions of full length HO2 with its redox partner cytochrome P450
reductase and with its heme donor GAPDH and define mechanisms that regulate heme-controlled HO2
turnover. Following up on our finding that the nuclear receptor Rev-Erbb uses a novel mechanism of redox-
chemical coupling to serve as a CO/NO sensor, we will address how redox and gas binding affect its structure,
function, activity and its interactions with partners like NCoR1 and its heme chaperone. In Project Area 3,
recent successes in purifying and crystallizing the active HgcAB complex and defining its unusual thiolate-
coordinated B12 cofactor, enable our proposed studies of the mechanism of microbial mercury methylation. We
will determine the HgcAB structure, the redox and ligation states of the metal centers during catalysis, and
whether a methyl radical or anion is used by these B12 and iron-sulfur clusters during catalysis."

Combining fasting with chemotherapy can cause complete tumor regression in animal models. Acute fasting is
thought to sensitize tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy and radiation, while protecting healthy
cells by increasing stress resistance—a phenomenon known as the Differential Stress Sensitization theory.
However, the potential risks of extended caloric restriction hamper clinical implementation. Time-restricted eating
(TRE) is a promising alternative, which involves eating within a period of 10 hours or less, followed by fasting for
at least 14 hours daily. Because of its simplicity, TRE may be more sustainable. Moreover, our pilot data suggest
that TRE has several anti-cancer effects: it decreases IGF-1 levels, reduces oxidative stress, upregulates
antioxidant defenses, and enhances autophagy. We propose to conduct the first clinical trial of TRE in cancer
patients undergoing active treatment, as well as the largest randomized controlled trial of any form of intermittent
fasting in cancer patients. We will focus on rectal cancer because it is one of only a couple cancers where tumor
size and characteristics can be measured before and after treatment. We will enroll 300 newly diagnosed
localized rectal cancer patients (stage II-III) aged ≥18 (BMI ≥ 18.5 kg/m2). All participants will receive the standard
of care during oncological treatment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Cancer (Los Angeles, CA) or the University of
Alabama O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (Birmingham, AL) and be randomized to one of two eating
schedules: (1) control schedule: 12-hour or longer daily eating period; (2) TRE: 8-hour daily eating period (16
hours of daily fasting). Participants will be counseled to maintain their weight. All endpoints will be measured at
least three times: at diagnosis prior to the onset of chemoradiation (baseline), after chemoradiation treatment,
and at tumor resection (post-intervention). Our primary aim is to determine how TRE affects clinical outcomes,
including treatment-related adverse effects (toxicity index based on CTCAE v.5), patient-reported outcomes
(PRO-CTCAE) and quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30), and clinical (cCR) and pathological (pCR) complete
response rates. Aim 2 tests the Differential Stress Sensitization Theory—the first complete test of this theory in
humans. We test whether TRE acts through the IGF-1 pathway to increase stress resistance in healthy cells
(DNA damage and antioxidant defenses as measured by gamma-H2AX and total antioxidant capacity,
respectively) and enhance tumor cell death (apoptosis and autophagy as measured by activated caspase-3 and
LC3-I/LC3-II, respectively). Aim 3 compares longitudinal changes in mood, social functioning, sleep, diet, and
daily physical activity across intervention arms (control vs. TRE) and explore how these changes interact with
intervention arms to predict clinical outcomes. We expect this innovative trial will help improve cancer treatment
outcomes and reshape the standard of care for cancer patients."
10883735,"Exceptional Longevity and Biobehavioral Aging in Rhesus Macaques
As human lifespan increases, a critical challenge is to simultaneously improve healthspan, the length of time

has recently discovered that in a highly translational non-human primate (NHP) model of human health, the
rhesus macaque, some families exhibit exceptional longevity, analogous to humans. This discovery represents
a unique opportunity to identify drivers of a longer, healthier life, because it will allow us to pre-select
individuals predisposed to longevity for study. We will focus on identifying the biobehavioral health factors
(cognitive engagement, active stress coping, health promoting decisions) that play a role in healthy aging in
ExLong individuals, because they can improve well-being as we age, as well as drive healthier outcomes. To
accomplish these goals, we propose to create a new tool to survey biobehavioral aging in ExLong individuals
and controls in one of the largest resources of aging NHPs in the U.S. - the California National Primate
Research Center NIA funded aging colony. This resource includes 100 geriatric (20 years or older) rhesus
monkeys, with ~50 new monkeys “aging-in” annually. We will develop an innovative and high-throughput rapid
assessment that uses cutting edge technology to capture individual differences in biobehavioral aging:
cognitive decline vs. cognitive flexibility, depression vs. resilience, avolition vs. exploration, and social
motivation vs. withdrawal. We will then create a biobehavioral aging map in middle aged and geriatric rhesus
monkeys. Using these tools, we will validate the familial ExLong model and interrogate the unique
biobehavioral characteristics of ExLong individuals. This innovative aging model is anticipated to generate new
targets to increase healthspan and longevity."
10866499,"Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has already had a revolutionary impact on cell and molecular biology and become a major source of structural information. Still, the minimum number of parti- cles needed for a three-dimensional reconstruction of a structure, and the minimum size of the particles amenable to reconstruction, remains far above fundamental limits. Over the past four years, we have developed a laser-based phase-plate (LPP) that can contribute to reaching the standard quantum (shot-noise) limit of imaging in cryo-EM. We have tested it on the optical bench, demonstrated phase-contrast imaging, and exceeded all performance parameters that we set out to achieve. Now, at the beginning of the fourth year, we have already made first steps to- wards obtaining a density map of a known structure with the LPP; we fully expect to complete this goal by the end of the fourth year.
In this renewal proposal, we aim to achieve an even higher level of performance, one that will add significant value for many classes of problems in structural biology, and that will be well-received by the entire cryo-EM community as a basis for a user-friendly, commercially available product. To do this, we will partially automate data collection by creating new, data-driven feedback tools to maintain alignment of the LPP to the electron diffraction pattern. Upgrading the mechanical and optical design of the LPP will allow us to maintain stable coma-free alignment of the microscope. This upgrade will leverage the relativistic reversal effect, which we recently demonstrated, to elim- inate weak ghost images. In addition, to compensate for the larger chromatic aberration of our microscope in phase-plate mode, we will install a gun monochromator.
Using the LPP is expected to enable reconstructions for particles at the lower size limit of what is believed to be theoretically possible for cryo-EM. We expect this to also improve the power of 3D- classification to assign much larger particles into distinctly different conformational and composi- tional states. Throughout the project, we will establish the extent to which the LPP improves cryo- EM capabilities by performing reconstructions of a wide variety of biological specimens. We will determine the number of asymmetric units needed to produce high-resolution density maps, at equivalent values of the resolution, as well as the size of the smallest particles that can be recon- structed. As we advance the LPP, we will use more and more challenging test specimens, from apoferritin and a human, microtubule-associated protein to extremely small proteins, such as my- oglobin or lysozyme."
10875332,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal has the potential to alter the way health information is presented to vulnerable populations. Our
proposal promotes a more flexible and tailored approach to reach underserved groups. Racial/ethnic minority
women are at increased risk for postpartum depression, and their children as less likely to have had well-child
checkups in the past year. Moreover, racial/ethnic disparities are still prevalent for maternal and infant mortality
as well as various health behaviors such as safe sleep practices, breastfeeding, and infant nutrition. Currently,
some popular programs involve resource-intensive home visits (limited in scale due to staff and cost
constraints) or non-personalized text messages (may not directly address an individual’s questions). We
propose the development of a chatbot that addresses both of these possible limitations by representing a
scalable tool that can have widespread reach across geographies and is personalized and responsive to an
individual’s specific informational needs. We have built a prototype of the chatbot, Rosie, capable of engaging
in live question-and-answer sessions. Rosie is able to respond to 334 popular questions that new mothers may
have. Pretests with mother groups and Mary’s Center patients have showed a positive reception to the chatbot.
Over the course of the grant, we will leverage recent advances in natural language processing and the
emergence of efforts to aggregate massive amounts of health information, to assemble a comprehensive
health information library. We will further refine Rosie’s dialogue analyzer and response inference engine to
robustly recognize and respond to user’s questions in the various and complex ways they can phrase a
question. We will test the hypothesis that Rosie may lower risk of postpartum depression, decrease emergency
room visits, and increase attendance of well-baby visits. We will employ primarily a virtual recruitment strategy
to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of this intervention on maternal and infant
outcomes. Our investigative team—comprised of experts in the field of epidemiology, computer science,
biostatistics, and maternal and child health experts—is uniquely suited to implement the study aims. Our
Specific Aims are: 1) Develop technology for a chatbot, Rosie, that will provide health informational support to
vulnerable mothers the moment they need it; 2) Evaluate the use of Rosie on maternal and infant outcomes;
and 3) Release an open-source packet for the construction of a chatbot. Rosie provides informational support
to vulnerable moms the moment they need it and safeguards new moms from misinformation that is common
on the web with the ultimate goal of closing the gap in maternal and infant outcomes. Results and tools
developed from this proposal can be utilized to inform population-based strategies to reduce health disparities
and improve health."

Many cardiovascular and neurological disorders, and oncogenesis result from changes in cell mechanics.
Assessment of human pathophysiology in this context reveals that these diseases share a common root cause:
abnormal mechanotransduction – the process by which cells respond to physical stress and forces.
Mechanosensitive ion channels, the molecular machines by which cells convert external forces into electrical
response, are therefore emerging targets of interest, for understanding biological processes and for therapeutic
development.
Piezo family (Piezo1 and Piezo2) was discovered in 2010 as the first excitatory mechanosensitive ion channels
in vertebrates. Piezo channels are now known to be critical sensors of touch and pain (somatosensation), volume
regulation (osmosensation), shear stress (cardiovascular tone), baroreception, proprioception and respiratory
physiology, and may have other important functions yet to be discovered. Substantial efforts are made in the last
decade to identify Piezo related diseases and incidents within the United State population. So far, Piezo
dysfunction is linked to diverse pathologies including hypertension, lymphatic disease and anemias,
somatosensory and neurological disorders, cancer and metastasis, amongst others. Despite their biological and
medical relevance, the mechanism behind Piezo-dependent mechanotransduction remains elusive. Therefore,
our lab’s goal is to understand how physical forces such as pressure and membrane tension control Piezo1
function in health and diseased state.
This research proposal focuses on ion permeation and force-dependent gating mechanisms of Piezo1 channels,
in cells, as well as in reconstituted lipid bilayer systems. We will employ biochemical and biophysical techniques
in efforts to understand how lipid bilayer control the gating of Piezo1 and subsequent ion conduction across the
membrane. Moreover, we have identified robust expression and protein purification protocols to examine the
function of Piezo1 channels. Droplet lipid bilayers will be used to study the single channel conductance and open
probability of the purified protein in biologically relevant lipid compositions. Structurally identified pore domain of
Piezo1 will be used as a template to understand the pressure sensitivity and voltage-dependent inactivation -
hallmark of Piezo channels - by constructing various deletion mutants- heterologous expression in HEK cells.
The preliminary data is striking, and shows that the droplet bilayer approach coupled with traditional cellular
patch clamp assays are ideally suited to study mammalian Piezo1 channel function. We are convinced that a
comprehensive understanding of Piezo’s function is a timely contribution to the field of mammalian
mechanotransduction. Our unique proposal represents the application of single molecule investigation of Piezos.
Completion of this proposal will provide a path to dissect and kick-start the development of effective therapeutics
targeted towards neuropathic pain, brain ischemia and gliomas, amongst others."

 Determining the structure and conformational dynamics of large protein complexes as well as other
biological nanoparticles at room temperature with near atomic resolution has the potential to greatly impact
structural biology and our knowledge of biomolecular function and interactions. A major bottleneck in
structural biology is that while many critical cellular functions are performed by membrane proteins, they have
proven intractable to structure determination by traditional x-ray crystallography, in which x-ray radiation
damage is mitigated by spreading the radiation dose over many molecules in a crystal. Consequently, most
membrane protein structures remain unknown to date. While cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has been
successful in obtaining high-resolution structural information from large biomolecules and nanoparticles, it
requires freezing of the sample to mitigate electron-induced radiation damage and cryogenic measurement
makes it impossible to visualize fast conformational changes.
 X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs), which produce ultra-short and ultra-bright x-ray pulses, allow us to
break this nexus between resolution and radiation damage by utilizing the “diffraction-before-destruction”
principle and promise imaging at unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. Over the last decade since the
opening of the world's first XFEL, the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) at SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, protein structure determination at room temperature to near-atomic resolution by serial-
femtosecond nanocrystallography (SFX) has been demonstrated. However, several challenges and limitations
remain that need to be addressed to fully utilize the capabilities of these new light sources and the upcoming
next generation XFELs for structural biology.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to enable new science by addressing several of the current
technological and methodological challenges in x-ray diffractive imaging of biological samples with XFELs, in
particular in the areas of sample preparation for membrane proteins that, generally, suffer from low abundance
and/or are hard to crystallize, sample introduction technologies enabling high data acquisition rates, and novel
approaches to time-resolved structure determination of membrane proteins. This work will also drastically
reduce sample consumption and will increase the diversity of membrane protein and other biological nano-
objects that can be studied with XFELs. The proposed work also aims to develop new capabilities for time-
resolved structural studies at XFELs to include cross-membrane potential triggered membrane protein
dynamics, enabling investigation of a broader range of biomolecular and cellular reactions and the associated
structural change over a large range of times scales from microseconds to milliseconds. If successful, this work
would greatly aid our experimental capabilities to study and understand function of protein complexes and
biological nanoparticles in a wide range of fields including human health and biosecurity."

Our long-term goal is to foster genetically-informed reproductive health knowledge and behaviors among
young adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) or sickle cell trait (SCT) with a web-based, tailored, multimedia
intervention (CHOICES). In follow-up to genetic counseling, CHOICES helps them engage in behaviors
concordant with their parenting plan. Developed with the sickle cell community, CHOICES is designed to help
young adults with SCD or SCT gain knowledge of genetic inheritance, specify their preconception reproductive
health intentions (their parenting plan), and engage in reproductive health behaviors concordant with their
parenting plan. We found high acceptability of both the e-Book (usual care control) and CHOICES
interventions. We also found sustained (24 mo), significant effects on knowledge but not on at behavior,
presumably because 49% of the participants were not at risk of having a child with SCD (e.g., partner had
normal hemoglobin, Hgb A). Of the participants at risk of having a child with SCD (at-risk) and who expressed
intention to get pregnant soon and have a child free of SCD, the CHOICES group’s (n=26), behaviors showed
a 27% relative at-risk time reduction compared to the e-Book group (n=16). However, the difference was not
statistically significant given the small, underpowered sample (n=42). Hence, we propose an adequately
powered RCT with the CHOICES intervention and an e-Book control to compare their effects on genetic
inheritance knowledge and at-risk reproductive health behaviors (immediate posttest and at 6, 12, 18, & 24
mo). Using proven strategies (referrals, social media, and communication technology) for recruiting and
retaining the sample, we will use web-based data collection (SCKnowIQ) and intervention delivery strategies
enhanced by nudges and tailored boosters. In a sample of 430 adult men and women, aged 18-35 yr with SCD
or SCT, at-risk, and planning within 2 years to have a child free of SCD, the specific aims are to: Aim 1.
Compare e-Book and CHOICES groups for effects on (a) knowledge (primary endpoint), and (b) at-risk
behavior (secondary endpoint) measured with the SCKnowIQ over time (baseline, post-test, 6,12, 18,24 mo).
We hypothesize that across all time points post baseline, there will be (a) higher knowledge scores and (b)
lower percentage of time with at-risk behaviors (at-risk time) in the CHOICES than in the e-Book groups.
Aim 2. Explore the relationship between demographic factors (e.g., sex, SC status), intervention acceptability,
and the Aim1 endpoints (knowledge, behavior). We will conduct subgroup analyses to provide insight into the
baseline knowledge and behavior as well as the intervention effects in different demographic or acceptability
groups. Given the scalability and low cost of CHOICES, if proved to be effective, it can reach the affected
population at low cost. As a genetic counseling follow-up model, CHOICES may translate into informed
parental decisions and preparedness for the consequences of their preconception decisions. Considering the
implications for SCD and other single-gene diseases globally, the potential impact is enormous."
10876338,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transport of nucleic acids and proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is essential for nearly all cellular
processes, and when mis-regulated, is associated with diseases, tumor formation/growth, and cancer
progression. Canonically, this indispensable process has been thought to occur exclusively via Nuclear
Pore Complexes, which span the nuclear envelope’s double membranes and provide a critical regulatory
step in what exits (and enters) the nucleus. Recently, Nuclear Envelope (NE-) budding was shown to
provide an alternative pathway for nuclear exit, particularly for large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes
that would otherwise need to unfold/remodel to fit through the pores. In this pathway, large
macromolecule complexes are encapsulated by the inner nuclear membrane, cross the perinuclear
space, fuse with the outer nuclear membrane, and are released into the cytoplasm, a mechanism
strikingly similar to herpesvirus nuclear egress. Thus, NE-budding elegantly allows for large RNP
complexes to exit the nucleus together and be delivered as a package for specific cellular functions.
Despite its clear biological importance and clinical relevance, very little is yet known about the regulatory
or structural machineries that allow NE-budding to occur in any system. Recently, we found that the
Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome family actin nucleation protein, WASH, its four subunit regulatory complex
(SHRC), and Arp2/3 are necessary for NE-budding. Using WASH/SHRC as a new entry point, in tandem
with strategies to discover novel genes/proteins involved in this process, our long-term goal is to
understand the molecular and cellular mechanics that govern NE-budding. The specific aims of this
proposal are to determine the mechanism(s) of WASH/SHRC function in NE-budding, and to
identify/analyze the infrastructural components/machineries governing the dynamic NE-budding process
using a combination of genetic, biochemical, cell biological, time-lapse live imaging, and super-
resolution/EM microscopy approaches. Drosophila provides an excellent, genetically amenable,
organism for studying this conserved process due to its amenability for imaging and the wealth of cutting
edge cell/molecular techniques and reagents. The information gathered in these studies will help to
elucidate the mechanisms governing this exciting new nuclear export pathway in normal development or
when mis-regulated in disease conditions, and may inform the study of herpesvirus nuclear egress as
well."
10872250,"The malignant brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) is highly infiltrative. Migrating GBM cells are exposed to
biomechanical forces during tumor invasion, however, little is understood of the mechanosensitive pathways
that enable GBM cells to gain invasiveness. Here, we postulate that Plexin guidance receptors, focusing in this
proposal on Plexin-B2 and its paralog Plexin-D1 (both highly upregulated in GBM and correlated with poor
patient survival), may function as key mechanoregulators to enhance mechanotension-induced glioma cell
migration. Our hypothesis is built upon a series of exciting recent discoveries: in orthotopic transplant models,
using patient-derived GBM stem cells (GSCs), we found that Plexin-B2 knockout (KO) resulted not only in
reduced tumor spread, but also strikingly a change of migration preference from axon tracts to peri-vascular
routes. Moreover, while GSCs spread on both soft and stiff substrates in stripe assays, Plexin-B2 KO GSCs
congregated on stiff stripes, a migratory behavior known as durotaxis. The ability of Plexin-B2 to empower
GBM cells to overcome durotaxis tendency has clinical significance: as GBM progresses, the bulk of the tumor
gradually stiffens, in part from increased pressure; tumor cells therefore must find a way to break from tumor
bulk to invade softer brain parenchyma, and our preliminary data suggest that Plexin upregulation might fulfill
this role. To further dissect mechanotension-induced GBM invasion, we will study mechanistic details of Plexin-
B2 and -D1 as mechanoregulators in governing GBM invasion, with the aim to identify novel targets to curb
GBM infiltration. In Aim 1, we will expand in vivo transplant studies to test how Plexin-mediated GBM invasion
patterns and migratory paths applies to different GBM subtypes. We will then investigate how differentiation
status and metabolic niche (hypoxia) may alter the choice of migration routes in dependence of Plexins. We
will validate these findings in human GBM tissues. In Aim 2, we will delve into how Plexins operate to promote
invasiveness. We will apply a series of mechanosensitive assays to interrogate Plexin-mediated biomechanical
properties of migrating GBM cells, including intercellular adhesiveness, cell dispersion capacity, actomyosin
dynamics, as well as infiltrative behavior in 3D vascular models. We will test how migrating GBM cells respond
to different substrate stiffness, matrix substrates, and dissociated state, and how Plexins may alter durotactic
behavior. We will define mechanoresponse pathways in GBM cells and use them as readouts to directly test
Semaphorin- and mechano-dependent functions of Plexins. Finally, in Aim 3, we will interrogate downstream
effectors of Plexin-B2 mechanosignaling. This includes the interaction of Plexins with the mechanosensitive
Hippo/YAP pathway, and potential relay mechanisms through intracellular proteins Rap2 or AMOT. In sum, by
studying mechano-sensitive mechanisms of GBM invasion, we explore new paradigms of GBM malignancy,
with the ultimate goal to identify new therapeutic opportunities against this lethal cancer."
10863957,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Antibiotic resistance is a major global public health threat, with approximately three million resistant infections
reported each year in the US alone. Many distinct mechanisms of antibiotic resistance have been observed in
bacteria, but pervasive among Gram-negative pathogens is the ability to actively efflux drugs out of the cell.
Efflux pumps in the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) family contribute extensively to intrinsic, clinical
antibiotic resistance. RND pumps are tripartite complexes composed of an inner membrane transporter protein,
a periplasmic adaptor protein, and an outer membrane factor protein. Many Gram-negative pathogens encode
multiple RND systems; for example, the serious threat pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa contains four RND
efflux systems that contribute to antibiotic resistance. Here, two of these pumps, MexAB-OprM and MexXY-
OprM, will serve as an ideal model to define the basis of substrate selectivity due to their overlapping but distinct
preferences for b-lactams and aminoglycosides, respectively. Although preferred substrates are known, the
molecular determinants behind substrate recognition are not currently understood. Guided by the published
structure of MexAB-OprM, our lab generated a model for MexXY-OprM. Using this structural framework for
comparison of the transporter proteins MexB and MexY, specific regions and residues within them were identified
that could underpin substrate selectivity. In particular, the distal binding pocket (DBP) is predicted to be critical
for substrate selection and translocation within the transporter protein. Based on these findings, I hypothesize
that critical residues within the distal binding pocket (DBP) of MexY define its physicochemical
properties (shape, charge, distribution, and volume) that control aminoglycoside substrate recognition
and translocation. In this project, I will test this hypothesis and elucidate the molecular basis of substrate
selectivity and translocation through the transporter MexY of the P. aeruginosa RND efflux pump MexXY-OprM.
In Aim 1, I will determine the preferred aminoglycoside entry channel(s) from the cell periplasm into the
transporter MexY using mutagenesis coupled with in vivo functional assays in both lab and pan-aminoglycoside
resistant clinical isolates and high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy structural studies. In Aim 2, I will
define the residues within the DBP of MexY that control selectivity for substrates over non-substrates (e.g.
aminoglycosides over b-lactams) by using in vitro binding affinity and high-resolution X-ray crystallographic
structural studies, complemented with in vivo functional assays. Understanding what defines uptake, binding,
and selection for substrates versus non-substrates by RND transporters can provide critical insight into antibiotic
resistance mechanisms and influence the redesign of current therapeutics or design of novel efflux pump
inhibitors. Because 11 of the 14 bacterial pathogens currently identified by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention as “urgent” or “serious” contain at least one RND efflux pump, these alternative therapeutic strategies
are urgently needed to combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance."

Biotic processes in the oceans introduce various halogenated molecules in the environment and in the human
exposome. Some of these halogenated molecules possess favorable pharmaceutical activities making them
attractive drug candidates while many of these naturally produced marine halogenated molecules are potent
toxins and pollutants. Understanding, at the organismal, molecular, and atomistic levels how these
halogenated molecules are naturally constructed in the oceans is the principal motivation of the research
program described herein.
Seaweeds and filter feeding marine benthic invertebrates such as sponges are well validated to be
exceptionally prolific producers of halogenated natural products. Contrary to prokaryotic natural product
biochemistry, our understanding of how these eukaryotes biosynthesize natural products is far less
developed due to challenges in culturing and genetically interrogating these organisms. This is the key
scientific challenge that this proposal seeks to address in order to deliver seaweed- and sponge-derived
halogenated natural products using biogenetic means.
Progress envisaged here is predicated upon two key intellectual drivers. The first of these is the sequencing
of eukaryotic transcriptomes, rather than genomes, to circumvent the eukaryotic genome complexity. The
second driver is to design natural product biosynthetic schemes based on intermediates that are mined from
untargeted metabolomic datasets and then use these rationalized schemes to guide the mining of eukaryotic
transcriptomes for biosynthetic enzyme discovery. Specifically, halogenated intermediates and halogenating
enzymes are used as diagnostic signatures in this workflow.
Interdisciplinary competence in genomics, biochemistry, synthetic biology, and metabolomics allows the
program participants to not only interrogate biogenetic pathways for the production of marine eukaryote-
derived halogenated pharmacophores and pollutants, but to also use the genetic dark matter locked away in
marine holobiont metagenomes to produce new-to-nature halogenated molecules with favorable
pharmaceutical bioactivities. The program design also embraces opportunities to discover and characterize
new halogenation enzymology and adapt halogenases as general purpose biocatalysts. Research described
here is both molecule focused, in that, it will lead to the understanding of how key halogenated molecules of
interest are constructed in marine sponge biomes, while concomitantly embracing method-development and
engineering opportunities."

Disorders of the brain remain an enormous medical challenge. New platforms that allow functional testing in
high-fidelity systems that incorporate patient tissue and high-throughput capacity are urgently needed to bridge
gap between cell-based assays and whole-animal testing. We propose a multi-institutional effort to identify,
develop, and initiate translation of therapeutic neurological agents using the organotypic brain slice culture
(OBSC) platform. Our OBSC models leverage existing cellular and extracellular milieu in the live brain slices to
allow rapid, functional testing on brain tissue. Our multi-disciplinary team, which spans three CTSA Program
hubs (UNC, Duke, and Univ. Florida), has developed multiple models for neurological disorders and shown the
effectiveness of the OBSC platform to discover new mechanisms of disease and identify new therapeutic
compounds. We have developed technological innovations for OBSC modeling, including elevated-throughput
techniques for brain slicing, viral- and biolistic-based transduction of disease-relevant genes, targeted gene
knockdown, real-time monitoring using reporter assays, and incorporation of fresh patient tissue. We now seek
to leverage the power of the OBSC platform and experience of our team to broaden the utility of the OBSC
platform and ultimately improve the care for patients suffering from brain disorders. Our multi-institutional team
will bring together and share new disease models, curated panels of therapeutic agents, unique molecular tool
kits, and clinical patient tissue. Within the areas of neurodegenerative disease, brain cancers and ischemic
disease, we will add disease-relevant capabilities to the platform, screen therapeutic agents, and enable new
immune-based approaches, the fastest-growing area of clinical research, with a particular focus on the brain
microenvironment. Approaches to accomplish our aims are: (i) We will use OBSC models of neurodegenerative
disease to develop methods for tracking of cell signaling using real-time optical imaging, define molecular
pathways mediating inflammatory drivers of disease, and identify effective new therapeutic agents. (ii) We will
use fresh patient biopsy samples and OBSC models of aggressive brain cancer to characterize he cellular and
genomic heterogeneity of brain tumors, the efficacy of anti-cancer immune therapies, and perform drug screens
to identify new therapeutic agents. (iii) Lastly, we will utilize OBSC models of ischemic disease to develop
methods for pooled molecular screening, investigate the impact of microglia on stroke progression, and identify
new compounds that reduce infarct size. Together, our approaches will create an expandable infrastructure built
around OBSC technology, accelerate the discovery of new and effective therapeutic strategies, and initiate
translation towards ultimate human patient trials to treat multiple disorders of the brain."

Research: Therapeutic resistance limits the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy for cancer: only 40% of melanoma
patients respond to this therapy, and half of these will develop resistance. Resistance can arise from several
mechanisms including mutations acquired by cancer cells or infiltration of tumors by immunosuppressive immune
cells. There is a critical need to understand resistance mechanisms to develop novel immunotherapeutic
strategies to overcome them. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that cancer cells with resistance
mutations recruit unique immunosuppressive myeloid populations that can be targeted to overcome resistance
to anti-PD-1. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will determine how clinically-defined resistance mutations
impact immunosuppressive myeloid populations in mouse models using single-cell RNA-sequencing and in
human melanoma biopsies using multiplex immunofluorescence. In Aim 2 we will determine how inhibition of
myeloid cells can overcome resistance to anti-PD-1 with mechanistic mouse studies. This research will define
how to personalize immunotherapy based on a patient’s unique cancer mutations and infiltrating
immunosuppressive myeloid cells, with the long-term goal to improve responses to immunotherapy.
Candidate and Mentorship: The PI, Brian Miller, MD PhD, is an oncologist and cancer immunologist at the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. He spends 90% of his time in translational research
and 10% in clinical practice caring for patients with cancer. His goal is to lead an independent academic research
laboratory studying the functions of myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment and developing therapeutic
strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy. He will pursue this goal by: 1) developing expertise in the
generation and analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data; 2) becoming an expert in myeloid cell biology and
developing in vitro and in vivo functional assays; 3) establishing a community of mentors and collaborators; 4)
completing coursework to expand his computational and statistical background. He will be mentored by Dr.
Arlene Sharpe, an expert in tumor immunology, along with a strong scientific advisory committee with expertise
in computational biology, myeloid cells, and translational immunotherapy: Dr. Peter Kharchenko, Dr. Jon Kagan,
and Dr. Stephen Hodi. These mentors and his career development plan will help him acquire the skills and
expertise needed to develop his own distinct niche in single-cell analysis of the tumor microenvironment and
functional dissection of tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells.
Environment: Dr. Miller will conduct this research at Harvard Medical School and leverage the exceptional
research and teaching environment at Harvard, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the Broad Institute. In
addition, his network of collaborators at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Broad Institute, and Bristol-Myers
Squibb will provide reagents, technical assistance, and expertise to ensure his success. Dr. Miller has access to
the necessary tools to successfully complete his proposed research and transition to independence."

 Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a devastating inherited disease associated with progressive bone marrow failure
(BFM), congenital abnormalities, and cancer predisposition. FA patients harbor biallelic mutations in any one
gene member of the FA pathway consisting of 22 genes. Most mutations happen in the FA core complex
including the FA Complementation Group C (FANCC) gene. FANCC-mediated FA (group C) patients show
typical clinical symptoms of FA. Currently, the treatment focuses on mitigating BMF, the leading cause of early
mortality in pediatric patients, and secondary malignancies. Allogenic stem cell transplantation is the preferred
therapy to treat BMF in patients with matched donors. However, transplanted patients show enhanced risk of
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and secondary cancer. An alternative approach that overcomes the limitations
of allogenic stem cell transplantation involve the gene therapy to correct mutations in patient stem cells, and then
transplant back corrected stem cells into the patient. CRISPR/Cas9 is the state-of-the-art technology that allows
modifying the genome seamlessly. Scientists have used this technology to precisely correct mutations in blood
stem cells that can be applied for the treatment of genetic blood diseases (hemoglobinopathies and
immunodeficient disorders). This approach depends on a pathway called homology-directed repair (HDR) that
is only active in dividing cells. However, blood stem cells from FA patients are defective in cell growth due to
sustained DNA damage. Thus, the efficiency of HDR approach might reach the therapeutic threshold for FA
gene therapy. Here, we propose an alternative approach called homology-independent targeted integration
(HITI) to introduce an intact DNA sequence encoding for functional FANCC gene into the endogenous FANCC
promoter (a regulatory DNA sequence that controls expression of the FANCC gene). This system can be applied
to correct all mutations occurring in all FA group C patients. The HITI approach is dependent on the DNA repair
pathway called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Unlike HDR, NHEJ is highly active in all cells including
slow/non-dividing cells. Thus, we expect that HITI-mediated gene correction will be efficient in FA patient derived
stem cells. We have developed all necessary systems to validate the gene editing efficiency and functions of the
edited cells both in vivo and in vitro. We also generated a surrogated model of FA by knockout of FANCC in
human CD34+ cells. These cells show typical phenotypes of FA-HSPCs, thus providing a powerful model for
optimizing our gene editing system. Of note, albeit low efficiency, the function of HDR-corrected mouse HSPCs
was partially rescued in vitro. Thus, high editing efficiency using HITI will fully rescue functions of corrected stem
cells. Our proposal will provide an improved approach to precisely correct patient FANCC mutations with high
efficacy. Our long-term goal is to develop a comprehensive pre-clinical model for gene therapy of FA group C.
Outcomes from this proposal will create a strong foundation for developing gene therapy to treat FA group C
disease as well as understanding the disease mechanism."

The balance between triacylglycerol (TAG) storage and mobilization in adipose tissue and liver is critical to metabolic health as the dysregulation during obesity can produce ectopic accumulation of lipids in muscle and liver, resulting in the progression to diabetes and fatty liver disease (FLD). Thus, an important long-term scientific goal is to understand the tissue-specific molecular mechanisms that control TAG metabolism in order to discover novel therapies. Patatin-Like Phospholipase Domain Containing 3 (PNPLA3) is a protein that is highly expressed in lipogenic tissues, like fat and liver, and is highly upregulated under conditions that promote fat storage. Importantly, a common genetic variant of PNPLA3, I148M, is the greatest known risk factor for developing FLD and its pathological sequelae. In recently published and preliminary data, we demonstrate that α/β hydrolase domain containing protein 5 (ABHD5), an enzyme co-activator, strongly interacts with PNPLA3 and the disease-causing I148M variant is a gain-of-function. Furthermore, the interaction between PNPLA3 I148M and ABHD5 is particularly effective in promoting cellular TAG retention, which likely plays a central role in disease progression. Importantly, the ABHD5/PNPLA3 interaction can be dynamically regulated by endogenous fatty acids and synthetic ABHD5 ligands. This work will examine the basic mechanism of how ABHD5 regulates the function of PNPLA3 and the I148M variant in adipocytes and hepatocytes using high resolution imaging techniques, proximity proteomics and metabolic tracers/lipidomics in conjunction with robust genetic models and an integrative panel of endogenous fatty acid ligands and chemical probes. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To determine the molecular basis for the interaction of ABHD5 with WT PNPLA3 and I148M and the subcellular location and dynamic trafficking of ABHD5 complexes in adipocytes and hepatocytes using high resolution fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. 2) To determine the location and ligand-dependent protein composition of the ABHD5/PNPLA3 and ABHD5/ PNPLA3 I148M metabolons using nonbiased proximity proteomics and directed immunoprecipitation. 3) To dissect the metabolic function of the ABHD5/PNPLA3 and ABHD5/PNPLA3 I148M metabolons in adipocytes and hepatocytes using gain- and loss- of-function genetics and selective endogenous and synthetic ABHD5 ligands in conjunction with isotope tracers and lipidomics. These goals, which are well aligned with the mission of the NIH will be implemented within a discovery platform that maximizes integration across level of analysis (molecular, organelle, cells and tissues) to provide a robust analysis of ABHD5/PNPLA3 function, thereby improving our understanding of how lipids levels are regulated and identify novel points for therapeutic intervention in obesity related disorders."
10861777,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Lung transplantation is a life-extending therapy for end-stage lung disease, but necessitates life-long
immunosuppression with agents that have narrow therapeutic windows and inevitable side effects. Mycophenolic
acid (MPA) is the antiproliferative agent of choice. Unlike other agents, routine therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)
is not performed for MPA because it is challenging to measure area under the curve from 0–12 hours (AUC) to
accurately assess pharmacokinetics (PK). MPA levels vary widely among transplant recipients, and excess
levels are associated with adverse outcomes such as neutropenia, which affects >40% of lung transplant
recipients receiving MPA and negatively affects outcomes. This variability is due in part to differences in genes
involved in MPA metabolism and affects outcomes. We previously identified a link between single nucleotide
polymorphisms in SLCO1B3, a key gene in MPA metabolism, and acute rejection and survival in lung transplant
recipients. Although this and other associations are now known, there has been no attempt to incorporate genetic
data into TDM strategies for MPA or develop an evidence-based therapeutic range for MPA in lung transplant
recipients. We are developing a tool that integrates PK, genetic, and clinical data to predict dose-normalized
AUC for lung transplant recipients receiving MPA. This tool will require a single time-point PK measurement and
will provide an easily available tool for MPA PK research and clinical management. Unfortunately, target MPA
AUC ranges have not been defined due to the lack of routine MPA TDM in lung transplant recipients. We
hypothesize that an optimal MPA concentrations provides adequate immunosuppression while preserving
immune cell function, and that MPA level variability has a strong genetic component. Therefore, we will achieve
three aims in this K01 study. (1) Determine a target therapeutic range for MPA in lung transplant recipients. (2)
Identify genetic factors that influence dose-normalized MPA concentration. (3) Establish the relationships
between MPA exposure, genetic polymorphisms, and neutrophil function, which are key factors in innate and
adaptive immune systems. This will improve clinical practice and outcomes in lung transplant recipients by
enhancing drug efficacy and reducing adverse effects. This experimental work is integrated with a
comprehensive career development plan that builds on Dr. Tague’s previous training (MD, Master of Science in
Clinical Investigation, research in genetics and translational medicine) to become an independent investigator in
pharmacogenetics, bioinformatics, statistical genetics, and genetic epidemiology in lung transplantation. The
stated goals will be achieved through excellent mentoring, premium coursework, and training in scientific
communication. The unique resources and infrastructure of Washington University are ideal for the proposed
plan. This K01 will provide the necessary tools to develop into an independent clinician-investigator focused on
the pharmacogenetics of lung transplant immunology who can secure R01 funding."
10953745,"PROJECT SUMMARY: BIOINFORMATICS SHARED RESOURCE (BISR)
The Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BISR) continues to provide cutting-edge support in bioinformatics and
computational biology for basic, translational, and clinical research programs throughout MD Anderson. Its
personnel include 15 faculty, 15 statistical analysts, 2 bioanalysts, and 10 software engineers, all associated with
the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (DBCB) led by John Weinstein, MD, PhD. DBCB,
a leader in bioinformatics nationally and internationally, provides high-quality academic research, education, and
computer science as vital “infrastructure” for the BISR's support function. The BISR analyzes a comprehensive
spectrum of bioinformatic data types, including sequences (whole genome, whole exome, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq,
ChiRP-seq; bisulfite-seq, ATAC-seq, etc.); DNA, RNA, and protein microarrays; flow cytometry (fluorescence
and CyTOF); mass spectrometry (targeted and discovery for proteomics and metabolomics); siRNA, shRNA;
CRISPR/Cas9; histopathological and clinical images including CyTOF images; and marker-driven clinical trial
data. In addition, BISR faculty and software engineering teams develop professional-grade, user-friendly
visualization and analysis software for use at MD Anderson and worldwide. BISR faculty are currently lead
principal investigators on 4 NIH U24 grants and an NIH U01 grant for development, application, and sharing of
the software. The BISR is proactive in education, both for the next generation of informatics specialists (through
the MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Rice University, and Baylor
College of Medicine) and for biologists and clinical researchers who wish to learn elements of data science.
Bioinformatics assistance can be requested through 1) the BISR website, 2) weekly walk-in clinics, 3) informal
contact, or 4) a DBCB faculty member designated as a liaison for each department or program. As much as
possible, BISR analysts and faculty work longitudinally with particular departments and programs to maximize
continuity and domain expertise. Over the previous grant cycle, the BISR has supported >900 projects for 355
cancer center members (219 with peer-reviewed funding) in 64 MD Anderson departments, representing all 16
CCSG programs. Included were all 13 MD Anderson Moon Shots plus SPOREs, P01s, and R01s. The most
active BISR users were the Head and Neck Cancer (21% total usage), Hematologic Malignancies (15%), and
Lung Cancer (11%) CCSG programs. Peer-review funded investigators accounted for 85% of the usage, and
6% ($240,027) of total costs are requested from the CCSG. The BISR has no chargebacks, but users are
expected to provide support if their projects are large. BISR faculty averaged 10.3 authorships in 2017, with more
than 500 authorships over the 6-year period. BISR staff plus faculty have contributed to 865 papers since the
last review: 114 (13%) in journals with IF >20, 273 (32%) in those with IF >10, and 624 (72%) in those with IF
>5. The BISR's focus on issues of rigor, reproducibility, accessibility, and interoperability is in tune with FAIR
principles and the NIH's new Data Science initiative, in which DBCB is primed to participate."
10953749,"PROJECT SUMMARY: FUNCTIONAL PROTEOMICS REVERSE PHASE PROTEIN ARRAY (RPPA) CORE
The Functional Proteomics Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) Core provides the MD Anderson Cancer
Center members and the cancer research community with a powerful, high-throughput, quantitative, cost-
effective functional proteomic platform. RPPA measures levels of protein expression and post-translational
modification needed for systems biology analysis across large numbers of tumor samples or cell lines. The RPPA
Core commenced operations in 2008 with Dr. Yiling Lu as director and recently added Dr. Rehan Akbani as
co-director. Current services include protein extraction, robotic arraying of cell/tumor lysates, probing with
validated antibodies, and reporting protein expression and modifications to clients. Data are analyzed using
customized software (ArrayPro and Supercurve Fitting) to provide signal intensity, curve construction, and
relative protein concentration. Importantly, the facility continuously expands the antibody repertoire and has
extensively revised its pipeline with emphasis on improved delivery times, quality and accuracy of data. To
ensure the utility of the RPPA resource, Drs. Lu and Akbani have multiple active collaborations at MD Anderson,
nationally and internationally for their scientific activities and career development. Dr. Lu is the recipient of an
NCI Research Specialist (R50) grant, and Dr. Akbani has received 2 U24 grants and an NCI RPPA data
generation contract. Since initiating operation, the facility has processed 155,855 samples from 605 investigators
(183 cancer center members and 422 external investigators) with between 150 and 302 antibodies. In grant
Yr42, 72% of all samples were from peer review-funded users, with the CCSG Breast Cancer and Gynecological
Cancers programs both responsible for 25% of the samples. Many of the external users are from other NCI
designated cancer centers, including 77 U.S. academic institutions. Over the past 6 years, the RPPA Core has
supported 285 publications, with 230 (81%) in journals with IF >5 and 101 (35%) in those with IF >10, including
high-profile journals such as N Engl J Med, Nature, and Cell. Furthermore, it provided functional proteomic
analysis for 7991 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, representing 32 disease types, and the RPPA Core
is currently 1 of 2 approved NCI Genomic Characterization Centers. The estimated total operating budget for the
current Yr43 is $1,194,149, with 15% ($183,777) from the CCSG. For the past 6-year grant period, MD Anderson
provided $1,221,041 of capital equipment support. In the next grant period, $187,727/year (14%) is requested
from the CCSG. The RPPA specific aims are: Aim 1) To provide functional proteomic assessment of patient,
animal model, and cell line samples to MD Anderson center members using a robust, cost-effective, unbiased
antibody-based RPPA approach to analyze the functional status of major signaling pathway networks; Aim 2)
To expand the repertoire of validated antibodies for use with RPPA; and Aim 3) To improve quality control of the
RPPA data; and Aim 4) To improve the RPPA technology by expanding it to include spatial orientation and
quantitative approaches for multiplex analysis."

10953752,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
The Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics (CGE) Program was formed in 2012 and consists of 52 members (36 
primary, 15 associate and 1 adjunct) from 10 departments. Dr. Sharon Dent, an international leader in defining 
the function and regulation of histone-modifying proteins, leads the program. Dr. Guillermina Lozano, a leading 
authority on the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, and Dr. David Johnson, an expert on the functions of the E2F 
family of proteins in transcription, DNA repair and cell growth control, serve as co-leaders. The major scientific 
goal of the program is to define the genetic, epigenetic and mechanistic changes that influence cancer to develop 
new and effective means to positively impact cancer diagnosis, treatment and cure. The program is organized 
around 3 major themes: 1) Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressors, 2) Epigenetic Regulators, and 3) Genome 
Maintenance. Each theme is addressed by a specific aim. Aim 1: To define molecular pathways important in 
human cancers using genetic and genomic approaches in model organisms, cellular systems and patient-derived 
tissues; Aim 2: To define functions of epigenetic regulators in normal and disease states and explore how these 
functions can be exploited for development of new therapeutics or diagnostics; Aim 3: To define the molecular 
machinery that responds to DNA damage and other stresses to maintain genome integrity and tissue 
homeostasis and to understand how dysfunction of these mechanisms contributes to cancer. CGE annual direct 
funding totals $10.2M with $2.5M from the NCI, $7.7M from other peer-reviewed sources, such as CPRIT, the 
Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, the American Cancer Society, and breast and prostate cancer research funding 
from the U.S. Department of Defense. Total program peer-reviewed funding reflects an increase of 7% since the 
last competitive renewal. The program has also produced 779 published papers, with 132 (17%) reflecting intra- 
programmatic collaborations (an increase of 5%), 270 (35%) reflecting inter-programmatic collaborations (an 
increase of 6%), and 571 (73%) reflecting inter-institutional collaborations. Sixty-five percent of articles appeared 
in journals with IF >5, and 27% of articles were published in journals with IF >10, including N Engl J Med, Nature, 
Science, Lancet Oncol, Cell, Cancer Cell, Cancer Discov, J Clin Oncol, and JAMA Oncol. Program members 
have collectively used all CCSG shared resources. Research accomplishments during the last grant period 
include definition of the origin and evolution of breast tumor cell heterogeneity, development of the first small- 
molecule inhibitor of the TRIM24 bromodomain, identification of the YEATS domain as a new epigenetic “reader” 
of acetylated lysine implicated in leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer, and the discovery that the BRCA1- 
interacting protein ABRAXAS and the related protein ABRO1, maintain genome integrity. These and other 
discoveries reflect the impact of our contributions to defining the mutations, epigenetic alterations, and cellular 
mechanisms that underlie oncogenesis."
10953753,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Immunology Program includes 30 members (26 primary, 3 associate, 1 adjunct) from 9 departments. The
program is led by Dr. James Allison, an international authority on exploring fundamental mechanisms of the
immune response and checkpoint control, with co-leaders Dr. Jeffrey Molldrem, providing expertise in stem cell
and translational research, and Dr. Patrick Hwu, lending his extensive experience in novel vaccines and
adoptive T-cell therapies. The scientific goal of the Immunology Program is to conduct important studies in basic
immunology and translate the findings into effective cancer immunotherapy. The program focuses on 4 themes:
1) immune regulation, 2) immune checkpoint blockade, 3) cancer vaccines, and 4) T-cell therapies, each with a
specific aim: Aim 1: To understand fundamental mechanisms involved in regulating innate and adaptive immune
responses. Aim 2: To elucidate fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune checkpoints and
their impact on the tumor microenvironment by using preclinical models and clinical trials to identify the basis for
failure of response to therapy or relapse. Aim 3: To identify novel targets for cancer vaccine development that
will enable vaccination strategies to be more widely applied to the prevention and treatment of cancer. Aim 4:
To improve the success rate of T-cell-based therapies using a combinatorial approach (T-cell therapy and
checkpoint control) to improve clinical responses. Work on the Immunotherapy Platform, led by program
members Drs. Allison, Padmanee Sharma, and Hwu and funded by the cancer center, spans multiple aims and
serves as a mechanism to foster iterative cycles of translation between basic and clinical work by providing
immune monitoring of patient samples and driving new preclinical and clinical studies by generating mechanistic
data to inform rational design of new drug combinations. As of May 1, 2018, 3,434 patients have been enrolled
across 118 different clinical trials. Annual direct peer-reviewed funding for the Immunology Program is $6.4M,
with $1.9M (30%) from NCI grants and $4.5M (70%) from other peer-reviewed sources. Since the last
submission, the program has produced 464 published papers: 184 (40%) are intraprogrammatic collaborations,
250 (54%) are interprogrammatic collaborations, and 278 (60%) are external collaborations. Sixty-five percent
of articles appeared in journals with IF >5, and 31% appeared in journals with IF >10, including N Engl J Med,
Nature, Cell, Science, Cancer Discov, Immunity, and Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. Program members use all 14

CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies act on distinct T-cell populations, providing an explanation for the benefit
achieved by combined therapy, and discovery of a positive correlation between gut microbiome diversity and
response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy that is transferred along with fecal transplants. See the

The Brain Cancer Program (BCP), a multidisciplinary basic, translational, and clinical research program, includes 
86 members (36 primary and 50 associate). Leadership is provided by physician-scientists: Amy Heimberger 
and Frederick Lang, both neurosurgeons; Juan Fueyo-Margareto, a laboratory-based investigator; and John 
de Groot, a neuro-oncologist. The overall goal of the BCP is to identify the genetic and molecular determinants 
of primary and metastatic brain tumor formation and progression and to use this knowledge to improve the 
survival and quality of life of patients through specifically targeted biological and small-molecule therapies. The 
program has 3 specific aims. Aim 1: To develop effective viral and immunotherapeutic treatment strategies that 
exploit glioblastoma heterogeneity. Aim 2: To determine how to optimize targeted approaches for central 
nervous system tumors. Aim 3: To define factors that promote the development of central nervous system 
metastases, devise strategies to prevent their formation, develop early detection or identify at-risk patients, and 
prioritize optimal therapeutic approaches. The BCP's annual direct peer-reviewed funding is $5.7M, including a 
Brain Cancer SPORE. Of the total peer-reviewed funding, $2.1M (37%) is from NCI grants, and $3.6M is from 
other peer-reviewed sources. BCP members have authored 703 publications in peer-reviewed journals over the 
past 6 years, of which 362 (51%) were intra-programmatic, 170 (24%) were inter-programmatic, and 485 (69%) 
involved external collaborations. Forty-one percent of publications have appeared in journals with IF >5, and 
13% have appeared in journals with IF >10, including Nature, Cancer Cell, Mol Cell, Lancet Oncol, J Clin Oncol, 
J Natl Cancer Inst, J Clin Invest, and Nat Genet. Accomplishments include major contributions to The Cancer 
Genome Atlas and key leadership roles in the international glioblastoma Adaptive Global Innovative Learning 
Environment Bayesian Clinical Trial. During the last grant period, members of the BCP made important 
contributions in evaluating transcriptome plasticity and radiation resistance in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) 
(Bhat et al, Cancer Cell, 2013) and the roles of Quaking in self-renewal and preventing terminal differentiation 
of GSCs (Hu J et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 2013; Shingu et al, Nat Genet, 2017), WNT5a in driving GSC 
differentiation into endothelial-like cells that support invasive glioblastoma cells (Hu B et al, Cell, 2016), and 
PKM2 in altering cell metabolism and cell-cycle progression with the Cancer Biology and Metastasis Program 
(Yang et al, Mol Cell, 2012; Yang et al, Cell, 2012; Jiang Y et al, Mol Cell, 2014; Jiang Y et al, Nat Commun, 
2014). Another important advance by BCP members is the use of stereotactic radiosurgery after brain metastasis 
resection as an alternative to whole-brain radiotherapy, which has influenced the standard of care for these 
patients nationally (Mahajan A et al, Lancet Oncol, 2017). We have seen a 50% decrease in the use of whole- 
brain irradiation at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center."

that can be translated into new treatment strategies for breast cancer patients. There are 3 themes: 1) Genetic
Alterations and Breast Cancer Evolution, 2) Biology of Established Breast Cancer, and 3) Targeted Therapy in
Breast Cancer. They have led to 3 specific aims: Aim 1: to elucidate the molecular and genomic evolutionary
basis of breast cancer development and progression; Aim 2: to examine the deregulation of signal transduction,
DNA repair, cell-cycle, and differentiation pathways in breast cancer that could provide therapeutic targets; Aim
3: to leverage scientific discoveries into novel therapeutics and bioassays for breast cancer management and
conduct innovative clinical trials and population-based studies that can reduce the burden of disease in the Texas
population. The annual direct peer-reviewed funding totals $5.4M, of which $3.2M (60%) is from NCI grants.
Since the last competitive renewal, the program has authored 1,092 published papers: 562 (51%) represent
intra-programmatic collaborations, 360 (33%) represent inter-programmatic collaborations, and 695 (64%)
represent external collaborations. Forty-six percent of articles have appeared in journals with IF >5 and 18%
have appeared in journals with IF >10, including Cancer Discov, Cell, JAMA, J Clin Oncol, Lancet Oncol, Nature,
Nat Genet, and the N Engl J Med. Program members use all 14 shared resources. During the last grant period,
research substantially influenced the clinical practice for treatment of bone metastasis from breast cancer.
Another development was the Neo-Bioscore staging system, which improves upon the previously validated
CPS+EG system and allows its application in patients with ERBB2-positive disease. The CPS+EG system
influenced the incorporation of biological factors into the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on
Cancer breast cancer staging system. Program members have also made several impactful discoveries that
improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to subtypes of breast cancer, especially those with limited
therapeutic options. Studies carried out via inter-programmatic collaborations on triple-negative breast cancers
demonstrate a common evolutionary lineage along with a minor subpopulation of nonclonal cells, suggesting
that the majority of copy-number aberrations are acquired at the earliest stages of tumor evolution (Gao R et al,
Nat Genet, 2016); unveiling a molecular link among epithelial-mesenchymal transition, therapy resistance, and
metastasis (Zhang J et al, Nat Cell Biol, 2013); and identifying iDAPK1 as a novel therapeutic strategy in triple-
negative breast cancers with p53 mutations by modulating the mTOR/S6 pathway (Zhao J et al, J Clin Invest,
2015)."

inhibition for anal cancer, BRAF and EGFR inhibition for BRAFmut colorectal cancer (CRC), and PD-1 inhibition
with nivolumab and ipilimumab for microsatellite instability-high CRC. GICP members described the consensus
molecular subtypes of CRC and are in the process of using these subtypes to select patients for future clinical
trials/precision therapy strategies. Impactful preclinical work expanded on key concepts of collateral lethality, for
example, targeting metabolic gene malic enzyme 2 in SMAD4-deleted pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. GICP
members use 14 shared resources. Program research has led to strategic alliance agreements with Merck, Ionis

The Lung Cancer Program (LCP) includes 70 members (34 primary, 35 associate, 1 adjunct) from 19
departments. The program is led by Dr. John Heymach, an expert in biomarker-driven clinical trials and
therapeutic targeting who oversees the program; Dr. Jack Roth, a surgeon-scientist and co-PI of the University
of Texas Lung SPORE; and Dr. Lauren Byers, who leads the program's clinical research efforts and mentoring
of trainees, fellows, and junior faculty. The major scientific goal of the LCP is to develop more effective and
personalized approaches for the treatment of lung cancer. To achieve this goal, the program has 3 specific aims
that focus on 3 themes: 1) lung cancer signaling and therapeutic targets; 2) targeting the immune system and
microenvironment; and 3) the multimodal treatment of localized and advanced lung cancer. The annual direct
peer-reviewed funding totals $5.7M, including an NCI Lung Cancer SPORE, a Stand Up 2 Cancer Dream Team
Award, and 3 CPRIT Multi-Investigator Research Awards. Of the total funding, $3.4M (60%) is from NCI grants.
Since the last competitive renewal, total annual peer-reviewed direct-cost funding has increased by 93%. Since
the last submission, the program has published 999 papers: 550 (55%) intra-programmatic collaborations, 355
(36%) inter-programmatic collaborations, and 607 (61%) external collaborations. Forty-four percent of the
publications appeared in journals with an IF >5, and 15% appeared in journals with an IF >10, including Science,
N Engl J Med, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, Cancer Discov, and Lancet Oncol. During the last grant period, program
members had leadership roles in standard-of-care–changing studies, including the AURA3 study (establishing
osimertinib for EGFR T790M–mutant NSCLC) and a study demonstrating the benefit of local consolidative
therapy for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC. Our previous findings identifying novel targets in small cell lung
cancer (SCLC) have been validated in subsequent clinical studies. Members also identified 3 subsets of KRAS-
mutant NSCLC based on co-occurring genomic alterations that exhibit distinct biology, patterns of immune-
system engagement, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Finally, they identified a role for epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition in regulating tumor immunosuppression via an miR200/ZEB1/PD-L1 axis, playing a central role in
promoting NSCLC metastasis. In upcoming years, members will build on these findings to identify new
approaches to target subsets of lung cancer, with a focus on SCLC and KRAS-mutant NSCLC; investigate
strategies for enhancing antitumor immunity and mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance; and develop
multidisciplinary paradigms integrating immunotherapy and targeted agents as an approach to improve the
survival of lung cancer patients."

the goal of enhancing our understanding of the pathobiology of hematologic malignancies, and leveraging this
new knowledge to develop effective personalized, targeted treatment strategies that ultimately will enable us to
cure all patients with these diseases. To achieve this goal, the HMP has the following specific aims: Aim 1: To
study the epigenome and identify novel drivers of malignant disease and to develop therapies targeted to these
features; Aim 2: To develop antibodies, vaccines, and adoptive cellular immunotherapies that boost immune
recognition and eliminate malignant cells; Aim 3: To define microenvironmental influences on tumor biology and
drug resistance that modulate biomarkers and regulate chemosensitivity; and Aim 4: To validate novel therapies
in preclinical models and translate them in a rational, biomarker-driven approach to maximize their impact upon
patient outcomes. Program annual direct peer-reviewed funding totals $6.7M, of which $3.8M (57%) is from the
National Cancer Institute, including a SPORE in Leukemia. The HMP is leveraging strategic industry alliances
and the MD Anderson Moon Shots Program to enhance the breadth of investigator-initiated translational studies
and to strengthen understanding of basic biology of these malignancies. Over the last six years, HMP
investigators have authored more than 2017 publications where 1126 (56%) represent intra-programmatic

The central theme of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) is to practice the principles of precision
therapy, identifying new targets within the pathophysiology of a malignancy to develop novel agents that block
their functions and apply these agents to clinical trials in patients whose malignancies exhibit the biomarkers
signifying the presence or activity of the target protein or pathway. The program has 47 members (33 primary
and 14 associate) from 13 departments and is led by William Plunkett, who has developed multiple anti-
leukemic agents in the laboratory; Funda Meric-Bernstam, a physician-scientist who leads the phase 1
department; Giulio Draetta, a physician-scientist who has extensive experience in drug development; and
James Yao, a clinical trialist who has developed multiple targeted therapies. The program is organized around
4 major themes: 1) Discovery and Validation of Novel Targets, 2) Development of Novel Therapies, 3) Conduct
of Proof-of-Principle Clinical Trials, and 4) Development of Therapies for Rare Cancers. Each theme is
addressed by a specific aim. Aim 1: To identify and validate novel targets relevant to the molecular biology of
tumors; Aim 2: To develop agents against new targets individually and in combination therapies; Aim 3: To
conduct biomarker-driven trials with first-in-human agents or novel combinations; and Aim 4: To identify novel
therapies for rare tumors. Annual direct peer-reviewed funding totals $10,284,482, of which $2,839,686 (28%)
is from NCI grants, which is an increase of 109% in program annual direct peer-reviewed cancer-related funding
since the last competitive renewal. Since the last submission, DTP members have authored 1048 publications:
454 (43%) represent intra-programmatic collaborations, 681 (65%) represent inter-programmatic collaborations,
and 645 (62%) were inter-institutional collaborations. Fifty-nine percent of publications appeared in journals with
IF >5, and 23% appeared in journals with IF >10, including Blood, Cancer Cell, Cancer Discov, Cell, JAMA, J
Clin Invest, J Natl Cancer Inst, J Clin Oncol, Lancet, Lancet Oncol, Mol Cell, and Nature. During the last grant
period, several novel targets were identified, including miR-155 in lung cancer, S-phase kinase-associated
protein 2 ubiquitin ligase, and the susceptibility of tumors that depend on oxidative phosphorylation for survival.
Importantly, novel agents to inhibit each of these targets have been discovered by DTP members and are
currently in development. New agents include those that target miR-155, deficiency, the platinum exporter in
ovarian cancer, BLy3 in lymphoma, c-Kit, JAK2, and STAT3. DTP members have identified tumors that require
oxidative phosphorylation for their growth and have created a candidate inhibitor that is presently in clinical trials.
Drugs matched with activating mutations in the PI3K pathway increased phase 1 response rates from 6% to 27%
and increased the time before treatment failure. The 15-year analysis of the first chemoimmunotherapy trial in
previously untreated CLL revealed prognostic factors associated with the first cures of this disease (37%),
guiding the design of single-institution investigator-initiated trials that incorporate new targeted agents."

Program is to reduce the cancer burden in the population and improve quality of life in survivors through
innovative research aimed at optimizing cancer risk assessment, screening, early detection, and treatment-
associated outcomes from diagnosis through survivorship, with an ultimate goal of informing successful
interventions (e.g., in the Cancer Prevention Program). To achieve this goal, the RDO Program is organized into
3 specific aims focusing on 1) Cancer Etiology, 2) Early Detection, and 3) Care Delivery and Outcomes. Aim 1:
To discover genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors for cancer initiation. Aim 2: To perform biomarker
discovery for personalized risk assessment and early detection. Aim 3: To identify biological and social factors
influencing care delivery and patient outcomes. The annual direct peer-reviewed funding of the RDO Program
totals $11.4M, including 4 U01s, of which $5.4M (47%) is from the NCI. Over the past 6 years, program members
have authored 1211 published peer-reviewed papers, with 373 (31%) intra-programmatic, 594 (49%) inter-

IF >5, and 14% appeared in journals with IF >10, including Nat Biotechnol, Nat Genet and J Clin Oncol. Program
members used all 14 shared resources. Over this period, the RDO Program has had several major
accomplishments. First, in whole-genome genetic epidemiology studies, we identified genetic variants that
predispose to disease initiation, affect outcomes, or predict adverse responses to therapy. In multiple whole-
exome next-generation sequencing studies, the first of their kind, we are powered to discover variants of higher,
intermediate cancer risk. We have also surveyed genomic changes in precancerous tissues, shedding light on
early disease pathology. Second, we have uncovered novel blood-based biomarkers for early detection through
state-of-the-art profiling technologies. Key hits identified from proteomics and metabolomics promise to
complement low-dose CT scans in individuals at high risk for lung cancer. Third, as leaders in a consortium of
Texas academic institutions and the Texas Cancer Registry, we have studied patterns of screening, diagnosis,
treatment (e.g., chemotherapy and associated decision-making), and follow-up to impact state-wide policy. For
all of these endeavors, we continue to develop and enhance unique cohorts, including Cancer Patients and
Survivors, Mexican American, Premalignant Genome Atlas, Childhood Cancer Survivors, and organ-specific

discover biological pathways critical for cancer development and target these pathways in preclinical models. In
Aim 2, we will discover critical psychobiological, social, and conditional/situational determinants and predictors
of cancer risk behavior to inform future cancer preventive interventions. In Aim 3, we will develop and test novel
therapeutic and behavioral interventions in clinical and community-based trials to reduce cancer risk and promote
health in individuals at risk for cancer and cancer survivors. Thirty-five CPP members have annual direct peer-
reviewed funding of $12.8M, with $6.2M (48%) from the NCI. CPP members have authored more than 1322

31% appeared in journals with IF >5 and 10% appeared in journals with IF >10, including CA Cancer J Clin, N
Engl J Med, Lancet, JAMA, and Nature. Members have conducted research that used all 14 of the shared
resources. Major accomplishments include the demonstration that ARID1A loss is a common early oncogenic
event leading to PARP inhibitor sensitivity and the identification of oncogenic changes in precancerous polyps
in patients with hereditary colon cancer syndromes (Aim 1), the discovery of a neural EEG biomarker of reward
sensitivity that predicts smoking cessation (Aim 2), and the discovery that varenicline is superior to bupropion in
reducing depressive symptoms while quitting and promoting smoking cessation for smokers with low reward
sensitivity (Aim 3). Major multi-investigator prevention projects include an NCI-funded preclinical consortium
(PREVENT), an NCI-funded clinical cancer prevention consortium (N01 Chemoprevention Consortium), 2
Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science programs, a U54 to study a genetically informed biomarker (nicotine
metabolite ratio) for smoking cessation, and an NRG R01 study of ovarian cancer biomarker modulation by
activity and diet. Future goals are to target early oncogenic drivers in cancer prevention trials, develop immune-
based cancer prevention strategies, combine energy balance and drug-based prevention strategies, develop
adaptive smoking cessation treatment algorithms to assign smokers to pharmacotherapy with the goal of
changing clinical practice, and reduce cancer incidence and mortality in Houston, the nation, and the world."

MD Anderson exists to “…eliminate cancer in Texas, the nation, and the world.” It achieves this mission by
operating in four integrated domains – research, clinical care, education, and prevention/control. Based upon its
state charter, state support, patient population, and its primary commitment to improving the health of Texans,
the institution defines the state of Texas as its primary catchment area. The Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE) component highlights the institution's key resources, relationships, and evidence-
based actions taken in priority areas to reduce Texans' cancer burden and associated risk factors. The
second most populous state in the country (28.3M residents), Texas is highly diverse and has the greatest
number of uninsured residents in the nation. Catchment area priorities include: tobacco use, obesity, ultraviolet
radiation, rising rates of hepatocellular cancer (HCC), delivery of HPV vaccination, and equitable delivery of
screening services for cervical and colorectal (CRC) cancer. MD Anderson's capacity to advance the health of
Texans is sustained through key investments in resources, such as implementation expertise to achieve
population level impact through the Cancer Prevention & Control Platform (CPCP), and research infrastructure
to advance community informed community based studies through the Center for Community-Engaged
Translational Research (CCETR). By activating its network of diverse relationships, including those with
educational systems, as well as community and faith-based organizations, MD Anderson amplifies its reach and
impact beyond its walls, enabling MD Anderson's connection to and partnership with the community. MD
Anderson views research and control actions as complementary activities that inform each other to perpetuate
a virtuous cycle to address the needs of Texans. To address identified priorities, MD Anderson leads an array of
initiatives dedicated to advancing research and community engagement as well as evidence-based actions to
improve public policy, professional and public education (knowledge dissemination), and community-oriented
service delivery beyond its direct delivery of patient care services. These efforts are stewarded through
engagement of a broad group of CCSG Research Program members and staff working collaboratively across
multiple offices, community-based organizations, and clinical partners. The aims of the COE component are:
Aim 1: To assess and monitor catchment area rates and trends as well as emerging evidence-based practices
in order to identify cancer-related needs and opportunities to address them.
Aim 2: To plan and prioritize research and control actions to commit MD Anderson's resources (infrastructure
and faculty expertise) and relationships and engage communities and partners.
Aim 3: To implement and evaluate evidence-based actions in policy, public and professional education, and
services to increase the use and impact of interventions that reduce the burden of cancer and associated risk
factors at the population level and improve outcomes in Texas and beyond."

domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial
cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy
subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13):
clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate
association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for
subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be
validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI
with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of
senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI
provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving
heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by
personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a
clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient
outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will
fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on
CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR."
10770526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CD4+ IL-17-producing T helper cells (Th17) are known drivers of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune
inflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS), yet not all Th17 cells drive disease. Indeed, two major Th17 subtypes
have been described in both mice and humans: homeostatic or non-pathogenic (npTh17) that maintain the
steady state in tissue and inflammatory or pathogenic Th17 (pTh17) that drive destructive tissue inflammation.
Importantly, npTh17 are precursors of pTh17 and IL-23 is known to be the switch factor for conversion of npTh17
to pTh17. However, the mechanisms by which IL-23 drives this conversion are not well understood. Identifying
these mechanisms will provide critical insight for the development of novel therapeutic interventions for MS.
Genetic variants in TCF7, the gene encoding the transcription factor TCF-1, have been associated with disease
susceptibility in MS in genome-wide association studies, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
Notably, TCF-1 has been implicated in Th17 biology, but its role remains unclear due to conflicting data
generated in models that have either defective T cell development or that study TCF-1 indirectly. Using mice that
conditionally delete Tcf7 only in mature T cells, and thus have normal T cell development, we have found that
TCF-1-deficient Th17 cells may not require IL-23R signaling for acquiring pathogenic potential. Indeed, we have
found that TCF-1 is differentially regulated in npTh17 and pTh17 in vivo and that IL-23 shuts down TCF-1
expression. Our preliminary data further uncover a putative regulatory circuit that links IL-23, TCF-1, and
endogenous glucocorticoid (GC) signaling. We have found that npTh17 are steroidogenic. They can produce
GCs, which in turn, sustain TCF-1 expression, oppose IL23R signaling, and restrain Th17 pathogenicity. In
contrast, IL-23 shuts down steroidogenesis in npTh17 cells. Accordingly, we hypothesize that a TCF-1-
glucocorticoid regulatory circuit determines IL-23-driven pathogenicity in Th17 cells. We have generated
several novel conditional knock-out mice with which we can study the role of TCF-1, the glucocorticoid receptor
(GR), and cell-intrinsic steroidogenesis specifically in mature T cells. We will use these tools to mechanistically
dissect this novel regulatory circuit. We propose the following aims: 1) Define the role of TCF-1 in opposing IL-
23-driven Th17 pathogenicity; 2) Determine how glucocorticoid signaling regulates TCF-1 expression, IL23R
signaling, and Th17 pathogenicity; and 3) Determine the role of cell-intrinsic steroidogenesis in opposing Th17
pathogenicity.
Our proposed investigation is highly clinically relevant given the association of genetic variants of TCF7 with
susceptibility to MS and the use of GCs to treat relapses in patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS)."
10795671,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance is an urgent public health problem and a threat to patient safety.
Antimicrobial use is the strongest risk factor for the emergence of antimicrobial resistance By reducing
unnecessary antimicrobial use and improving necessary use, antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are
an important tool in the battle against antimicrobial resistance. ASPs are mandated both in and outside VHA.
Significance: There is not a universally accepted metric to assess ASP success. A hospital-level metric,
known as the Standardized Antimicrobial Administration Ratio (SAAR), is being widely implemented across US
hospitals, including in VHA. However, the SAAR has not been validated and has several weaknesses,
including lack of patient-level risk adjustment and no consideration for antimicrobial spectrum of activity.
Innovation & Impact: This proposal will target a critical research gap by developing, refining and validating
novel metrics that address the limitations of the SAAR. These novel metrics include: 1) a risk-standardized
days of therapy (DOT) ratio (RSDTR), which differs from the SAAR in its adjustment for differences in patient
case-mix; 2) a Days of Antimicrobial Spectrum Coverage (DASC) score, which differs from the SAAR in its
capture of both antimicrobial use and spectrum of activity, and 3) a risk-standardized DASC. Through our aims,
we will assess 3 types of validity (construct, content and predictive) for the SAAR and the 3 novel metrics.
Specific Aims:
A1: Identify non-modifiable factors that contribute to appropriate variation in antimicrobial use across VHA
acute-care hospitals by evaluating potential patient-level, hospital-level, and environmental effects.
H1: Non-modifiable factors can be identified by consensus-building exercises and mathematical techniques.
A2: Evaluate whether hospitals that have implemented more robust stewardship processes, as measured by a
mandatory VHA survey, perform better on the SAAR and the three novel metrics.
H2: The association between the robustness of stewardship and a hospital's metric performance will be
strongest for the risk-standardized DASC score.
A3: Using qualitative methods, assess the content validity of the SAAR and the three novel metrics among key
stakeholders across ten hospitals, including high and low-performing sites.
H3: Key stakeholders across all sites will confirm the validity of the RSDTR and risk-standardized DASC and
will have concerns about the validity of metrics that do not involve patient-level risk-adjustment.
A4: Evaluate the longitudinal relationship between a hospital's performance on the four metrics and the
emergence of healthcare-associated antimicrobial resistance.
H4: The novel metrics will have a stronger association with future antimicrobial resistance than the SAAR.
Methodology: Our proposal will leverage both quantitative and qualitative methods. In Aim 1, we will use a
modified two-stage Delphi method, which will integrate data-driven and human-driven selection strategies, to
identify non-modifiable risk factors that should be used to risk-standardize DASC and also DOT (e.g. the
RSDTR metric). In Aim 2, we will use hospitals' responses to a mandatory survey to measure the association
between the intensity of stewardship activities and metric performance (construct validity). In Aim 3, we will
perform semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders to assess the content validity of the
four metrics. In Aim 4, we will leverage 17 years of VHA data to determine whether a hospital's performance on
each metric is associated with the future development of antimicrobial resistance (predictive validity).
Next Steps/Implementation: Any metric we validate would inform health policy and could be incorporated into
our team's existing stewardship dashboard. Our findings could be used in a multicenter, audit-and-feedback
trial that leverages the dashboard and the validated metric(s) to improve inpatient antimicrobial use."
10831840,"Cognitive decline is a common consequence of aging and neuropsychiatric conditions that can lead to dementia
and impairment in everyday functional activities, which may in turn prompt institutional placement and loss of
independence. Veterans are at increased risk of cognitive decline, and the VA is now providing health care to
surging numbers of older Veterans who report significant cognitive complaints, difficulties with everyday
functioning, and concerns about impending dementia. Treatments to reverse or reduce the consequences of
decline are urgently needed. Our study team has previously developed and validated protocols for
Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) interventions that train cognitive strategies and habits relevant to
attention, learning/memory, and executive functioning to improve everyday functioning in the real world. Despite
clear, immediate, CCT-based gains in cognitive and everyday functioning in Veterans with multiple causes of
cognitive impairment, questions remain about the long-term durability of CCT. Additionally, while systematic
reviews and meta-analyses indicate that booster intervention sessions can help maintain treatment gains, these
have not yet been developed for CCT.
The proposed CDA provides a golden opportunity to evaluate both the long-term durability of CCT and to develop
and pilot test the effects of booster treatment. Specific aims are 1) to evaluate the durability of CCT at 24 months
in the areas of cognitive performance, performance-based functional capacity, subjective functioning, and quality
of life, 2) to develop a series of CCT booster intervention modules focused on aspects of cognition and everyday
function, and 3) to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CCT booster intervention to establish
feasibility and acceptability. We will recruit Veterans aged 55 or older who previously participated in a VA Merit
study of CCT for older Veterans with Mild Cognitive Impairment [CSRD: I01CX001592; PI: Twamley].
The candidate, Dr. Jacqueline Maye, is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the VA San Diego Healthcare System.
Her long-term career goal is to be an independent, VA-funded investigator focused on improving cognitive health
and function for older Veterans. Training objectives center on cognitive rehabilitation concepts and research
practices, RCTs for older Veterans with cognitive impairments, advanced longitudinal techniques, and
professional development. The proposed study complements these goals, with a mentorship team that includes
experts in aging, cognitive rehabilitation, intervention and RCT design, and advanced statistical methodology.
Project findings will be critical to the candidate’s mission to advance cognitive rehabilitation science and deliver
long-term, sustained benefits to Veterans through CCT. Results will inform post-CDA research goals to
implement boosters widely with future CCT participants."

What are the mechanisms by which we selectively remember sensory cues associated with salient outcomes?
Salient sensory experiences activate distributed patterns of neurons in regions including sensory cortex,
amygdala, and hippocampus. The linking of neural representations of cues and outcomes is believed to occur
both online, during the sensory experiences, and offline, during joint reactivation of cue- and outcome-related
patterns of neurons during subsequent quiet periods. Both the online and offline aspects of cue-outcome
association learning have been posited to involve co-activation of neuromodulators that project to these
distributed brain regions, which may facilitate neural plasticity via actions on intracellular signaling in neuronal
dendrites. We have recently developed methods to visualize these network, cellular and subcellular
processes across days and weeks in lateral visual association cortex (LVAC) of behaving mice
learning an operant Go-NoGo visual discrimination task. LVAC is a key hub that links the hippocampus,
sensory cortex, and amygdala. Silencing of either online or offline activity in LVAC perturbs long-term memory
consolidation and recall of cue-outcome associations. We previously found that LVAC neuron cue responses
are highly plastic across learning and that LVAC is necessary for performance of our task. We showed that the
same distinct pattern of neurons that was activated by a given visual cue was subsequently reactivated for
~100-200 ms during quiet waking, with higher reactivation rates during early learning and for salient food-
predicting vs. neutral cues. Rates of food-cue but not neutral cue reactivation predicted next-day improvements
in performance. Accordingly, reactivations involving ensembles of neurons encoding both the food cue and
reward predicted strengthening of next-day functional connectivity of participating neurons, providing a
potential cortical substrate for associative learning. This proposal seeks to define the neuromodulatory,
signaling, and network mechanisms underlying the above findings, and their causal role in learning. A
brain region that densely innervated LVAC and implicated in salience, plasticity, and memory consolidation is
the locus coeruleus (LC). Both online and offline LC activity guides which salient experiences are stored.
Noradrenaline released by LC neurons can act on beta-adrenergic receptors, thereby boosting cyclic AMP
(cAMP), a second messenger that facilitates synaptic plasticity. Thus, we hypothesize that increased
neuromodulatory input from LC to LVAC during salient sensory experiences (Aim 1) drives increases in cAMP
signaling in LVAC neurons (Aim 2), and biases subsequent offline reactivation of neurons activated during
these experiences, in order to modify next-day changes in network activity and behavioral performance (Aims
1-2). We then examine electrophysiological correlates of offline cortical reactivations and their causal role in
facilitating network changes and learning (Aim 3). These cellular/subcellular investigations of neural activity
and signaling in vivo will address links between neuromodulation, offline reactivation and associative plasticity."
10847418,"Schizophrenia is a severe and heterogeneous mental disorder that impacts most domains of function including
behavior, cognition, and emotion. Recent models have highlighted important alterations of the emotion brain
networks in schizophrenia that contribute to schizophrenia symptoms, like paranoia and delusions. To date, the
studies of emotion in schizophrenia have primarily focused on fear processing and have shown heightened
amygdala responses to neutral stimuli and altered amygdala-prefrontal cortex connectivity. However, recent
research suggests that another brain region—the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST)—may play a
critical role in anxiety and that BNST-mediated anxiety is distinct from amygdala-mediated fear. The RDoC’s
Negative Valence System recognizes this fear-anxiety distinction and has separate constructs for Response to
Acute Threat (amygdala) and Response to Potential Harm (BNST). To our knowledge, the BNST has yet to be
examined in individuals with schizophrenia. Using methods pioneered by our lab to study the human BNST, we
have collected preliminary data in schizophrenia. Our pilot data provides initial evidence for BNST connectivity
differences in both response to unpredictable threat, a measure of the response to potential harm construct,
and during a resting state in individuals with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls. Further, we found
evidence that BNST alterations in schizophrenia differ for those who do or do not have comorbid anxiety.
Individuals with schizophrenia and anxiety disorders demonstrated stronger connectivity between BNST and
multiple brain regions involved in threat detection, uncertainty, and anxiety relative to those with schizophrenia
and no anxiety disorder. The current study will investigate BNST connectivity in three groups: individuals with
schizophrenia with a comorbid anxiety disorder (SZ+ANX), individuals with schizophrenia without a comorbid
anxiety disorder (SZ-ANX), and healthy controls (HC). We hypothesize that individuals with schizophrenia will
have altered BNST connectivity in response to unpredictable threat and altered BNST intrinsic connectivity
relative to HC. In addition we predict that SZ+ANX group will show BNST hyperconnectivity relative to SZ-
ANX. We will test these hypotheses with three specific aims. (1) Investigate BNST connectivity in response to
unpredictable threat in individuals with schizophrenia; (2) Determine whether there are differences in BNST
intrinsic connectivity in individuals with schizophrenia; (3) Test for relationships among BNST connectivity,
stress responses (skin conductance and cortisol), and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia. Given the
prevalence of anxiety in schizophrenia, BNST alterations within schizophrenia are likely and may shed new
light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying emotion alterations in schizophrenia. The results from the
proposed study can provide a foundation for future studies of emotion in schizophrenia, determine whether
there are neurobiological differences in anxiety subgroups, and guide the development of novel
neuroscientifically-informed treatments."

With the rapid acceleration of the aging population and repeated failures to find a pharmacological cure for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), it is of paramount importance to identify modifiable physical attributes that are most
likely to attenuate cognitive and neural decline in older adults. Individual studies have demonstrated that
mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscle strength/power are associated with cognition among older
adults. However, because these physical attributes have been studied in isolation, it remains unknown which of
these attributes are most critical for successful cognitive aging and brain maintenance (keeping the brain
young). Our long-term goal is to develop a precision medicine model of cognitive aging; that is, to identify
which physical attributes are associated with specific cognitive functions and implement individually tailored
exercise programs to optimize those cognitive abilities among older adults. Our overall objective in the current
proposal is to directly examine differential contributions of mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, and muscle
strength/power metrics to current cognitive abilities, brain health, and longitudinal cognitive decline. Our central
hypothesis is that these physical attributes account for unique variance in cognition, but that their relative
predictive abilities will differ within specific cognitive domains and neural networks. Using gold-standard
assessments of mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength/power, cognition, and brain structure and
function (magnetic resonance imaging; MRI) in young, middle-aged, and older adults, we will pursue the
following aims: 1) Determine the contribution of physical attributes to cognition, with a specific emphasis on
episodic memory and executive function, among older adults. 2) Determine the contribution of physical
attributes to cortical thickness (T1-weighted MRI), white matter microstructure (diffusion-weighted MRI) and
brain function (functional MRI) among older adults. 3) Identify which physical attributes predict cognitive
decline over a 2.5-year period in older adults and whether polygenic risk scores for AD moderate the
association between physical attributes and cognitive decline. We will examine which modifiable physical
attributes, including functional aspects of the motor system, predict cognitive decline among older adults.
Outcome data from this proposal will impact the development of lifestyle interventions for optimization of
cognitive performance among older adults, as the study will provide critical knowledge to optimize future
exercise intervention studies aimed at mitigating age- and Alzheimer’s disease-related cognitive and neural
decline. Moreover, we will examine whether physical attribute-brain-cognition associations are age dependent.
The current proposal is well-suited for the mission of the National Institutes of Aging, as we propose to
examine modifiable physical attributes that will maximize high quality-of-life years and independent functioning
(via maintenance of cognitive and brain health) prior to mortality."

Robust and tightly regulated DNA repair is critical to maintain genome stability and prevent disease development.
Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into chromatin that has a profound, yet not well understood regulatory influence on
DNA repair, replication and genome maintenance. There is a fundamental gap in understanding how DNA repair
pathways are regulated and coordinated within structurally diverse chromatin, and across the heterogeneous
genomic landscape. The HELLS (Helicase Lymphoid Specific) is a poorly understood chromatin-associated
protein, with an emerging new role in genome maintenance. Mouse HELLS is essential for gametogenesis and
proper development of the immune system. Mutations in human HELLS cause severe immunodeficiency
syndrome ICF (Immunodeficiency Centromeric Instability Facial anomalies). Despite substantial progress in
understanding the molecular functions of the mammalian HELLS in DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling,
its role in DNA repair and genome maintenance is poorly understood and remains elusive. The unresolved
questions remain whether HELLS regulates multiple DNA repair pathways, and whether it has specialized roles
in the repair and maintenance of a distinct genomic loci or domains. We have established and validated fungal
model, Neurospora crassa to advance the fundamental understanding of HELLS-mediated mechanisms of
genome stability. Our studies reveal a new, previously unrecognized link between HELLS proteins and cellular
responses to DNA alkylation damage in fungal and human cells. We hypothesize that HELLS protects cells form
alkylation-induced toxicity and plays important roles in the repair and stability of the constitutive heterochromatin
domains. This hypothesis is founded based on a strong preliminary data in the fungal model Neurospora and in
human cells demonstrating that cells deficient in HELLS exhibit sensitivity to DNA alkylation damage and are
deficient in the repair of the constitutive heterochromatin. In addition, we discovered that loss of fungal WDR76
protein in HELLS mutant cells leads to the synthetic rescue of the alkylation sensitivity phenotype, implying that
WDR76 acts as genetic suppressor of HELLS deficiency. In Aim 1 we will determine the role of fungal and human
HELLS remodelers in the repair of alkylation DNA damage. In Aim 2 we will define precise genomic and
chromatin contexts that depend on HELLS for genome maintenance. In Aim 3 we will determine the functional
relationship between HELLS and WDR76, a WD40 protein implicated in response to DNA alkylation. Successful
completion of the proposed research will define HELLS-mediated mechanisms of genome maintenance, and
identify additional regulators and pathways cooperating with HELLS in protecting the cells from detrimental
consequences of genotoxic stress. These studies will provide important insights into the origin of the disease-
causing chromosomal rearrangements and breaks found in many human diseases, including the ICF syndrome."
10863995,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a spectroscopic technique that
measures the absorption of energy by unpaired electrons and is used to monitor interactions with the local
molecular environment. These unpaired electrons can naturally occur during the catalytic process of an enzyme
or be engineered using site-directed spin labeling. Studying these paramagnetic states in detail is critical for
understanding the protein structure–function relationship of the unpaired electrons to coordination sphere and
secondary structures of the protein. In this proposal, I focus on three technical and method developments at X-
band (nominally 9.5 GHz) that will significantly improve EPR spectroscopy for the biomedical research
community. I will (i) enhance the EPR sensitivity of the self-resonant microhelix for protein single-crystal EPR of
small to medium-sized (0.1–3 nl) crystals, (ii) establish true free induction decay detected EPR for volume-limited
frozen samples (85 nl), and (iii) develop a new resonator, the self-resonant microspiral, for advanced time-
domain continuous-wave (CW) experiments with microfluidic (500 nl) sample handling. First, enhancements to
a key enabling technology, the self-resonant microhelix, will improve EPR sensitivity by an order of magnitude
due to application of an innovative matching circuit and cryogenic low-noise amplifier. To improve adoption of
this prototype, I will implement a more standard workflow for protein crystal handling, including a computer-
controlled goniometer. The prototype will be designed to easily integrate into a commercial X-band pulse
spectrometer. Because the self-resonant microhelix has a measured resonator efficiency parameter of
3.2 mT/W1/2, which is greater than 5 times that of commercially available resonators, the power required for a
typical 80 ns pulse is reduced by 3 orders of magnitude (from 45 W to just 43 mW). Reduced incident power and
implementation of an innovative 3-port transmission line coupling scheme with an onboard cryogenic low-noise
amplifier will establish a resonator deadtime less than 5 ns. By leveraging these characteristics, I can develop a
new spectrometer prototype for true free induction decay detected EPR, which will drastically improve the EPR
signal intensity of biological samples and allow for advanced pulse methodologies that are currently not possible
with commercial X-band EPR spectrometer design. Finally, I will introduce a new micro-resonator, the self-
resonant microspiral, which will increase the concentration sensitivity for CW EPR by a factor of 70 compared
with the microhelix, transforming microfluidic EPR into a viable tool for drug discovery. The self-resonant
microspiral enables a new incipient adiabatic passage experiment, pioneered here, that monitors changes of T1
and T2 with changes of the microenvironment of the unpaired electron. This experiment is supported by new
sample acquisition methodology that increases CW and adiabatic rapid scan sensitivity by an order of magnitude
for the same measurement time. In total, these key enabling technologies will further the adoption of nano-EPR,
where performing EPR experiments on volume-limited samples less than 500 nl at X-band becomes practical."
10789966,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application aims to build on our recent discoveries of olfactory “gating” of visual attraction in Aedes aegypti
mosquitoes and determine the role of color vision in host and nectar selection. Without vision, mosquitoes
cannot track odors, locate hosts, or find mates. Vision is a critical sensory modality involved in long-range
olfactory search behaviors and near-host behaviors involved in landing and biting. Despite this potential
importance, little is known about vision in anthropophilic mosquitoes and the neural bases of these behaviors.
Mosquitoes can see a host from 2-15 m, and our recent findings show that odor “turns on” their visual attraction
to hosts, thereby playing a critical role by linking long-distance odor tracking with short-range behaviors near the
host. Our work also demonstrated that mosquitoes are sensitive to wavelengths reflected from human skin.
However, we lack an understanding of how odor sensitizes the visual system, and the visual preferences of
diverse anthropophilic mosquitoes. We have developed new tools to examine olfactory-visual integration,
including new Aedes GCaMP6s mosquito lines, the generation of opsin knockout lines, and biogenic amine
receptor mutants. This proposal builds on our preliminary findings that demonstrate the importance of color
vision and neuromodulators in olfactory-visual integration in mosquitoes. Using semi-field and behavioral
assays, calcium imaging in tethered flying mosquitoes, and molecular-genetic approaches, we propose to study
the color preferences of mosquitoes and how odor modulates visual neurons. Aim 1 will allow us to characterize
the colors (wavelengths) that attract different anthropophilic mosquito species and identify the odors that turn on
visual search behaviors. In Aim 2, using Aedes aegypti, we will determine the neural mechanisms by which
odors turn on visual search behaviors, and identify the rhodopsins that detect important wavelengths. Our
preliminary results indicate that octopamine is critical for olfactory-visual integration. We will generate cell-
specific knockout of the octopamine receptor to determine how olfactory-visual behaviors are compromised. In
parallel, we will mutate specific long- and short-wavelength rhodopsins to suppress attraction to colors indicating
hosts or nectar sources. We will also use new GCaMP6s lines to record from visual neurons in the mosquito
brain and characterize how odor modulates those neurons. Aim 3 will test the wavelengths and visual features
(motion, object size) that mosquitoes find attractive, and test them in new trap designs in semi-field trials.
While there has been extensive work on olfaction in mosquitoes, our work emphasizes that color vision also
plays a key role. Olfactory-visual integration is vital in diverse insect vectors, including tsetse flies and kissing
bugs. We suggest that our proposed experiments provide a basic framework for understanding how these cues
influence haematophagous insects. Furthermore, results from this work will provide information on attractive
visual lures, and motivate the identification of molecular targets to cripple visual-olfactory behaviors."
10635461,"Background: Transgender people experience discord between their gender identity and birth sex, defined as
gender dysphoria. Gender-affirming treatments (GATs) are medically necessary treatments to reduce gender
dysphoria. However, among transgender Veterans (trans Vets) who desire GATs, not much is known about
barriers and facilitators to accessing and receiving GATs in VA and VA Community Care (CC). To ensure
effective and equitable GAT access for trans Vets, it is critical to understand: [1] GATs trans Vets receive and
where they receive them, [2] barriers, including social determinants of health (SDOH) barriers that are highly
prevalent among trans Vets, and facilitators associated with desired GAT receipt in VA and CC, [3] how
barriers and facilitators influence GAT access and desire, and [4] how to improve GAT access in VA and CC.
Significance: This study addresses the 2022 HSR&D priority areas of Access to Care, Health Equity/SDOH,
MISSION Act, and research gap of underserved LGBTQ+ Veterans. It is also a high priority for our operational
partners in VA LGBTQ+ Health Program, Pharmacy Benefits Management, Office of Integrated Veteran Care,
and Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention. Knowledge gained from this study will ensure that GAT
delivery in the VA is patient-centered and is responsive to the lived realities and needs of trans Vets.
Innovation and Impact: This study will be the first to characterize the GATs received in VA and/or CC to
understand how VA and CC are balanced in terms of delivering GATs. This study will also provide novel data
on trans Vet experiences related to GAT access in CC, which will be likely relevant to other underserved
Veterans accessing CC. Further, it will be innovative in providing data on services and resources used by trans
Vets to address barriers that influence GAT access. This will be key to developing patient-centered
implementation strategies to improve GAT access in VA and CC.
Specific Aims: We propose a sequential explanatory mixed method study whose aims are to:
Aim 1. Characterize the GATs received by trans Vets in VA and/or CC (VA/CC)
Aim 2. Identify barriers and facilitators associated with desired GAT receipt in VA and CC
Aim 3: Understand trans Vet experiences related to GAT access in VA and CC.
Methodology: Database Aim 1: We will expand our VA cohort of 9,608 trans Vets (IIR 17-238) from 2006-18
to the data available at the time of funding. We will add CC data to determine the types of GATs received by
trans Vets in VA and/or CC. Survey Aim 2: We will survey a national sample of trans Vets identified from Aim
1. Among trans Vets who desire GATs, we will determine SDOH barriers, other barriers, and facilitators
associated with desired GAT receipt. Among trans Vets who did not desire GATs, we will determine reasons
for not wanting GATs. Qualitative Aim 3: From Aim 2 participants, we will recruit a purposive sample of trans
Vets who received all desired GAT(s), who received some desired GAT(s), and who received no desired
GAT(s). We will also recruit a national sample of LGBTQ+ Veteran Care Coordinators. We will seek to
understand experiences and perspectives on GAT access in VA and CC, how SDOH barriers, other barriers,
and facilitators influence GAT access and desire, and how to improve GAT access in VA and CC. Informed by
study findings and in partnership with our Stakeholder Advisory Group, we will develop patient-centered
implementation strategies to mitigate barriers and enhance facilitators to improve GAT access in VA and CC.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will conduct a follow-up hybrid implementation effectiveness study to deploy
these strategies to address barriers that impede GAT access and improve GAT access in VA and CC."
10896908,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Maternal nutrition plays an indispensable role in fetal and infant brain development. Accordingly,
nutritional deficiencies during this critical window can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet, exactly how
nutrients contribute to the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing neurodevelopment is largely unknown.
Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) consumed from fatty fish,
accumulates in the phospholipids of cell membranes and is required for brain growth and maturation. Although
DHA can be biosynthesized, offspring primarily rely on maternal DHA to meet their needs. Importantly, a global
shift to Western-style diets has also led to decreased DHA intakes, raising concerns about the
neurodevelopmental consequences for offspring.
 Humans with low DHA status display white matter defects and cognitive and behavioral deficits.
Furthermore, DHA-deficient animals exhibit pro-inflammatory responses from microglia, the brain’s resident
immune cells. Microglia also regulate the development and elimination of myelin, the axon insulator that
increases the speed of nerve impulses and gives white matter its color. Indeed, novel work from our lab has
shown that microglia phagocytose excess myelin during normal development. However, it is not known whether
the neuroinflammatory and microglial consequences of low DHA status culminate in the abnormal regulation of
myelination.
 Using a zebrafish model, I will generate DHA-depleted offspring via genetic and maternal diet strategies.
By employing powerful single-cell transcriptomic and in vivo imaging techniques, I will investigate whether low
DHA status alters: Inflammatory signaling and phagocytosis-related gene expression in microglia (Aim 1); myelin
development and morphology (Aim 2); and the microglial phagocytosis of myelin sheaths (Aim 3). This work
could reveal a cellular mechanism by which low DHA status leads to white matter defects and provide insight
into nutritional strategies that optimize infant health and prevent neurodevelopmental disorders.
 Through my proposed training at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, I will gain the
conceptual, technical, and professional skills necessary to establish my independent research niche at the
intersection of nutrition and developmental neurobiology."

Our current understanding of mechanisms underlying visceral hypersensitivity, such as that associated with
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), remains rudimentary. Importantly, treating this and other functional gut disorders
is limited, with a clear need for alternative treatment options. For the growing population afflicted by IBS, GI
hypersensitivity and pain persist long after signs of tissue injury have resolved. Unlike other intestinal disorders,
patients with IBS are hypersensitive with a lower pain threshold following colonic rectal distention (CRD) testing.
Identifying the molecular and cellular components that mediate both the acute and persistent phases of visceral
pain is a critical first step in understanding how environmental and endogenous factors produce long-term
changes in the nervous system or associated tissues to engender chronic pain syndromes. In this new multi-PI
application, we have taken a team-science approach and a multifaceted strategy designed to maximize the
relevance of our pre-clinical basic research discoveries.
Enterochromaffin (EC) cells are key sensory cells in the intestinal epithelium that release serotonin onto primary
sensory nerve fibers, thereby evoking a sensation of discomfort and pain in response to luminal irritants, such
as bacterial metabolites, inflammatory agents, or ingested chemicals. Our group recently established that EC
cell-mucosal afferent signaling is a major mediator of visceral pain. We also show that the strength of this signal
differs in males versus females. We will leverage our new colitis-free chemogenetic model of visceral
hypersensitivity to zero in on the contribution of EC cells to visceral pain and identify molecular mechanisms
through which these cells modulate the activity of nearby sensory nerve fibers. We will also ask how estrogen
signaling contributes to the strong female bias that is characteristic of human IBS.
Our team brings expertise in neurophysiology, pharmacology, visceral tissue anatomy, sex differences, and
hormone signaling in female physiology and an unusually wide-ranging set of innovative approaches to tackle a
prevalent gut-brain disorder."

Pain is an independent prognostic factor for survival in head and neck cancer (HNC). These cancers can be
broadly divided into those that are induced by infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV positive) and
those that are mutationally driven (HPV negative). The onset of orofacial pain may signal the pre-cancerous to
cancerous transition as well as the recurrence of disease, suggesting a predictive value. Thus, pain is a
significant co-morbidity in HNC. Despite this, well-established guidelines for HNC pain management are lacking
and opioids remain at the forefront of treatment. Given its influence on patient survival and the widespread risk
of opioid dependence, additional therapies are needed to address HNC pain. The presence of neurons within
solid tumors is now widely accepted. Our preliminary data show that HPV negative tumors are significantly more
innervated than their HPV positive counterparts. Moreover, we show that intra-tumoral neurons are
transcriptionally and functionally different from normal (naïve) neurons. In Aim 1, we will test how HPV status
and sex influence these characteristics of intra-tumoral neurons and their effects on cancer pain. We have
previously published that tumor-released small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) lure neurons to the tumor bed. Our
preliminary analysis of sEV miRNAs suggest that these cargo molecules directly impact tumor innervation. In
addition, we also show that expression of HNC oncogenes influences the packaging of miRNAs in sEVs. In Aim
2, we will test the effect of sEV miRNAs on cancer pain in vivo. In addition, given the presence of neurons within
tumor tissues, we electrophysiologically assessed activity in HNC patient tumor slices. We found that HPV
negative tumors harbor a significantly higher electrical activity than those that are HPV positive. We also show
that this activity can be pharmacologically attenuated with pain-targeting drugs (e.g. lidocaine). In Aim 3, we will
use a pain assessment patient questionnaire and matched patient tumors to determine whether tumoral electrical
activity correlates with patient reported pain. We will also test whether drugs that attenuate pain also function to
slow/block tumor growth in vivo. Together, the outcomes of these studies will define that intra-tumoral neurons
and tumor-released sEVs as critical drivers of HNC pain. Moreover, we will have identified nerve targeting drugs
that can attenuate tumor growth and improve survival. These findings will support future clinical trials testing
these targets and drugs for the control of cancer pain."
10877745,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is caused by pathogenic variants of the last enzyme of heme biosynthesis,
which produces life-long, painful cutaneous sensitivity to light. In EPP, the light-sensitive molecule
protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) accumulates in erythrocytes and secondarily in the plasma and the liver. In addition to
photosensitivity, EPP can result in anemia, gallstones, and chronic liver disease, and 2-5% patients develop
rapidly progressive cholestatic liver failure that is fatal without liver transplantation. The approval of new
therapeutics in EPP has been greatly hindered by the lack of quantitative clinical trial endpoints. While the
Food and Drug Administration recently approved one therapy that helps to prevent EPP-related
photosensitivity, no disease-modifying therapy is available for EPP. The objective of this study is to develop
methods to quantitatively measure light sensitivity in EPP and to understand the genetic basis for differences in
light sensitivity among patients. Light sensitivity will be measured by the combination of light dosimetry,
transcutaneous PPIX fluorometry, and daily text symptom surveys. The genetic basis for differences in light
sensitivity among patients will be characterized by performing whole exome sequencing and a genotyping
array in EPP patients possessing the same FECH genotype and large discordances in light sensitivity and/or
PPIX level. First, polygenic risk scores that were developed in large datasets will be applied to the genetic data
of this selected patient population. Next, disease-modifying coding variants will be identified in the exome
sequences, followed by in vitro validation. This project could lead to (1) methods to predict and prevent
photosensitivity in EPP thus improving quality of life, (2) quantitative endpoints for clinical trials facilitating the
approval of new therapies, and (3) a better understanding of the modulators of light sensitivity in EPP, which
could lead to novel therapeutics. This research will be performed by Dr. Amy Dickey, an Instructor of Medicine
at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. She will receive first-rate training in statistics,
epidemiology, clinical trial design, and genetic analysis. Furthermore, she will be exceptionally mentored by Dr.
David Christiani, an expert in genetic and environmental epidemiology, and co-mentored by Dr. Mark Fleming,
an expert in heme metabolism and rare disease genetic analysis. She will perform her research in a world-
renowned academic center with all required resources available to her. Dr. Dickey's goal is to become a
physician-scientist in patient-oriented porphyria research. This K23 award will provide her with the training and
mentorship to achieve independence and apply for her first R01."
10836404,"Background: Each year approximately 1.7 million occur in the United States causing significant morbidity and
nearly 100,000 deaths. Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become the most common healthcare-
associated infection (HAI) in U.S. hospitals causing half a million infections and 30,000 deaths. CDI ranges
from asymptomatic colonization, mild to severe diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, colonic
perforation, and death. Risk factors for CDI include older age, comorbidity, hospitalization, exposure to others
with CDI, and antibiotic use. The increasing incidence of C. difficile and emergence of new epidemic strain has
resulted in outbreaks in healthcare settings. Prevention of healthcare-onset (HO) CDI has quickly become a
priority for most hospitals. Hospital prevention measures are limited to modifiable risk factors (i.e., prudent
antibiotic use and limiting exposure to C. difficile). Hospital exposure to C. difficile can occur directly (i.e.,
hands or clothing of healthcare workers) or indirectly (i.e., environmental surfaces or shared equipment) so
infection prevention measures focus on healthcare worker hand hygiene, healthcare worker barrier precautions
(i.e., use of gowns and gloves) and cleaning and disinfection of the hospital environment and reusable medical
equipment. However, these interventions are limited to symptomatic patients who test positive for CDI.
Asymptomatic patients serve as a reservoir for cross contamination, but microbiological screening for
asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile is not routinely performed in healthcare. Gloving for all patient contacts
may interrupt transmission from asymptomatic patients colonized with C. difficile.
Objectives: The overall purpose of the proposed study is to determine the effectiveness of healthcare worker
use of gloves for all patient contact for reducing acquisition of C. difficile and hospital-onset CDI in inpatient
hospital units. The main objective of the study is to compare the effects of universal gloving for all patient
contact to the current standard of care (i.e., glove and gown only for known CDI cases). The specific aims are
1) Compare the effects of universal gloving for all patient contact to the current standard of care on C. difficile
acquisition rates in hospitalized patients; 2) Compare the effects of universal gloving compared to standard of
care gloving on CDI rates, other healthcare-associated infections, 30-day mortality and unit length of stay; 3)
Evaluate intervention fidelity, the cost and stakeholder experiences.
Methods: The study will be a cluster randomized trial (CRT) in ten inpatient VA hospital units. In the pre-
intervention period we will conduct preparatory work including recruiting hospitals, training research assistants,
securing IRB approval, identifying current practices, finalizing monitoring and observation plans and measuring
baseline C. difficile acquisition rates. This will be followed by an intervention period executing the CRT in which
hospital units will be randomized either to implement barrier precautions for all patient contacts or continue
standard care (i.e., barrier precautions for patients with known CDI). The intervention will consist of all
healthcare workers (nurses, providers, respiratory therapist, radiology and laboratory technicians, etc.) utilizing
gloves for all patient contacts in the units that are randomized to receive the intervention. The non-intervention
units will follow standard of care which consists of healthcare workers following barrier precautions (i.e., gloves
and gowns) only for patients with known CDI and other antibiotic-resistant organisms (e.g., MRSA). The unit of
analysis is the ICU, since data are collected at the level of the unit. Monthly data will be collected from all
participating sites including C. difficile acquisition and infection rates, mortality, length of stay, barrier
precaution compliance and end-user perceptions.
Impact: The anticipated impact on Veterans’ healthcare is primarily the reduction of C. difficile acquisition and
subsequent infection and its associated morbidity, mortality and costs. If found to be effective, the results will
change the paradigm for CDI prevention in healthcare settings."

Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), like all primate lentiviruses possesses the ability to infect
non-dividing cells by engaging with components of the nuclear pore complex and mediating the
nuclear translocation of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) for subsequently integration
into the host cell genome. The viral capsid protein (CA) interacts with numerous host factors
involving constituents of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to accomplish the process of nuclear
import. Unfortunately, the exact mechanism by which HIV-1 translocates through the nuclear pore
complex remains one of the least understood steps of the viral life cycle. In addition, recent
evidences supporting the notion of NPCs being more heterogeneous than previously thought
further confounds this situation. We have developed an inducible nuclear pore blockade that
allows the rate of nuclear import of functional, infectious viral genomes to be monitored in any
relevant cells types. Using this technique, we observe that certain CA mutants are insensitive to
a Nup62 mediated nuclear pore blockade in cells which potently block infection by wild type CA,
demonstrating that HIV-1 can utilize distinct nuclear import pathways during infection. In this
application, we will determine the degree to which NPC are heterogeneous and map the specific
nuclear pore constituents that makeup the NPCs utilized by HIV-1 during nuclear entry. With our
nuclear pore blockade, we now have the capability to block NPCs using different nuclear pore
constituents. As such, this application aims to define and visualize the specific nuclear pore
constituents that interact and mediate the nuclear import of HIV-1 and how specific NPC usage
affects viral integration in target cells. Collectively this application would close critical gaps to our
understanding in to the nuclear import of HIV-1."

Propagation of calcium (Ca2+) signals to the mitochondria through the Ca2+ uniporter has long been considered
central to neuronal function. The discovery of the molecular components of the uniporter including the Ca2+
sensing regulator MICU1, was followed by the identification of many MICU1 loss-of-function patients who display
progressive neurological disorder, dominated by motor and learning impairments, which were recapitulated in
mouse models created by us and others. Emerging evidence indicates that acute MICU1 proteolytic degradation
by YME1L also occurs during hypoxia, suggesting that dysregulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis may
also play a role in ischemia/stroke. However, the neuronal pathogenesis associated with MICU1 deficiency and,
more broadly, the role of uniporter regulation in healthy neurons, remain poorly understood. MICU1 forms dimers
with its paralogs, MICU2 and MICU3, and with itself. MICU2 has also been linked to human neurological
impairments but is scarce in adult neurons, whereas MICU3 is abundant in adult brain. Our central hypothesis
is that control of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake by MICU1/2/3 is essential for coordinating mitochondrial function with
synaptic activity. This control also prevents mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and oxidant dysregulation that lead to
neuronal stress. Further, we postulate dynamic tuning of neuronal MICU-dependent gatekeeping: during
development—by a switch from primarily MICU1-MICU2 to MICU1-MICU3 dimers during early life—and under
hypoxic stress, by specific proteolytic degradation of MICU1, with potentially pathogenic consequences. To test
these ideas, we will use a neuron-specific MICU1 knockout mouse which we found to display neurodegeneration
characterized by mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, altered mitochondrial and neuronal ultrastructure, and motor and
cognitive impairments. We have also generated mice with MICU2 and MICU3 loss and have obtained MICU1
and MICU2 patient-derived cells. We have set up advanced functional imaging and large volume 3D
ultrastructure capacities. Thus, we are well positioned to study the neuronal pathogenesis associated with the
loss of each or multiple MICU isoforms. In Aim#1 we will test the hypothesis that neurons derived from MICU1,
MICU2 or MICU3-deficient mice and MICU1 and MICU2-deficient patient fibroblast-derived neurons have distinct
impairments in Ca2+ signaling, mitochondrial dynamics and synaptic vesicle release. In Aim#2 we will test if
neuronal MICU1/2/3 loss promotes mitochondrial oxidant production and oxidant-mediated cell injury. The
results will help to decide if oxidants are relevant to MICU-linked neuronal/brain injury. In Aim#3 we will test the
hypothesis that the relative abundance of the different MICU isoforms is dynamic in neurons during development,
and the loss of each isoform specifically affects neuroanatomy and brain function primarily in the motor areas
and the hippocampus. In Aim#4 we will test if ischemia-reperfusion induces YME1L-mediated turnover of MICU1
to promote mitochondrial Ca2+ overload injury and to sensitize the uniporter to inhibitors. These studies are
expected to decide if MICU1 loss is a pathogenic component and therapy-modifying factor in brain hypoxia."
10862729,"We seek to understand the regulatory mechanisms that control the movements of mitochondria
in cells. A protein complex that includes milton, Miro, and the kinesin-1 heavy chain (KHC) is
essential for mitochondrial transport in neurons. Miro resides at the central hub to allow multiple
cellular signals to control mitochondrial motility. These signals include mitophagy, calcium,
hypoxia, and nutrient availability etc. Additionally, and most relevant to this proposal, we have
obtained exciting preliminary results demonstrating that a novel machinery spanning both the
mitochondrial outer and inner membranes–the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging
(MIB) complex, stabilizes Miro and regulates mitochondrial motility. This new discovery and our
past work raise a burning question at the intersection of fundamental cell biology and
neurobiology: How these discrete Miro-pathways functionally coordinate or converge on
mitochondrial integrity in response to various stimuli and stresses? In this proposal, we will probe
these questions using classical cell biological and neurobiological approaches combined with a
powerful genetic tool (fruit flies) for functional validation. Aim 1: To dissect the functional
significance of the MIB-Miro complex. Aim 2: To determine the nature of Miro interaction
with its binding partners. Aim 3: To explore the interplay of the regulatory signals and
machineries of Miro."
10844429,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current HIV antiretroviral treatment successfully controls viral replication and has transformed HIV-infection from
a fatal illness to a manageable chronic condition. However, despite suppression of viral replication during
treatment, studies have shown that pools of latent viral reservoirs remain detectable, which fuel viral rebound
when antiviral suppression treatment is interrupted. These viral reservoirs are established almost immediately
upon infection when HIV irreversibly integrates its viral genome into human DNA. Viral reservoirs are extremely
durable, not susceptible to therapeutic effects of currently available antiretroviral agents, and have been
refractory to recent experimental treatment approaches. HIV infection is also characterized by a high level of
intrahost genotypic diversity of viral quasispecies. In addition to genetic diversity associated base substitution
mutations, pools of viral DNA genomes recovered from chronically-infected patients under prolonged
suppressive therapy often contain high frequencies of genome-truncated and/or hypermutated, non-replication-
competent viral DNA genomes. Only a small fraction of proviral genomes in these patients are genome-intact
and may lead to productive viral replication and virologic rebound in the absence of treatment. Furthermore,
HIV-infected cells infected with both genome-intact and genome-defective proviruses have been shown to
clonally expand, serving as a mechanism of HIV persistence. However, our current understanding of HIV
reservoirs has been derived almost exclusively from studies on a strain called subtype B HIV-1, the predominate
viral subtype affecting first-world nations but only makes up 10% of the global epidemic. In contrast, non-B HIV-
1 subtypes predominate regions such as sub-Saharan Africa where disease burden is the highest globally.
Questions remain on whether the remaining 90% of infections by other HIV-1 subtypes differ in reservoir sizes
and compositions. To address this question, we will leverage an existing biobank of a previously NIH-funded
Ugandan HIV cohort (UARTO), which houses 12360 blood cell samples collected longitudinally over ten years
from 500 predominantly subtype A1 and D HIV-1-infected individuals. We will use three cutting-edge
technologies (1) FLIP-seq to obtain near-full-length HIV-1 DNA genomes profiles, (2) MIP-seq to co-capture HIV-
1 integration sites and viral genome, and (3) and the Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) to longitudinally measure
the decay/expansion rate of the reservoir. All three technologies allow us to focus on the rare intact viral DNA
genomes that is the target for HIV cure strategies. Across subtypes, we will compare reservoir characteristics
including absolute genome-intact reservoir sizes, extent of clonal expansion, integration site profiles, viral
promoter genotypes, and longitudinal decay/expansion dynamics. We will further investigate demographic,
clinical and host factors associated with genome-intact viruses. Overall, we aim identify differences, or the lack
of differences, between HIV-1 subtype reservoirs to inform HIV cure research effort on whether a cure strategy
should be subtype-specific."

10877158,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Plasmodium falciparum is the most common and deadly cause of malaria. An effective malaria vaccine has the
potential to make a pivotal change in malaria control and eradication. For a vaccine to contribute significantly to
malaria eradication, it must target the early, pre-erythrocytic part of the lifecycle to block both symptomatic
disease and asymptomatic infection, which perpetuates transmission. Naturally acquired immunity to pre-
erythrocytic infection is acquired with exposure but remains poorly understood and continues to impede vaccine
efforts. DeAnna Friedman-Klabanoff, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine, developed this career development award proposal to use novel high-throughput tools to
define naturally acquired humoral immunity to diverse pre-erythrocytic epitopes associated with protection, which
could lead to novel vaccine candidates. Dr. Friedman-Klabanoff’s long-term goal is to become an independent
clinical and translational researcher dedicated to the development of a malaria vaccine, applying immunology
and data science to inform and optimize vaccine development. To gain the skills necessary to achieve this goal,
Dr. Friedman-Klabanoff proposes a career development plan that includes mentoring from Drs. Miriam Laufer,
Shannon Takala Harrison, Michael Cummings, Andrea Berry, Kathleen Neuzil, and John Adams, leaders in the
fields of international research design and leadership, molecular epidemiology, data science for analysis of large
data sets, use of peptide microarrays to study malaria, vaccinology, and in vitro models of pre-erythrocytic
immunity. This project will utilize samples and data from a cohort study of malaria in Malawi led by Dr. Laufer,
the primary mentor for this proposal. Household members were followed monthly for detection of malaria
infection and mosquitoes were collected from the houses to identify bloodmeal sources. Bloodmeal sources will
be identified by matching the human DNA found in the mosquito bloodmeals to DNA from enrolled participants .
Mosquito salivary glands will also be tested for P. falciparum infection to determine if the mosquitoes were
infectious. Children will be defined as protected or infected based on whether they develop blood-stage infection
during the month after an infectious bite. Aim 1 of this proposal will be to identify serologic responses associated
with natural protection against P. falciparum infection after exposure to an infectious bite. Serum from the day of
exposure will be probed on a custom-developed peptide microarray designed from diverse, field-derived
sequences to characterize pre-exposure immunity to pre-erythrocytic antigens. Aim 2 of this proposal is to
assess the functional role of antibodies targeting P. falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigens of interest. B- and T-
cell epitope prediction tools will be used to find predicted epitopes in pre-erythrocytic proteins and their variants,
and in vitro liver models will be used to assess the functional role of antibodies to these epitopes to validate and
down select the potential epitopes. The practical implications of this work will be to identify promising epitopes
that are targets of protective immunity."

Declines in spatial cognition and function of brain circuits responsible for these behaviors are among
the hallmark signs of normative biological aging across species. The objective of this research program
is to understand the basis of these age-related memory impairments. Rodent and nonhuman primate models
can each provide a unique window into understanding how age impacts networks critical for cognition, at
cellular resolution. These data can then be used to inform experiments conducted in humans to validate our
predictions. The experiments proposed in the present application are guided by three primary aims. Aim 1 is
to understand how brain circuits responsible for spatial cognition are altered in the aged rat. Two
approaches are taken in this Aim to answer these questions. A novel spatial task is employed (the
Instantaneous Cue Rotation task) that enables precise measurement of spatial behavior accuracy and
representation updating in the rat. Additionally, simultaneous, dual-structure recordings from hippocampus
and upstream entorhinal cortex will be conducted to identify age-related changes within the hippocampus
proper that are driven by entorhinal cortical inputs, as well as changes in the entorhinal cortex driven by
degraded hippocampal feedback signals. Aim 2 is to understand how hippocampal representations are
altered in aged freely behaving nonhuman primates. Recent advances in wireless recording technologies
enable new experimental designs for primates that can test directly the widely held assumption that circuit
instability (“remapping”) in the aging rat will find an analogue in the aging primate brain. Free locomotion is a
missing link between the behavioral conditions employed to study place cells in rodents, and head restrained,
chaired conditions under which most studies are conducted in primates. Our hypotheses are that old monkeys
will show faulty retrieval of hippocampal network patterns (similar to map retrieval failures in old rats) and that
the global network activity state will be altered in both age groups when the animals are restrained, compared
to when completely unrestrained and free to move. Aim 3 is to understand the neural underpinnings of
navigation deficits in aged humans. High-resolution imaging will be employed to explore age-related
alterations in both hippocampal subfield-selective ensemble codes as well as entorhinal cortex grid-like activity
that may underlie navigation impairments. Highly immersive spatial environments that include locomotion will
also be used to investigate the impact of age (young versus older adults) on the ability to maintain stable
spatial representations during free exploration. Changes in representation stability in older adults would be
consistent with inappropriate map retrieval observed in old rats. Taking advantage of new behavior and
recording approaches in rodents and monkeys and novel high-resolution fMRI and virtual reality
methods in humans, we believe significant advances will be made in our understanding of how circuits critical
for spatial cognition are altered across age and species."
10874760,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a particularly important period in social and cognitive development, characterized 
in part by rapid increases in exploration, social interaction, and neural connectivity. Social 
isolation in adolescence has a clear, profound impact on a wide range of behavioral and 
physiological endpoints extending into adulthood. The overarching research goal of this 
proposal is to elucidate how adolescent social isolation in male and female mice alters value-based 
decision making in adulthood, as well as the underlying corticostriatal circuitry driving these 
complex goal-directed behaviors. This work is timely and vitally important as COVID-19 has 
subjected an increasing number of adolescents to social isolation through school closures and 
stay-at-home orders.

A first aim of this proposal is to use operant tasks to systematically investigate how adolescent 
social isolation impacts how mice later value reward benefits and integrate expected costs during 
decision making. Preliminary data suggests that adolescent social isolation amplifies reward value, 
but specific aspects of decision-making behavior will be disentangled with computational modeling 
of value-based choice. The second aim builds on this behavioral work to test the hypothesis that 
adolescent social isolation disrupts corticostriatal circuitry and striatal output during adult 
value-based decision-making. A distributed neural network is engaged during decision- 
making, and the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is a key node in this network. Prefrontal inputs to the 
DMS from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are critically involved 
in action selection and outcome valuation, respectively. All three of these nodes 
undergo maturation and refinement during adolescence, and adolescent social isolation 
disrupts this development. However, how this impacts adult corticostriatal function remains 
unknown. Using in vivo electrophysiology, local field potential (LFP) and single- unit recordings 
will be used to test how adolescent social isolation affects synaptic strength and connectivity 
from these cortical regions to the DMS during value-based decision-making behavior.

This work proposed in the Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide Dr. Elizabeth 
Holly with training in computational modeling of decision-making behavior and in vivo 
electrophysiology, which will be an important part of the foundation of her independent research 
career. By completion of this Award, the goal is for Dr. Holly to transition to a tenure-track 
faculty position and apply for an R01. The mentorship team Dr. Holly has assembled will ensure her 
successful training in these techniques, and prepare her to transition to her own independent 
research laboratory."
10878761,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nimble and responsive transcriptional control is central to all processes of life, and hence this process is
regulated at a number of levels. During the last grant period, we discovered a robust, and unexpected, RNA-
binding activity inherent in representative proteins from two major classes of transcriptional factors (TFs): the
pluripotency factor Sox2 of the high mobility group box (HMGB) family and the glucocorticoid nuclear hormone
receptor (GR). Their RNA-binding activity was found to be mediated by their DNA-binding domains and directly
compete with DNA binding to their respective promoter or enhancer sequences. Furthermore, we found that
this activity was structure-specific rather than sequence specific in vitro. Both TFs strongly disfavored binding
ssRNA. Instead, the pluripotency factor Sox2 bound dsRNA regions while GR bound exclusively to RNA
hairpin structures.
These observations raise critical questions regarding the role of TF RNA-binding activity in transcriptional
regulation and provide the direct motivation for the research program described here. Our corroborating
discovery of RNA association of Sox2 in mouse embryonic stem cells confirms that direct RNA binding occurs
in vivo. The next steps are to further define and understand the specificity for the in vivo RNA targets and
determine the impact TF RNA interactions has on the transcriptional program. This includes refining our
understanding of what drives this RNA binding and determine how pervasive the activity is in other TFs.
We have developed an integrated and strategic research program to achieve these goals. Aim 1 capitalizes on
our observation that Sox2 directly interacts with RNAs in cells and develops this critical line of inquiry in GR to
develop a comprehensive RNA interactome including eRNAs. We will investigate whether transcription factors
use their RNA-binding activity to provide an alternate chromatin association strategy that impacts localization
and gene regulation. Finally, we take advantage of our biochemical insights to design and validate DNA- and
RNA-binding separation-of-function mutants, which will allow us to directly measure the impact of loss of RNA
binding on the transcriptome. In Aim 2, we turn to understanding the molecular nature of RNA association to
Sox2 and GR, first through the use of eCLIP strategies to identify consensus binding motifs and second
through high resolution structure determination of TF/RNA complexes. In Aim 3 of this program, we will
establish the generality of these observations to other important transcription factors, both within and beyond
the HMGB and nuclear hormone receptor families, as represented by Sox2 and GR, respectively.
Together, this proposal describes a comprehensive program seeking to determine the extent and role of RNA
binding in modulating the transcriptional program through interaction with classic transcription factors. The
impact of this program is high because understanding the roles of genome-wide pervasive transcription and
how this activity influences diverse cellular processes remains a major unanswered question in biology."
10851778,"Project Summary
Adaptation of cellular metabolism is crucial for maintaining tissue and whole-body homeostasis. In
response to low energy or stress, cells activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to phosphorylate
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which increases mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ATP
levels. However, how FAO is downregulated in energy abundance states is not fully understood. As
pathways that drive fuel addiction may provide new therapeutic targets or biomarkers for personalized
therapy, there is a critical need to identify pathways that regulate metabolic homeostasis. We have
discovered a new nutrient-dependent signaling pathway that controls fat oxidation via a little studied
member of the prolyl hydroxylase domain protein family, PHD3. PHDs are a family of -ketoglutarate
dependent dioxygenases that hydroxylate substrate proline residues and have been linked to fuel
switching. We find that PHD3 regulates fatty acid metabolism by hydroxylating acetyl-CoA carboxylase
(ACC2), a regulator of mitochondrial FAO. In response to nutrient abundance, PHD3 activates ACC2
to inhibit catabolism of fatty acids. Since ACC2 and PHD3 are highly expressed in oxidative tissues
such as skeletal muscle, this proposal will test the hypothesis that the loss of PHD3 in skeletal muscle
deregulates energy homeostasis by preventing ACC2 hydroxylation, hence causing constitutive
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. This proposal will test these ideas by: 1) defining the kinetics and
determining the specificity by which PHD3-mediated hydroxylation regulates ACC2, 2) defining the role
of PHD3 in nutrient signaling in skeletal muscle cell energetics, and 3) testing the physiological
relevance of PHD3 in muscle energy homeostasis in vivo. First, we will utilize recombinant purified
PHD3 to quantify the kinetic parameters of PHD3 hydroxylation of ACC2 versus HIF1. Next we will
examine the specificity of ACC2 hydroxylation by PHD1-3 (Aim 1). We will also examine the effect of
PHD3 on cellular metabolism in skeletal muscle cells in response to nutrient cues. We will examine the
necessity of AMPK, ACC2, and HIF1 signaling on the metabolic roles of PHD3 (Aim 2). Finally, we will
examine the consequences of PHD3 activity on skeletal muscle physiology in a resting state and during
acute energy challenge (Aim 3). Our overarching goal is to elucidate the molecular elements of PHD3
signaling that control cellular metabolism and to leverage these findings to ultimately develop
therapeutic strategies to promote improved muscle function and metabolic fitness."

10899537,"Abstract
 Recent estimates indicate that, conservatively, up to 5% of children in the United States have sufficient
behavioral and cognitive effects due to prenatal alcohol exposure that they qualify for a fetal alcohol spectrum
disorder (FASD). Children with an FASD experience a range of effects, including deficits in sensory, motor,
and executive functions, which are in turn related to poor long-term outcomes. However, few evidence-based
interventions are available for children with an FASD and, of these, only two target academic or cognitive skills.
Music training (MT) targets a complex array of skills including auditory and visual perception, multisensory
integration, attention, and working memory. These MT targets align well with the deficits experienced by
children with FASD and, therefore, MT may be well-suited for improving outcomes for these children. In this
project, we hypothesize that MT improves brain function and targeted skills via improvement in predictive
coding. The predictive coding framework posits that a primary role of the brain is to predict the environment
and optimize outcomes through identifying and correcting prediction errors. MT provides direct practice of
predictive coding when participants regularly produce sounds (environment) and adjust their behavior to
correct any errors (fix incorrect notes/timing). We further posit that this bottom-up training will help optimize
sensory, motor, and cognitive function relative to top-down strategies, leading to better outcomes.
 Our pilot MT intervention in children with an FASD provided exciting evidence for acceptance of MT by
children and parents and for the occurrence of pre-/post-MT changes at the neural and behavioral level in
children with MT vs. those without MT. In the R61 phase, we will conduct a randomized cross-over study of a
12-week MT intervention relative to a music listening (ML) control period in a larger sample to examine
neurophysiological changes in predictive coding and behavioral effects due to MT in FASD in children 8-16
years of age. We will assess changes in 1) brain function using magnetoencephalography and
electroencephalography, 2) brain structure using structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor
imaging, and 3) cognition and behavior using neuropsychological assessment and questionnaires at three time
points (pre-trial (week 1), cross-over (week 13), and post-trial (week 28)). In the R33 phase, we will again
implement a randomized cross-over design in 8-16 year-olds with an FASD to: a) compare MT effects relative
to a cognitive training (CT) control and b) evaluate dose effects by comparing 12- vs. 24-weeks of intervention.
We hypothesize that the bottom-up approach of MT, which improves sensory (auditory) and motor functioning,
will lead to changes in brain connectivity, which in turn will improve cognitive functioning relative to the top-
down approach of CT. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team to implement a music training
intervention and assess the outcomes using objective neuroimaging, cognitive, and behavioral measures.
Future studies will explore how MT can contribute to a strengths-based intervention approach for FASD."

Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder that causes cognitive deficits and impairments in basic sensory
processing. Structural and functional imaging studies in schizophrenia patients suggest that a main structural
signature of schizophrenia is reduced long-range connectivity and disconnection between brain areas, however
how such reduced connectivity affects specific circuit components and cortical function remains largely unknown.
In this project, we will combine in vivo linear probe recordings with optogenetic modulation in the visual system
of the mouse model of 22q11 deletion syndrome to study altered bottom-up and top-down modulation of sensory
processing. In addition, recent transcriptomics studies have found that neurogliaform cells, a distinct class of
GABAergic inhibitory neurons, are the most affected class of neurons in schizophrenia. Neurogliaform cells
primarily reside in superficial layer 1 of the cortex and receive inputs from corticocortical axons, including
prefrontal cortical regions, from the thalamus and higher-order thalamic nuclei, and from subcortical
neuromodulatory populations, however the in vivo function of neurogliaform cells in health and their dysfunction
disease remains largely unknown due to lack of tools to specifically target them. To clarify the role of
neurogliaform cells in bottom-up and top-down processing, we will manipulate activity in neurogliaform cells
optogenetically in wild type and 22q11.2 mice and measure their effect on sensory processing. The research
proposed in this application is conceptually innovative and significant because it will give us a better
understanding of how bottom-up and top-down cortical processing and neural circuits involved in schizophrenia.
This work is also technically innovative because of the novel approaches to specifically target neurogliaform cells
and investigating their role in sensory processing in health and in the context of 22q11.2. Ultimately, such
knowledge has the potential to offer new opportunities for identification of biomarkers of disease and for
therapeutic interventions that target specific circuits."

in resource-limited environments like low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), rural clinics, combat
environments, and many others. This is because current hemostatic assays require electrical power,
capital expense, skilled technicians, large equipment, and can be slow. As cardiovascular disease
increases in LMICs, there is an urgent need to provide innovative tools for these lower resource
environments. As an alternative, microfluidic-paper based analytical devices (PAD)s have been
developed for low resource settings as a point-of-care technology since these are rapid, cost-effective,
portable, disposable, eas-to-use, and typically require electricity. Such devices include the rapid antigen
tests developed for COVID-19, which provide critical rapid feedback for making educated health
decisions. These can be used almost anywhere with relatively little skill. Our goal is to develop a similar
point-of-care tool that we call the Paper-based Clotting Analysis Test (P-CAT). Current PADs are
limited for hemostatic analysis since they typically produce low flow conditions that can’t test many of
the processes/pathways in primary hemostasis. We have developed a fast-flow PAD that will be
incorporated into the P-CAT, enabling us to investigate the spectrum of pathways involved in
hemostasis with only a drop (microliters) of blood. P-CATs can be created rapidly and at very little cost,
thereby producing high throughput data. Here, we will develop the P-CAT to test blood samples with
high specificity and and sensitivity to 1) pathways in primary (platelet-dependent) hemostasis, and 2)
intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation cascades in secondary hemostasis. If successful, we will expand
upon the P-CAT to incorporate additional biomarkers in an automated point-of-care device that could
have a major impact on enabling portable, rapid, and inexpensive tests for hemostasis that can be
widely distributed."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia characterized by neuronal loss and synaptic
dysfunction, and histopathologically hallmarked by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
The correlation between histopathology and dementia has been challenged in the past decade by the emergence
of a group of individuals who remain cognitively intact despite the presence of plaques and tangles consistent
with clinically symptomatic AD. The existence of these individuals, here referred to as Non-Demented with AD
Neuropathology (NDAN) suggests that there is a natural way for the human brain to escape dementia.
Understanding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of resilience (the main objective of the present
project) may help the development of innovative treatment concepts based on inducing cognitive resilience in
anyone challenged by AD neuropathology.
We present compelling preliminary results that support our hypothesis that efficient TREM2-driven microglial
phagocytosis underlies structural integrity and functionality of synapses in NDAN, thus protecting from
ensuing cognitive deficits. We will test our central hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims: testing
whether high expression levels of microglial TREM2 are associated with phagocytosis of damaged
synapses around amyloid plaques in NDAN subjects, and evaluating the presence of variants of
TREM2 gene in NDAN subjects as a function of synaptic resilience.
This present project is highly significant because the proposed studies will establish TREM2 phagocytic microglia
as a key player in the maintenance of synaptic integrity. The successful completion of the aims will provide
insight into molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying synaptic resilience in relation to microglia activity in
NDAN individuals revealing new targets for future development of innovative treatment concepts based on
inducing cognitive resilience in individuals challenged by AD neuropathology. The proposed project will improve
our scientific understanding of how damaged synapses removal is mediated by TREM2 phagocytic microglia
contributing to synaptic integrity in NDAN."
10824333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescence is a common period of time for suicidal ideation to emerge and thereby presents a critical
opportunity for intervention. A key to reducing suicidal ideation during adolescence is to thoroughly understand
how potential intervention targets may operate. The present investigation focuses on positive future thinking, a
psychological process that has long been assumed to protect against risk of clinical outcomes such as suicide
and thus increasingly become an intervention target. Recent work suggests that certain manifestations of
positive future thinking may be counterintuitively harmful and may in fact confer greater risk of internal distress
and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Despite its potential clinical implications, there is surprisingly little work on
this topic—mostly limited to measures of future thinking that may not generalize to real-world settings and
limited to adult samples. Never has there been a formal study of potentially harmful effects of positive future
thinking among suicidal adolescents. Aligned with our long-term goal to disrupt the trajectory toward suicide by
intervening on malleable psychological mechanisms underlying suicide risk, the immediate goal of this R21
proposal is to study whether and how discrete aspects of positive future thinking may perpetuate suicidal
ideation among adolescents. With a sample of 110 adolescents with past year history of suicidal ideation, the
present research team will measure positive future thinking and corresponding motivational processes through
baseline assessments and via ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Specific Aims are to: (1) Test
whether adolescents’ experience of imagining ‘intrapersonal well-being’ (IWB)-themed desired future outcomes
predicts subsequent suicidal ideation; (2) Test whether adolescents’ experience of imagining unattained
desired future outcomes predicts subsequent suicidal ideation; and (3) Identify motivational processes that
may account for the maladaptive effects of imagining IWB-themed and unattained desired future outcomes.
This proposal is innovative because: (a) it features the most topographically rich examination of positive future
thinking ever conducted among suicidal individuals; (b) it features the most ecologically valid assessment of
positive future thinking ever conducted among suicidal individuals; and (c) it is conceptually radical. Exploring
this highly novel yet plausible research question may not only inform the development of more focused
interventions but also refine numerous extant interventions. Thoroughly vetting presumed intervention targets
during a time when suicidal individuals begin engaging in psychotherapy may help prevent adverse effects of
treatment and more definitively reduce suicide risk both in and out of standard treatment settings."
10876287,"While most people with psychosis are not dangerous and most violence is committed by non-psychotic people,
people with psychotic disorders are at increased risk for violence, and violence is associated with worse
outcomes and increased stigma. Therefore, decreasing violence risk in psychosis is clinically relevant and has
important public health implications. Several clinical studies suggest that clozapine is superior to other
antipsychotic medications in reducing violence or aggression. However, there were numerous limitations of
these studies including that most of them were observational and non-randomized, included small sample sizes,
or focused on hostility, non-physical aggression, or self-harm, rather than violent acts. Further, the majority of
these trials were not generalizable to outpatient, community settings. No large effectiveness study has
examined the effects of clozapine on violent behavior in community settings. We propose a randomized,
parallel-group, 24-week, open-label, single (rater)-blind, 7-site clinical trial to examine the effects of treatment
with clozapine vs. treatment as usual (TAU) on the risk of violent acts in 280 individuals with schizophrenia at
high risk for violence. This trial will be a collaboration of 7 sites, coordinated by the New York State Psychiatric
Institute. The 6 additional collaborating sites contribute unique expertise and will ensure an adequate sample
size for this trial. Our primary effectiveness outcome is time to violent acts as measured by the MacArthur
Community Violence Interview (MCVI). We will also explore the effects of clozapine on the Point Subtraction
Aggression Paradigm. While many factors may contribute to violent behavior in individuals with schizophrenia,
including positive symptoms, psychopathy, impulsivity, and substance use, evidence suggests that the final
common pathway for many of these disparate causal influences likely runs through behaviors captured by the
Excitement Factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (i.e., a composite of the scores of excitement,
uncooperativeness, poor impulse control, and hostility). Importantly, our target (the excitement factor of the
PANSS) has been validated to measure excitement-like symptoms in clinical trials in schizophrenia, is sensitive
to treatment, has been linked to the neurobiology of violence in spectroscopy and PET studies, and
differentiates clozapine from other antipsychotic drugs. We will also explore the effects of clozapine vs. TAU on
positive symptoms (e.g., persecutory delusions) and alcohol and substance use, and how these effects
influence the risk for violent acts. To enhance the safe implementation of this study in this vulnerable population
at risk of violent behaviors, we will implement clinical safety and treatment engagement protocols that rely upon
standard personnel and that will be readily generalizable. This trial will provide guidance on the use of clozapine
for violence in community settings and will definitively test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of its anti-violence
effects. The results will be immediately relevant to practice and will impact public health because there is
currently no standard approach for the treatment of violence in schizophrenia."

Located within the human Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) chromosome 6p21, the Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA) region is the most medically important region of the human genome. Variation in the HLA region
has been associated with over 150 diseases and conditions, including infectious disease, cancers, and major
drug-hypersensitivities. While little is known at this point about the impact of host genetic factors in COVID-19,
the epidemiology to-date reveals wide variation in disease course among confirmed cases of infection that does
not appear to be fully explained by known risk factors. Because of its pivotal role in the immune response
understanding the role of HLA variation promises to provide important insights relevant to understanding the
immunopathogenesis of COVID-19, while informing vaccine development and potential immunotherapies. In
Specific Aim 1, we will exploit an existing data resource, partnering with the National Marrow Donor Program
and DKMS registries to collect data on COVID-19 symptoms, testing and outcomes using a novel, validated
smartphone app in a very large sample (N=300,000-500,000) of volunteer bone marrow donors with pre-existing
HLA genotyping data, allowing an extraordinarily well-powered examination of the role of these genes in disease.
In Specific Aim 2, we will employ a novel, validated method for next-generation sequencing of the extended MHC
(~5Mb), including all classical and non-classical HLA loci, as well as over 150 additional immune system loci, in
large and diverse cohorts of COVID-19 patients (N=2000), as well patient cohorts with longitudinal clinical data
and extensive immunoprofiling (N=300). Finally, in Specific Aim 3 we will contextualize these association studies
through examination of the role of HLA presentation of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. In summary, we will leverage
large and diverse patient cohorts alongside cutting edge technology and molecular biology to reveal the role of
these important immune loci in COVID-19."

10873264,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Differences in drug metabolism between patients can significantly affect drug concentrations in the body and
overall drug response (efficacy and toxicity). Advances in pharmacogenomics have improved our understanding
of how variations in genes that encode drug metabolizing enzymes (e.g., cytochrome P450 enzymes) affect drug
response, primarily in European ancestry populations. However, far less is known about the mechanisms and
clinical consequences of genetic and non-genetic factors (sex, age, ethnicity, epigenetics, drug interactions, etc.)
that affect drug disposition in patients from understudied ethnic backgrounds. Inadequate representation of
diverse ancestral populations in both basic and translational pharmacogenomics and multi-omics studies is a
key barrier to the implementation of precision medicine for all patients. Recent findings from my laboratory
support the contention that genetic and phenotypic markers are needed to accurately assess individual drug
metabolism capacity. The overall vision of my research program is to understand the underlying mechanisms
of interindividual variability in drug metabolism and drug response to advance precision medicine in ethnically
diverse patient populations. Through this Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award (MIRA R35) for Early Stage
Investigators, my research program will address key questions and important challenges in the field through the
following distinct and complementary projects. Project 1 will test the hypothesis that the inclusion of diverse
genetic ancestry populations in pharmacogenetics studies will provide greater insight into the underlying
mechanisms of interindividual variability in drug metabolism and response. Project 2 will test the hypothesis
that the application of an integrated pharmaco-omics approach will greatly enhance the ability to precisely
quantify drug metabolism capacity in individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Project 3 will test the
hypothesis that the incorporation of data from mechanistic drug metabolism studies from understudied ethnic
populations will improve the prediction of pharmacokinetic variability using data-informed physiologically based
pharmacokinetic models compared to model predictions using European-based “reference” populations.
Significance: This research promises to shift the current “one-size-fits-all” drug dosing paradigm by utilizing and
integrating population-specific genetic variants and phenotypic biomarkers to accurately quantify individual drug
metabolism capacity, a major predictor of drug response, in understudied ethnic populations. My research
program will increase the return on investment for precision medicine initiatives by overcoming the barriers that
have limited the applicability of European-based genotype-guided dosing. This work will lay the foundation
needed to implement the right drug at the right dose for the right patient at the right time. This research represents
the first comprehensive pharmaco-omics investigation in understudied ethnic populations to utilize germline
genetic markers as well as dynamic epigenomic, proteomic, and metabolomic biomarkers to capture drug
metabolism phenotype. I am dedicated to mentoring the next generation of drug metabolism scientists."

10868569,"Reoviridae viruses, which include important human and animal pathogens, assort and package nine to twelve positive-sense RNA segments that are converted to genomic double-stranded RNA during virus assembly in cytoplasmic inclusions. Reoviridae genetic diversity contributes to host range and vaccine responses. To infect and adapt, Reoviridae viruses have evolved mechanisms to promote genetic diversity and complement defective particles. These mechanisms include segment reassortment and transmission of multiple particles as collective infectious units. Evolutionary benefits of diversity are countered by a need to maintain interactions mediating multipartite genome packaging, assembly, egress, and transmission. Thus, the replication strategy also may inherently constrain diversity. The goal of the proposed research is to understand how Reoviridae assembly and transmission processes regulate unique aspects of viral genetic diversity. To accomplish this goal, we will use reovirus, a genetically tractable Reoviridae virus with established tissue culture and mouse models. The termini of Reoviridae RNA segments are important for packaging, but RNA elements that mediate assortment of a specific collection of segments are poorly defined. In Specific Aim 1, we will sequence defective viral gene segments using long-read and short-read approaches to identify minimal reovirus RNA packaging and assortment determinants. We will determine the capacity of RNA recognition elements to interchangeably mediate segment packaging and assortment using reverse genetics and functional assays. Physical sequestration of viral RNA in cytoplasmic inclusions may influence segment reassortment during coinfection, and innate cellular responses may influence reassortment by inhibiting superinfection. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the localization of viral RNA during coinfection using sensitive RNA imaging probes and effects of infection timing on replication and reassortment in vitro and in vivo using viruses encoding silent genetic polymorphisms. Transmission of Reoviridae viruses in extracellular vesicles may promote simultaneous multi-particle infection of target cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate contributions of vesicle- mediated virus transmission to genetic diversity and virulence. The proposed studies will provide insight into mechanisms of viral genetic diversity that are mediated by the assembly and transmission processes of viruses in the Reoviridae family. Many principles derived from this work will apply broadly to viruses that replicate in compartmentalized subcellular regions, induce innate antiviral responses, or travel in extracellular vesicles. Together, these findings will promote rational engineering of Reoviridae-based preventives and therapeutics and identification of factors that predict outcomes of natural virus coinfection and transmission."
10874734,"Abstract: A critical component of the umbrella cell barrier is the apical junctional complex (AJC), a
multipartite, belt-like structure comprised of the tight junction, the adherens junction, desmosomes, and an
associated cytoskeleton. Functions of the AJC include regulation of paracellular flux, cell-cell adhesion, and
mechanotransduction. Despite evidence that the umbrella cell AJC is integral to urothelial function and
disrupted in several lower urinary tract disorders, we have limited understanding of key aspects of umbrella cell
AJC biology and pathobiology including: (i) how the AJC maintains its continuity in the face of cyclical bladder
filling and voiding; (ii) how the AJC is organized to undergo these transitions and the function of the
cytoskeleton in these events; and (iii) how the umbrella cell AJC senses tension and whether pathologically
high intravesical pressures stimulate AJC-associated mechanotransduction pathways. Our preliminary studies
include the novel findings that during bladder filling the AJC perimeter expands dramatically, a process that
depends on changes in the actin cytoskeleton and vesicular traffic, likely directed toward the AJC. In contrast,
the AJC contracts soon after bladder voiding, events driven by the non-muscle myosin II-triggered contraction
of the actin cytoskeleton, RhoA, as well as endocytosis. Based on available data, we hypothesize that critical
functions of the umbrella cell AJC are to maintain urothelial barrier function by undergoing dynamic expansion
and contraction and to serve as a site of mechanotransduction under normal and pathological conditions. To
test this global hypothesis, we propose the following experiments. In Aim 1, we will use a newly developed
biaxial stretching device, coupled with live-cell image analysis, to determine if increased strain triggers
exocytosis of junction-associated proteins directed toward the AJC, and if release of strain stimulates their
endocytosis. We will also assess if blocking AJC expansion perturbs urothelial barrier function. In Aim 2, we
will focus on deciphering the function and organization of the umbrella cell AJC-associated cytoskeleton. We
will use super-resolution confocal imaging, as well as electron microscopy to reconstruct the umbrella cell AJC
in 3D. In addition, we will determine if formins drive actin polymerization in response to filling. In Aim 3, we will
use tension sensors to determine if transmembrane proteins associated with the umbrella cell AJC sense
force, and assess whether junction-associated signaling pathways are activated in response to partial bladder
outlet obstruction (PBOO). Upon completion of these studies we will have new insights into how umbrella cell
AJC dynamics contribute to urothelial barrier function, the organization of the AJC and the function of its
associated cytoskeleton, and important new information about how the AJC senses and responds to
perturbations in its mechanical milieu, including in response to PBOO."
10824283,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Asia-Pacific region has struggled to keep up with global efforts to end AIDS as a public health threat by
2030. Only 60% of the 5.8 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) in the region are on antiretroviral therapy. In
addition, with high burdens of chronic hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis, and the emergence of COVID-19,
there is increasing local competition for limited health resources. In order to achieve long-lasting health gains
for Asia-Pacific PLHIV and move us closer to ending AIDS in the region, data-driven public health
approaches are needed that efficiently integrate clinical care and research across diseases, and target
communities at greatest risk of the poorest outcomes. Working with a network of over 50 clinical centers
in 13 countries, the IeDEA ASIA-PACIFIC RESEARCH COLLABORATION will implement a cross-cutting
research portfolio of innovative studies on the quality and durability of HIV treatment and prevention efforts, as
well as on co-infections and co-morbidities. The primary aims are: 1) to understand what it will take to end
AIDS in the Asia-Pacific; 2) to characterize what is stopping PLHIV in the region from thriving with HIV over a
lifetime; and 3) to improve implementation approaches to prevention and treatment interventions for HIV and
related conditions. The secondary aims are: 1) to more efficiently collect and curate data to optimize
research and maximize data utilization; and 2) to secure the next generation of Asia-Pacific HIV researchers
through training and mentorship. The proposed research will inform clinical practice and public health policy
through a combination of national, regional, and multiregional longitudinal cohort studies, registry and database
linkages, and priority sub-studies. Specifically, hypothesis-driven analyses of cohort data sources and data
registries will characterize HIV disease and a range of co-infections and co-morbidities in children,
adolescents, and adults, and study their impact on long-term HIV treatment durability and mortality. Analyses
will especially consider risks and outcomes of non-communicable diseases associated with HIV and aging.
Approaches to optimizing lung and anal cancer screening will be assessed. Studies focusing on young men
who have sex with men and transgender communities will characterize behaviors and co-infections that
increase HIV acquisition risk. To better understand the intersections between HIV and the use of alcohol,
tobacco, and other substances, cohort data collection will be expanded to capture a broader range of health
measurements and exposures to support analyses of physical and mental health outcomes. Investigators will
study implementation strategies for increasing uptake of, and adherence to, TB preventive therapy, mental
health care, and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. In addition, cohort research methods will be adapted to
optimize the balance between cohort size and data completeness, and improve data harmonization to facilitate
cross-cohort research. Training and mentorship for early-stage investigators will help them to develop
scientific questions and data analysis skills, and engage with regional and global HIV research networks."
10860960,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The high incidence and prevalence of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction (LUTD), a common
factor in many bladder disorders in African populations (about 66%, 20% and 6% of the male population
show mild, moderate and severe symptoms respectively), has been related to environmental and
lifestyle factors such as diet. We have previously reported in both normal and diseased bladders, that
diet alters bladder morphology, specifically cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, causing changes in
function and influencing key calcium-signalling mechanisms responsible for detrusor contractility.
Understanding of the mechanisms responsible for LUTD and other bladder disorders is still very limited;
epigenetics may play a role. Thus, the long-term goal is to determine the epigenetic effects of diet on
bladder physiology and pathophysiology, while also attaining the level of training and expertise required
for me to become an independent researcher. The overall objectives in this application are to (i)
characterize the influence of diet on specific histone modifications and gene expression changes in the
bladder and (ii) relate any observed alterations in histones and gene expression to phenotypic and
functional changes in the bladder. The central hypothesis is that epigenetic modifications contribute to
the molecular changes underlying alterations in bladder morphology and function with different diets.
The rationale for this project is that identification of the epigenetic effects of diet in the bladder will
provide a foundation, and supportive preliminary data, for subsequent studies on the roles played by
diet in the normal bladder and in bladder dysfunction. Diet, being a modifiable factor with great public
health impact, could provide an insight into the mechanisms by which LUTD occur. This project also
offers me the opportunity to establish my independence as an epigeneticist. The central hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Identify changes in bladder morphology and function after
consumption of different diets (high fat, high carbohydrate, and high protein diets); 2) Identify bladder
transcriptome changes after dietary treatment using RNAseq; and 3) Identify effects of the diets on
histone acyl marks for proliferative status (H3S10P, H3S28P), transcriptional activation (H3K9Ac,
H3K27Ac) and DNA replication (H4K5Ac, H4K12Ac) in the bladder of rats from each dietary group after
feeding. Under the first aim, excised whole rat bladder tissue will be used to identify changes in bladder
weight, detrusor contractility, and bladder histology (haematoxylin and Eosin stain, and
immunohistochemistry) to determine morphological and functional changes as a result of each diet. For
the second aim, RNA sequencing will be done to identify global changes in transcriptome abundance
in each dietary group. To achieve the third aim, protein separation techniques (SDS-PAGE) and
western immunoblotting will be employed to identify changes in specific histone targets. The proposed
research is innovative, because it focuses on a new direction for research into bladder physiology and
pathophysiology, investigating diet, a common modifiable public health factor in all patients and a
common denominator in the aetiologies of several non-communicable diseases, and how its effects on
epigenetic modifications, influencing transcription and expression of genes could result in LUTD. The
proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance scientific knowledge on the
mechanisms of bladder function, and provide an initial standpoint and data upon which subsequent
studies on the epigenetic roles played by diet in bladder dysfunction will build. It will also provide data
to support new intervention strategies for the management of LUTD and other non-communicable
dieases."

Maternal immune activation (MIA) refers to the triggering of the maternal immune system during pregnancy by
infections or chronic conditions. This leads to a series of immunologic alterations in the fetus, which can have
an impact on brain development. Large-scale, population-based studies have implicated MIA in a number of
neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Moreover,
studies in rodents have consistently demonstrated that MIA during early phases of pregnancy leads to structural
and functional brain abnormalities and behavioral dysfunction in the offspring. In humans, recent imaging studies
reported similar effects of MIA on child brain structure and behavior. However, these studies were limited by
modest sample sizes and relatively short follow-up periods.
The overall aim of this study is to investigate the impact of maternal immune activation during pregnancy on
adolescent neurodevelopment. We will use the only cohort in the world, Generation R, with both sufficient sample
size and longitudinal follow-up to combine (i) detailed information on infection and inflammation during
pregnancy, with (ii) offspring brain imaging and (iii) behavioral and psychiatric outcomes. In aim 1a we will define
our exposure variable Maternal Immune Activation (MIA). We will use detailed trimester-specific information on
infections and determine the type of infection, as well as severity. We will measure a panel of well-known pro-
inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) to calculate an inflammatory index of chronic low-grade
inflammation in serum at 13 and 20 weeks of gestation. In aim 1b we will investigate the association between
MIA, fetal growth and gestational age at birth. In aim 2, we will investigate the impact of MIA on offspring brain
structure and connectivity at age 14 years. To test the hypothesis that MIA leads to atypical cortical development,
we will include MRI measures available and ready to use for 3,757 adolescents. These include total brain, white
matter, cortical gray and subcortical volumes. In aim 3 we will determine whether MIA increases the risk for
cognitive deficits, behavioral impairments and psychopathology also at age 14 years.
This project will provide a comprehensive definition of maternal immune activation, including specific aspects of
infection such as type and timing, examine its effects on neurodevelopment, and elucidate putative mechanisms
for these effects in the largest birth cohort to date. Collectively, these outputs will suggest targets for prevention
and aid the efforts towards early identification of high-risk pregnancies."
10875533,"Summary: Distribution of dietary vitamin A/all-trans retinol/ROL throughout the body is critical to maintain
retinoid function in peripheral tissues and to ensure optimal vision. In humans, dietary vitamin A is absorbed in
the small intestine, stored in the liver, and secreted into circulation bound to serum retinol binding protein 4
(RBP4-ROL). A receptor-mediated system for systemic RBP4-ROL uptake, storage and transport is essential
not only to ensure availability for optimal ocular retinoid signaling for photoreceptor function, but also to prevent
cellular toxicity associated with excessive retinoid accumulation. STRA6, the only known receptor for circulatory
ROL bound RBP4 in the eye, is not expressed in systemic tissues proposed to facilitate the uptake of RBP4-
ROL. This indicates the existence of additional vitamin A transporters in such tissues. The objectives of this
proposal are 1] to determine the physiological role a novel vitamin A transporter, the retinol binding protein 4
receptor 2 (RBPR2) in facilitating the systemic uptake of dietary ROL bound RBP4 for vision, and 2] to investigate
if modulation of such eye related ROL transporters could limit substrate availability required for toxic retinoid
biogenesis and thus improve vision in patients with inherited retinal degenerative diseases. The long-term goal
is to identify the physiological mechanisms of RBPR2 for RBP4 binding and ROL transport in retinal health and
disease states. The central hypothesis is that RBPR2 has high affinity binding for RBP4-ROL in tissues devoid
of STRA6 and that its physiological function is critical to ensure and regulate dietary vitamin A uptake and delivery
to the eye in the support of vision. The rationale underlying this proposal is that completion will fill the knowledge
gap of how dietary vitamin A is sequestered into systemic tissues from RBP4, transported and stored in
peripheral tissues lacking STRA6, for eventual distribution to the eye for vision. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims that will in Specific Aim 1: Determine the functionality of RBPR2 for
vitamin A transport; Specific Aim 2: Determine the physiological role of RBPR2 for systemic RBP4-ROL
transport in vision; and Specific Aim 3: Determine if modulation of Rbpr2 activity attenuates inherited retinal
degenerative diseases. We will pursue these aims using an innovative combination of structural analysis,
biochemistry, cell biology, physiology and novel animal models aimed at exploring the in vivo requirements of
RBPR2 for ROL transport for photoreceptor health, vision and in retinal disease. The proposed research is
significant because it will determine for the first time the mechanisms influencing circulatory RBP4-ROL uptake,
storage and transport into the eye, and explore strategies aimed at modulation of such eye related ROL-
transporters for improving vision in humans with inherited retinal diseases. The proximate outcome of the
proposed research will provide information on a novel ROL transporter, RBPR2, that will improve understanding
of human disease states, particularly blindness, associated with impaired blood vitamin A homeostasis or ocular
vitamin A excess and could yield concepts for their prevention and therapy."

This proposal addresses the psychosocial impacts of a new kind of genetic information currently available to
the general public: polygenic scores for educational attainment (EA-PGS). Available for purchase via a growing
number of third-party, direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing companies, an EA-PGS provides information
about an individual’s genetic propensity for completing years of schooling. To the extent that it is a genetic
predictor of a complex outcome with major social and environmental causes, EA-PGS research represents a
“geneticization” of education that engenders a host of difficult ELSI questions to be addressed by this K01
proposal. Who seeks out EA-PGS and why? How do DTC customers interpret and use their results? How does
exposure to EA-PGS research impact public attitudes toward education and schooling, including attitudes
about racial/ethnic disparities in education? To address these questions, this proposal includes a plan of
empirical research, including (Aim 1) qualitative research involving in-depth interviews with individuals who
have recently received EA-PGS results via DTC genetic testing company, Geneplaza, and (Aim 2) quantitative
research involving surveys of key stakeholder groups (students, parents of students, and educators)
randomized to read stories from the popular media emphasizing either EA-PGS or social influences on
education. Finally, this proposal includes (Aim 3) a plan of conceptual research, involving development of an
ethical framework on the potential harms and benefits of the geneticization of education, developed through
consultation with an expert advisory council of prominent scholars in education policy, ethics, and genetics.
Building on the PI’s strong background in behavior genetics and philosophy of science, these aims will be
achieved with an interdisciplinary, mixed-methods career development plan that includes training and
coursework in quantitative methods, qualitative methods, and bioethics. The career development plan is
supported by a team of highly experienced and esteemed Columbia University and Hastings Center scholars
with expertise in qualitative methods, quantitative methods, and bioethics: Paul Appelbaum, Sandra Soo-Jin
Lee, Ruth Ottman, and Josephine Johnston."

This Lung Transplant Clinical Trials Network (LT-CTN) CTOT-CA consortium includes eight of the leading high-
volume, research-oriented adult and pediatric lung transplant programs in North America. Long-term survival
after lung transplantation is limited by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), the final manifestation of chronic
lung transplant rejection. CLAD is not effectively prevented by lung transplant immunosuppression, as over 50%
of transplant patients develop CLAD within five years. Growing evidence suggests upregulation of inflammatory
cytokines in the lung allograft contributes to CLAD development through innate immunity and allorecognition-
driven adaptive immune responses. Our preliminary data demonstrate that post-transplant acute rejection (AR),
lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), organizing pneumonia (OP), or acute lung injury (ALI) increase CLAD risk and are
associated with elevations of Types I & II cytokines in the lung fluid. Because Type I/II cytokines share signaling
through the Janus Kinase (JAK) family, blocking the relevant JAKs could be an effective strategy to limit
inflammatory cytokine responses and prevent CLAD. Our data demonstrate that itacitinib, a selective JAK1 and
partial JAK2 inhibitor being tested in patients with bone marrow transplant, is effective in preventing AR in a fully
mismatched murine orthotopic lung transplant model, and that JAK1 is highly overexpressed in human lung
transplant CLAD. Thus, we hypothesize that addition of itacitinib to standard post-transplant immunosuppression
will reduce inflammation due to cytokine signaling, diminish further innate and adaptive immune responses, and
prevent CLAD. To test this, we propose to complete the INhIBIT-CLAD (ItacitiNIB randomized, multi-center,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to reduce lung Inflammation and prevenT CLAD) study, enrolling 450
bilateral lung transplant recipients over two years and randomizing 280 of those at higher CLAD risk (evidence
of AR, LB, OP, or ALI) to treatment with itacitinib or placebo and follow-up over three to five years, to detect the
primary outcome of CLAD. We also will collect biospecimens from all enrolled participants and conduct
mechanistic studies using lung fluid and tissue from randomized patients to determine how innate immunity and
adaptive immune responses that contribute to CLAD development are mitigated by selective JAK inhibition with
itacitinib. Finally, as Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is another key CLAD risk factor – and preventable – we propose a
multi-center infectious disease study targeting prevention of CMV infection after lung transplant using novel
measures of CMV-specific immunity to personalize antiviral prophylaxis duration. Our highly qualified team of
investigators bring longstanding, collaborative, highly relevant experience, including leading the adult CTOT-20
and-22 and the pediatric CTOTC-03, -05, -08, and -11 studies. Successfully completed, the studies now
proposed have potential to transform clinical practice, improve lung transplant outcomes, and expand treatment
paradigms for immune suppression and anti-viral prophylaxis after solid organ transplantation."
10885999,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Converging evidence indicates that neuronal and network hyperexcitability is an important early event in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. The cellular and molecular basis of this hyperexcitability is a critical area of
investigation and the presence of similar hyperexcitability in animal models enables studies to dissect
underlying mechanisms. A key insight is that hyperexcitability in both AD patients and mouse models has a
strong diurnal rhythm. Emerging data also indicate that neural excitability in the forebrain is normally under
control of the circadian clock, which regulates seizure thresholds and susceptibility to epileptiform activity.
Circadian variation in cellular function is driven by transcriptional molecular clocks expressed in most cells, and
molecular clock ablation increases AD pathology. We have compelling preliminary evidence for rhythmic
variation in neuronal excitability that is at least partly due to circadian regulation of the membrane properties of
inhibitory interneurons, especially fast-spiking cells expressing parvalbumin (PV). Given that PV+ interneurons
in the cortex and dentate gyrus are strongly implicated in AD, and that circadian rhythms are disrupted in AD
patients and AD mouse models, we propose rigorous experiments to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of
the molecular clock and resulting changes in PV+ interneuron gene expression and activity contribute to AD-
related neuronal hyperexcitability. Specifically, we will evaluate the differences in circadian clock and clock-
controlled gene expression in PV+ interneurons vs. excitatory neurons in the mouse models of AD, using a
combination of RNA sequencing, state-of-the-art bioinformatics, and recently developed tools to evaluate
molecular clock rhythmicity and transcription in a cell-specific manner (Aim 1). We will record from inhibitory
and excitatory neurons in the dentate gyrus and cortex to determine if clock-driven changes in PV+ inhibitory
neuron activity are disrupted in AD models and contribute to overall hyperexcitability (Aim 2). Finally, we will
utilize an innovative chemogenetic chronotherapeutic approach to manipulate PV+ interneuron physiology to
determine whether reinstating the normal circadian patterns of PV+ interneuron activity in AD mice protects
against hyperexcitability, cognitive impairment, and pathology (Aim 3). The proposed studies led by a strong
interdisciplinary team use powerful approaches to determine how disruption of circadian rhythms facilitates
neuronal hyperexcitability that contributes to early stages of AD. Understanding these mechanisms may
catalyze development of behavioral or pharmacologic interventions."

Over 1 million older (≥65 years) adults with serious illness have major surgery or severe trauma each year.
After surgery or trauma, older seriously ill patients are at risk for increased healthcare use, functional and
cognitive decline, and mortality. National quality guidelines highlight that palliative care focused on aligning
treatments with health goals, improving quality of life, alleviating physical and psychological suffering, and
addressing social needs, should be provided alongside surgical care at all stages of serious illness. Palliative
care for hospitalized seriously ill patients is associated with reduced symptoms and less healthcare utilization
after discharge. Although seriously ill surgical patients benefit from palliative care, they are less likely than
other hospitalized patients to receive it; this is in part due to research gaps that have inhibited implementation
of practical palliative care interventions for older seriously ill surgical patients. Gaps include a dearth of data on
patient-oriented surgical outcomes such as pain, depression, and caregiving that can be targeted by palliative
care, methodological barriers to measuring palliative care delivery in surgical practice, and little understanding
of contextual factors that influence implementation of palliative care in surgery. The proposed study will
address these gaps by providing an innovative and layered examination of the role of palliative care in surgery.
The study has three specific aims. Aim 1 identifies a cohort of seriously ill older surgical patients (≥66y) using
Health and Retirement Study data linked to Medicare claims, and determines the association between direct
targets of palliative care (pain, depression, and caregiving needs) and less proximal benefits (reduced
healthcare utilization) to demonstrate the important role of palliative care in surgery. Aim 2 identifies a
retrospective cohort of older seriously ill surgical patients (≥66y) in a large regional health system and uses
Natural Language Processing in electronic health data linked to Medicare Claims to identify palliative care
processes (goals of care discussions, healthcare proxy documentation, pain and caregiver assessments)
delivered during the surgical episode. The association between palliative care and healthcare utilization in the
year after surgical discharge will be tested. Aim 3 uses qualitative interviews and direct observations to obtain
an in-depth understanding of contextual factors influencing implementation of palliative care processes in the
care of seriously ill older surgical patients (≥65 years). This proposal uses complementary data sources to
assess patient-centered outcomes in older seriously ill surgical patients, uses novel methods to evaluate the
impact of palliative care processes on outcomes, and deeply examines barriers to implementation of
perioperative palliative care in clinical practice. These results will directly inform bedside clinical decisions and
the implementation of targeted palliative care interventions to improve care for seriously ill older surgical
patients."

Black and Latino younger adults (age 18-64) with mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) face inequities in
TBI-related consequences, demonstrated by higher incidence and hospitalization rates, and worse cognitive,
physical, behavioral, and emotional impairments <12 months post-discharge compared to Whites. These
impairments affect patients’ abilities to independently manage their health, wellness, and activities of daily living,
resulting in dependence on family, particularly for racial/ethnic minorities. The complexity of needs combined
with the fragmentation of healthcare services creates the perfect storm for low patient quality of life (QOL),
mismanaged symptoms, rehospitalizations, and increased caregiver strain. Lack of insurance or access to care,
as well as language barriers, aggravate these ongoing issues. Despite complex health needs, there are no U.S.
standards for transitional care for patients with TBI. Transitional care is defined as actions in the clinical
encounter designed to ensure the coordination and continuity of healthcare for patients transferring between
different locations or levels of care (e.g., acute hospital care to home). In other patient groups with acute events
(e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction), transitional care interventions have led to improved patient QOL and health
outcomes. Yet, few TBI transitional care interventions exist, and these existing interventions do not equitably
address needs of racial/ethnic minorities. The prevailing racial/ethnic disparities in TBI outcomes and the paucity
of theory-driven, evidence-based TBI transitional care interventions led our team to develop a culturally-tailored
intervention named BETTER (Brain Injury, Education, Training, and Therapy to Enhance Recovery). Based on
the Individual and Family Self-Management Theory (IFSMT), BETTER is a patient- and family-centered,
behavioral intervention for younger adults with TBI discharged home from acute hospital care and families. The
goal is to improve patients’ QOL (change in SF-36 total score, primary outcome) by 16-weeks post-discharge,
as this timeframe includes high rates of unmet patient/family needs and preventable clinical events. Skilled
clinical interventionists follow a manualized intervention protocol to address patient/family needs; establish goals;
coordinate post-hospital care, services, and resources; and provide patient/family education and training on self-
and family-management and coping skills <16 weeks post-discharge. Findings from our NIH R03 pilot study
showed BETTER significantly improved patients’ physical QOL by 31.36 points (p = 0.006) and that the
intervention was feasible and acceptable with younger adults with TBI and families. Thus, the purpose of this
study is to examine the efficacy of BETTER (vs. usual care) among younger adults with TBI of various
races/ethnicities who are discharged home from acute hospital care and families. Findings will guide our team
in designing a future, multi-site trial to disseminate and implement BETTER into clinical practice to ultimately
enhance the standard of care for younger adults with TBI and families. The new knowledge generated will drive
advancements in health equity among younger adults with TBI of various races/ethnicities and families."

Emerging evidence suggests that certain neurodevelopmental disorders – autism (ASD), attention-deficit
hyperactive disorder (ADHD), and intellectual disability (ID) – may increase risk of later life neurodegenerative

amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We propose a multinational study of epidemiological and genetic data

aggregation (Aim 2) of these disorders. We also explore genetic links (Aim 3) between neurodevelopmental
and later life neurodegenerative disorders, and identify potential targets for intervention that may mitigate risk

10771274,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Necrotizing Fasciitis (NF) or “flesh-eating disease” is a rapidly progressing bacterial infection with severe
necrosis of the dermis and underlying soft tissues. Treatment of NF requires systemic antibiotics and aggressive
surgical debridement. Even with these treatments, NF has considerable morbidity and mortality. Thus, a better
understanding of the pathophysiology of NF and identification of new treatment strategies to attenuate disease
progression is required. Recent work has revealed that pro-inflammatory signals can increase or decrease
cellular resistance to the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs), key microbial toxins that permeabilize cells
and destroy tissues. The induction of a CDC “resistant or sensitive state” for phagocytes was found to be
dependent on the rapid reprogramming of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Moreover, disrupting the ability of
macrophages to reprogram their lipid metabolic state disrupts the induction of protective states by inflammatory
signals. Thus, an inflammatory-lipid metabolic circuit in host cells serves as a determinant of the pathogenic
potential of CDCs, a major virulence factor in necrotizing skin infections. In this application, we combine
advanced methodologies (e.g., mass spectrometry, single-cell sequencing, and imaging) with genetic and
pharmacologic models of lipid metabolism to understand if tissue lipid metabolism is a host factor that determines
the pathogenic potential of CDCs and group A strep (GAS) infections. Specific Aim 1 will determine the
molecular mechanism underlying how the CH25H-LXR metabolic axis mediates the protection of cells from CDC
toxicity. Specifically, we will pursue our discovery that activation of the LXR signaling pathway profoundly
protects phagocytes from CDC-mediated loss of membrane integrity. Combining lipidomics, transcriptomics,
imaging, and functional assays with gain- and loss-of function models, we will molecularly dissect the lipid
metabolic pathways necessary for LXR-mediated protection from CDC-mediated cytotoxicity. Specific aim 2 will
focus on advancing our understanding of the cell types in the skin necessary and sufficient for LXR-induced
protection from CDC tissue damage. We will apply advanced analytical techniques combined with mouse models
of altered lipid metabolism to determine the cell types and lipid metabolic pathways involved in inducing a
resistant state to CDCs in the skin. Specific Aim 3 determines which host lipid metabolism pathways are critical
for resistance to localized or NF-like experimental GAS skin infection models. Our data shows that dysregulation
of cholesterol metabolism potentiates CDC-mediated tissue damage but activating the LXR pathway induces a
protective state. In this aim, we extend these exciting observations and mechanistically test if modulating lipid
homeostasis in host tissues alters the pathogenesis of experimental NF models and may serve as an adjunct
treatment. We expect that these studies will define at the molecular level how lipid metabolism in infected tissues
influences tissue damage caused the CDC pore-forming toxins and could provide proof-of-concept evidence that
targeting lipid homeostasis is a productive approach to attenuating the pathogenesis of necrotizing infections."

The personnel in Core C have years of experience in breeding, housing and conducting experimentation with
NOD mice, which develop spontaneous T1D under specific pathogen-free conditions. A very specific
requirement for NOD mice is impeccable hygiene of the colony since minimal variations may affect T1D incidence
in both female and male mice. A strict program of sibling inbreeding, storage of embryos from highly inbred stock,
and periodic recovery of embryos from this stock is also necessary to prevent genetic drift of the type that led to
the establishment of the NOD/NckH and NOD/NckL sublines. Core C will generate 350 pedigrees of NOD/NckH
G3 mice modified by N-ethyl-N nitrosourea (ENU)-induced mutations. Pedigrees generated during the program
will exhibit an average of approximately 60 germline coding/splicing mutations and include >80 G3 female mice.
Each ENU-treated G0 male will be bred to NOD/NckH females to obtain 10-20 G1 male founders. These will be
retro-orbitally bled to recover high quality DNA for Illumina sequencing, and tail cuttings will be used to isolate
DNA from all G2 and G3 females for genotyping by Ion Torrent sequencing; Core B will perform sequencing.
All female G3 pups will be monitored every other day for the development of T1D over a period of 40
weeks. Experimental observations will consist of first detection of glucosuria confirmed by hyperglycemia. For
all mice ear tag numbers, birth dates, and phenotypic data will be uploaded to the Mutagenetix database, so that
Kaplan-Meier analysis can be performed weekly to take account of new developments in every pedigree. We
will perform similar phenotypic analyses of pedigrees carrying CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mutations generated in
Project 2, for the purposes of verification. Preliminary data confirm that modification of the NOD/NckH T1D
phenotype can be achieved, and causative mutations instantly mapped, fully supporting the discovery program
we propose. We will perform extended monitoring (through 40 weeks of age) to detect all phenotypes including
those of lesser magnitude, but we will gain time by identifying the strongest causative mutations early on. When
each G1 male has completed G2 breeding, epididymal sperm will be harvested for cryopreservation and public
distribution via the MMRRC; the mutations and their phenotypic effects will be made public on the Mutagenetix
website. At times, verification of causation depends on placing a knockout allele in trans with the original ENU-
induced allele. Therefore, as indicated, we will transfer cryopreserved sperm from Core C to Project 2, where
germline re-targeting will take place in the NOD/NckH strain. The close interaction between Core C and Core B
will include shipment of DNA at monthly intervals from Core C to Core B and uploading of phenotypic data on a
weekly basis. This will guarantee the identification of many novel modifier mutations to fuel the activities of
Project 1 and Project 2."
10866460,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of Project 1 is to understand in detail the pathological consequences of ENU-induced mutations
implicated by Core B and Core C to modify the T1D phenotype of NOD/NckH mice, and to determine the cellular
mechanisms by which those mutations impact the development of T1D. As we have done for Dusp10, a
spontaneous mutation bred to homozygosity in our lab based on phenotypic selection, we will analyze each
selected mutation to determine which salient immunopathological steps—recognized as hallmarks of T1D
initiation and/or progression—are affected. To that end, we will use tools such as analysis of pancreatic islet
infiltration (i.e. insulitis); measurement of the numbers and the in vivo functional capacity in various lymphoid
organs of diabetogenic or regulatory CD4+FoxP3+ T lymphocytes; and analysis of islet antigen presentation
using adoptive transfer of diabetogenic cells expressing the transgenic BDC2.5 T cell receptor (specific for an
autoantigenic fusion peptide incorporating insulin and chromogranin A sequences) into 4-week-old recipients.
We will pay particular attention to mechanisms of insulin resistance, and to the definition of markers of increased
β-cell sensitivity witnessed with particular genetic mutations. In doing so it is plausible that novel
immunopathological steps will be discovered. Second, we will investigate the contribution of particular tissues or
cell types bearing each mutation to the development of T1D using bone marrow transplantation, adoptive transfer
in neonates, islet transplantation, tissue-specific conditional knockout mice, and islet organoid cultures in the
presence or absence of immune cells. Results will provide important guidance to Project 2, focused on molecular
pathogenesis. We will perform cellular mechanistic studies to understand of the effects of mutations in Paqr8
(protective), and Dusp10, Rapgef1, and Xpnpep1 (exacerbating), identified in our initial collaboration. We expect
to actively pursue mechanistic studies of four to six proteins at a time, adding one new protein per year by mutual
agreement with Project 2. We expect that strong synergy between Projects will accelerate our progress. An
important question we will address is the relevance of our findings to human health. To understand how
mutations identified in NOD mice relate to human T1D, we will study the effects of selected mutations in NOD
mice bearing a T1D-susceptible humanized immune system modified to contain or lack the orthologous
mutations in human hematopoietic stem cells and/or human islet cells. We will also identify human T1D patients
with mutations in genes orthologous to those we implicated in our screen of NOD mice. Our findings will uncover
new therapeutic targets for treatment of T1D and help to improve prediction of T1D onset in humans."
10866465,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Project 2 will verify and then study the molecular mechanisms of phenotypes created and genetically solved in
Core B and Core C. We expect to find scores of mutations with modifier effects over the term of funding, but
we will not study all of them mechanistically. Herein we describe the key criteria used in selecting mutations to
study and propose to begin with four mutations identified as T1D modifiers in our preliminary work (affecting
Dusp10, Paqr8, Xpnpep1, and Rapgef1). We will proceed by re-targeting candidate genes in NOD/NckH and/or
NOD/NckL backgrounds using CRISPR/Cas9 to create germline knockout alleles or replacement alleles (exact
re-creations of the ENU-induced alleles) or both, to verify or exclude causation. Once verified, the encoded
proteins will be studied in their mutant and WT forms to identify other proteins with which they associate, what
effects the mutation might have on such associations, and also effects on cell signaling. Interactions will be
directly tested in cells known to have altered function as a result of the mutation (based on studies from Project
1). Mass spectrometry pulldown will be performed using primary cells isolated from mice in which we have
engineered epitope-tagged versions of the WT and/or mutant proteins in the germline. Verification of direct and
indirect interactions will depend upon reciprocal pulldown of the target protein and putative interactors in HEK
293 cells. We will identify direct interactions using purified proteins and GST pulldown studies in vitro, as well
as size-exclusion chromatography. Structural studies will be performed as warranted to determine precisely how
each implicated protein interacts with its binding partners, and how the ENU-induced mutation alters this
interaction. The effects of mutations on post-translational modification of cellular proteins will be examined when
signaling abnormalities are suspected. These studies will, in many cases, reveal the molecular basis of
acceleration or suppression of T1D. Frequent communication of our findings with Project 1, and vice versa, will
mutually inform studies in both Projects, resulting in the understanding and development of the very best
candidates. Our conclusions may point to alterations of signaling pathways affecting immune or β-cell function
in a relatively subtle way. Yet in each case, there will be a highly significant effect on T1D development.
Particularly in the case of strong and novel suppressor mutations, we hope to identify therapeutic opportunities
for prevention or mitigation of T1D in human patients. Project 2 will undertake construction of inducible
conditional alleles to test such therapeutic opportunities, instituting gene knockout or conversion immediately
after the onset of T1D to determine whether remission may be established. This would point to the potential
treatment of human patients during the honeymoon phase of T1D. We will make data on all modifier mutations
publicly available via the Mutagenetix Candidate Explorer portal. The CRISPR/Cas9 alleles (like the ENU-
induced alleles) will be available via the MMRRC."

Dyslexia is a neurodevelopmental disorder of literacy that affects monolinguals and bilinguals alike, including
Chinese-English bilinguals, who make up >3 million of the US population (US Census Bureau, 2015). At the
onset of English-dominant schooling, bilinguals with dyslexia often experience a progressive decline in home
language use. Yet, bilingualism theories pose that a bilingual’s two languages interact in ways that enhance
children’s global language and literacy faculties (Hernandez, 2019). To advance literacy perspectives, we seek
to understand the impact of cross-linguistic interactions on literacy development in bilinguals with dyslexia.
Our objective is to uncover how Chinese-English bilingualism influences literacy development in children with
dyslexia. We adopt the Lexical Quality (Perfetti 2002; 2021) framework to conceptualize dyslexia as an
alteration in the development of sound-to-print and meaning-to-print associations. Chinese orthography
emphasizes meaning-to-print associations (McBride, 2021). Our preliminary findings suggest that neurotypical
Chinese-English bilinguals form stronger meaning-to-print associations and show stronger engagement of the
semantic neurocircuits than English monolinguals, in English (Sun, 2021; 2022). The project’s hypothesis is
that bilingual experiences with Chinese influence dyslexia by strengthening semantic literacy skills in English.
To test this hypothesis, we focus on semantic and phonological literacy skills in Chinese-English bilinguals and
English monolinguals educated in the US, and Chinese monolinguals educated in Taiwan (ages 8-10, n=365
per group, n=50 with dyslexia per group). Children will complete lexical morphology and phonology functional
Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging tasks and literacy measures in each of their language(s).
We seek to determine the effects of bilingualism on learning to read in neurotypical bilinguals (Aim 1) and
bilinguals with dyslexia (Aim 2). Direct cross-linguistic comparisons of monolinguals in the US and Taiwan will
help isolate language-specific effects of bilingualism in dyslexia (Aim 3). The approach will provide empirical
bases to (1) uncover mechanisms that influence literacy in bilinguals with dyslexia; (2) advance theories
through cross-linguistic evidence on the development of foundational reading competences in structurally-
distinct orthographies; (4) specify sources of individual variability in neuro-cognitive processes during the key
periods of brain development for learning to read; (5) focus on semantic literacy skills to inform lexical
morphology instruction for children with dyslexia. The project will advance our understanding of children’s
emerging neural architecture for learning to read in linguistically-diverse learners with and without dyslexia."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is an inherited, early-onset, and irreversible form of vision loss. RP can result from
mutations in over 100 unique genes. The burden of developing individualized treatments for each mutation is
high, so strategies that improve photoreceptor health regardless of mutation would be benefit patients.
RP perturbs retina energy metabolism, and disrupted energy metabolism can cause degeneration. Metabolic
reprogramming may prevent photoreceptor loss. Reprogramming efforts should be aimed at correcting
changes that occur with RP, yet it is unclear which changes to correct. In RP there are disruptions in
glucose transport, aerobic glycolysis and the normal expression of TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway
(PPP) genes. Due to critical gaps in these studies, the nature and timing of these changes is unclear. The lack
of comprehensive detail on how RP alters metabolic flux hampers efforts to protect photoreceptors.
The aims of this application are aimed at understanding changes to metabolism in RP. Specifically, in aim 1 I
will determine how the rate of metabolism changes with disease stage. I will infuse 13C-labeled glucose or
lactate through catheters to probe flux of carbons through metabolic pathways in the retina and RPE-choroid. I
will quantify 13C accumulation in metabolites of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the PPP, gluconeogenesis, and
glycogen. Metabolites that fuel these pathways must first be transported from circulation, through the retinal
pigment epithelium (RPE), and to the retina. In Aim 2 I will determine metabolites that increase O2
consumption by ex vivo RPE-choroid, and which of these best labels intermediates in the RPE-choroid in vivo.
This proposal also seeks support for my career development. My development goals include presenting my
work at conferences and leveraging these presentations to form a scientific network. I will also take scientific
and non-scientific courses to improve my ability to perform surgeries and mentor young scientists. These
opportunities will prepare me for a position as an independent investigator, where I can continue to fulfill the
aims of this proposal and further develop my research program."
10815872,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prion disease is a rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disease that arises from a single protein, the native prion
protein (PrP), which is capable of post-translational conversion into a self-templating and deadly conformer
termed a prion. The centrality of PrP to this process, as the essential substrate for disease, has long led to the
therapeutic hypothesis of PrP reduction in the brain. However, despite strong genetic evidence and
pharmacological proof of concept using antisense oligonucleotides, whole-brain PrP reduction has been
difficult to achieve at scale with large gene, biologic or even oligonucleotide therapeutics. We have recently
identified two small molecules with PrP-lowering properties that may point towards more therapeutically facile
ways to achieve this end, while simultaneously illuminating new facets of PrP’s biology and basal regulation.
Following their discovery through a high-throughput immunofluorence-based phenotypic screen, we have now
confirmed both potency and considerable proteomic selectivity with PrP among the top two downregulated
proteins in cells following treatment with either compound. We now seek to take the following steps to deeply
understand the relevance of these molecules to prion biology, both by identifying the mechanisms by which
they are lowering PrP and by exploring their ability to do so in vivo. 1) Targeted cell biological and genetic
follow-up of PrP-lowering compounds. We will use molecular biology tools to probe changes to PrP’s
processing, localization, synthesis rate and degradation rate following treatment. We will assess the drug
responsiveness of a minimal ectopic expression cellular system. We will also perform targeted knockdown and
overexpression of the non-PrP proteins most effected by compound treatment according to tandem mass tag
(TMT) proteomics. 2) Unbiased approaches to discover the mechanism of PrP-lowering compounds. As
a complement to proteomics, we will perform RNA sequencing on compound treated and untreated cells. To
refine the specificity of our proteomic profiles of drug activity, we will perform TMT in a range of paradigms
leveraging inactive analogs of lead compounds, inactive compounds with the same annotated mechanism of
action, PrP knockout cells, and multiple treatment timepoints. Finally, we will perform an immunofluorescence-
based, pooled genome-wide CRISPR screen to discover effectors and sensitizers of drug-mediated PrP
reduction. 3) In vivo pharmacokinetics and target engagement. Leveraging the strong pharmacokinetic
profiles of our lead compounds, we will dose mice to achieve accumulation in known PrP-expressing tissues,
including PrP-expressing peripheral tissues for robustness against the possibility of low brain uptake. We will
then assess the relationship between drug accumulation and PrP levels. Altogether, this work will both uncover
one or more biological pathways capable of regulating PrP levels and provide much-needed new directions for
translational efforts against this fatal and currently untreatable disease, potentially offering clues to aid
development of the first PrP-lowering small molecule drug."

Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are an important component of the immune cells that reside in the tumor
microenvironment (TME). The type and number of TILs in the TME have an impact on overall survival and are
an indicator of response to immunotherapy. Despite their importance as an indicator of a patient’s immune
response to cancer, there are multiple challenges for analyzing TILS from large population data sets involving
thousands of samples. There is a lack of methods that can automate an analysis of histopathologic images for
different features such as the spatial distribution of TILs, their topological interactions with their neighboring cells
in the TME and their association with specific clinical outcomes. Even more challenging is integrating TIL metrics
with cancer genomic data. Most other methods provide qualitive metrics of TILs and frequently rely on manual
inspection from pathologists – this approach lacks scalability and is subject to observer bias. To address these
challenges, we developed a computational framework that uses a deep learning model to identify multiple cell
types from histopathology images. The major innovation of our approach is molecular label transferring that
annotates tens of thousands of small areas extracted from histopathology images without manual inspections.
This approach is highly accurate, efficient, scalable and readily automated for the analysis of millions of images.
 The objective of this project is to address a key challenge in the application of deep learning to
histopathological image: large number of labeled images as training data set. We have three specific aims to 1)
identify spatial quantification of TILs from over 10,000 histopathological images from the Cancer Genome Atlas
Project; 2) correlate TIL metrics with clonal tumor mutation burden (TMB); 3) determine association of TILs with
immune checkpoint blockade responses. This research is significant because our approach enables for a
comprehensive characterization of TILs from histopathological images at cellular level, using data that is
commonly accessible in clinical settings and can be readily integrated with cancer genomic data."

When a US hospital system is overwhelmed by disaster, Crisis Standards of Care guide the triage teams forced
to choose which patients receive scarce life support treatments. Analogous to an organ allocation system, these
algorithms convert ethical principles into a concrete rank ordering of candidates for Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
treatments with life support allocation scores. Disasters that produce scarcity tend to fall hardest on
disadvantaged communities, especially racial and ethnic minority groups. When designing algorithms to allocate
scarce life support, public health officials should take this context into account.
 In an attempt to identify the critically ill patients with the highest likelihood of benefit from treatment,
most US states would prioritize those with low Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. But
SOFA was designed for patients already on life support in the ICU, using routinely measured laboratory values,
drug doses, and vital signs to monitor response to treatment. Most patients have low SOFA scores when
critical illness is first recognized, and SOFA cannot accurately predict the risk of death using data before life
support was allocated. We demonstrated how the poor predictive performance of SOFA-based triage protocols
is partially explained by underpredicting the survival of Black patients due to a miscalibrated renal component
of the SOFA score. There is a clear need to develop and validate a novel life support allocation protocol
designed to debias existing scores and save more lives. Place-based disadvantage indices, such as the
Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and the Social Vulnerability Index, offer a potential solution. Using these
validated geographical measures of neighborhood deprivation to allocate scarce healthcare resources
counteracts the risk-increasing effects of social disadvantage, including disadvantage produced by racialized
residential segregation. We hypothesize that a well-designed life support allocation score using place-based
disadvantage indices can save more lives and mitigate healthcare inequity in a crisis.
 The overall objective of this project is to develop a life support allocation algorithm that accurately and
equitably allocates scarce ICU treatments in a crisis. In Aim 1, we will use structural equation modeling to
create an Equitable Life Support Allocation (ELSA) score, using place-based disadvantage indices to debias
SOFA. In Aim 2, develop the ICU Crisis Simulation Model (ICSM), a discrete event simulation that models
patient flow and survival, as a testing and evaluation environment for life support allocation protocols. In Aim 3,
we will externally validate ELSA and ICSM in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative Data Enclave, which
currently contains geocoded records from 14 million patients from 74 sites. Our project will address one of
the most pressing challenges in applied public health ethics, producing 1) an empirically derived score to
distribute life support more accurately and equitably in a crisis and 2) open-source simulation software to
evaluate the efficiency and equity of life support allocation protocols."

We want to build on this work to help more pregnant women quit. We will pair the texting intervention with

to increase rates of smoking cessation. Despite national guidelines to implement the 5 Aʹs—Ask, Advise,

improving OB clinicians' smoking cessation counseling skills, we can potentially double the effect of the SMS

10851745,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Overall tissue function deteriorates with age, but the female reproductive system is the first to age. Female
reproductive aging is characterized by a decline in egg quantity and quality which contributes to miscarriages,
infertility, and birth defects. Cessation of reproductive function at menopause also accelerates overall aging
because the gonadal hormone, estrogen, regulates numerous tissues (e.g., brain, heart, bone, immune cells,
reproductive tract). The consequences of female reproductive aging are significant because women are delaying
childbearing, and medical interventions have increased the gap between menopause and lifespan. Thus there
is a critical need to discover the molecular mechanisms underpinning female reproductive aging. A hallmark of
aging tissues is “inflammaging” or chronic physiologic stimulation of the innate immune system leading to low
levels of sterile inflammation with age. The Duncan and Gerton laboratories recently discovered a prominent
inflammatory signature in the aging ovary, both within the somatic compartment of the follicle (granulosa cells)
and in the stroma or tissue microenvironment. However, the mechanism by which this age-related ovarian
inflammation is generated, sustained, and propagated across cell types is not known and must be addressed to
advance the field. Our long-term goal is to discover the molecular regulators of female reproductive aging from
perspectives of the gamete, follicle, and ovarian microenvironment. Thus, our application is aligned with the
NICHD’s Fertility and Infertility Branch high-priority research area of reproductive transitions. The major objective
of this grant is to discover signals exchanged between oocytes and their surrounding granulosa cells, and how
intercellular communication drives the broader spatiotemporal pattern of ovarian aging. Our overarching
hypothesis is that, with advanced reproductive age, cytosolic DNA originating from loss of genomic stability in
the oocyte stimulates the innate immune response and inflammatory pathways in ovarian granulosa cells which
are then further amplified by the tissue microenvironment. Central to our model is the cGAS-STING pathway
which links genomic instability and inflammatory responses across cells within a tissue. This pathway has never
been examined in the ovary, nor within the context of ovarian aging, but our preliminary data strongly support a
fundamental role. To address our overarching hypothesis, we will identify age-associated genomic instability
signatures in the mouse oocyte that serve as trigger signals (Aim 1). We will then determine how granulosa cells
integrate oocyte-derived signals to initiate an age-associated innate immune response (Aim 2). Finally, we will
discover how the spatio-temporal architecture of ovarian fibrosis and inflammaging govern the follicular response
and vice versa through spatial transcriptomics (Aim 3). These aims will provide a comprehensive and integrated
molecular mechanism of inflammaging at high spatial temporal resolution that considers the gamete, follicle, and
the ovary. The positive impact will be the discovery of novel molecular pathways that could be targeted in cell
type-specific manners to improve gamete quality, reproductive longevity, and healthspan."
10889207,"Project Summary/Abstract – Clinical and Biostatistics Core
The Clinical and Biostatistics Core (CBC) is a central component of the Evaluating Modes of Influenza
Transmission (EMIT-2) program. The overall objective of this core is to perform a series of randomized clinical
studies of influenza transmission to comprehensively evaluate viral, host, physical, and environmental factors
that facilitate efficient human-to-human influenza transmission. In these studies, healthy participants who have
no or very low levels of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies to the current year’s vaccine strains will spend
up to four days in contact with participants naturally infected with influenza virus and recruited by Research
Project 1 (RP1). Each study in the series will employ an environmental intervention and a personal protection
intervention designed by Research Project 2 (RP2). The core will provide the platform for collection of clinical
and environmental samples by each of the two projects and the Advanced Bioaerosol Technology Core
(ABTC). The clinical research facility for this project, Pharmaron Baltimore, has a long history of collaboration
with the University of Maryland Center for Vaccine Development and is a site for the NIAID CIVIC program.
The goals of this core will be achieved through the following specific aims: (1) Provide regulatory and safety
infrastructure for a randomized controlled trial of influenza transmission; (2) Screen for healthy adult volunteers
(Recipients), willing to temporarily reside on an inpatient containment unit approximately 2 weeks during the
influenza season, and index cases with acute influenza infection (Donors); and (3) Expose un-infected eligible
volunteers to influenza-infected index case patients. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be
assembled to provide safety oversight over the conduct of the transmission studies. Ultimate oversight of the
CBC’s activity will be the responsibility of the Core Leader (Dr. Chen) and Co-Investigator (Dr. Ortiz) and will
include close coordination with the Projects and Cores of this U19."
10889211,"Project Summary/Abstract – Advanced Bioaerosol Technology Core
The Advanced Bioaerosol Technology Core (ABTC) will develop a comprehensive suite of innovative
technologies for improved sampling, fractionation, culture, and characterization of influenza virus aerosols to
enable new analytical capabilities in support of the U19 research project goals. The advanced technologies
developed through the ABTC will be employed within each individual research project to yield more effective
studies of airborne transmission and infectivity through a combination of efficient ambient sampling to evaluate
size-dependent distributions of infective virus within the clinical environment, and high-resolution individual
exhaled breath sampling to elucidate the fundamental source terms needed for accurate transmission modeling.
The ABTC team will leverage expertise across the fields of bioengineering, bioaerosol system engineering, and
respiratory virology to develop 5 interconnected technologies for advanced bioaerosol analysis. In Aim 1, a set
of compact instruments will be developed for the collection and parallel size-based fractionation of ambient
environmental aerosols to enable distributed monitoring of airborne virus during the proposed clinical studies. In
Aim 2, a second aerosol sampling instrument employing a unique exhaled breath sampling technology will be
developed to provide high resolution aerosol fractionation and collection, allowing us to evaluate both viable and
non-infective virus emission from individual donors across narrow particle size ranges. To enhance infectivity
characterization for sampled virus particles, a synthetic mucus hydrogel will be advanced in Aim 3 as a novel
sample target for the environmental sampler, providing improved virus capture and cell culture, greatly improving
virus capture and viability for downstream infectivity assays. A digital cell culture array technology will be
developed in Aim 4, enabling the direct isolation of individual aerosol particles captured by the exhaled breath
sampler, and allowing us to evaluate distribution and clustering of both viable and non-infective virus units at
single particle resolution. The ABTC team will also develop an optimized cell line that will be employed for the
analysis of virus collected with the developed instruments to enhance evaluation of infectivity. The core will
validate the developed technologies for aerosol sampling, capture, isolation, culture, and analysis through a set
of ferret studies before integration with the proposed U19 research projects, and will execute the required assays
using clinical samples to support the goals of RP1 and RP2. The results of the ABTC research efforts will yield
the instruments and technologies needed to enhance our understanding of influenza aerobiology, from the
determination of critical source terms to the evaluation of infective particle distributions within the environment,
supporting significant improvements to influenza transmission modeling, risk analysis, and mitigation, while
making important contributions toward advancing our understanding of other respiratory viral pandemic threats."
10923854,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, affecting over 2.2 million Americans. Although elevated
intraocular pressure (IOP) is the primary risk factor for the development of the disease, the mechanisms by which elevated
IOP eventually leads to damage and loss of neural flow function for optic never head (ONH) are still unclear. It is also
unclear how sensitivity to IOP varies and interacts with other risk factors for glaucoma, such as aging and race. ONH is the
principal site of damage in glaucoma, and the blood flow in the ONH and its perfusion directly related retrobulbar circulation
have been recognized as an important role in glaucoma patients, particularly in a subgroup of primary open-angle glaucoma
and normal-tension glaucoma. Currently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and its angiographic extension (OCT-A)
are, at present, clinically accepted technologies for ophthalmic imaging. Previous OCT systems were able to demonstrate
blood-flow in two-dimensional B-scan images based on decorrelation and/or Doppler effects, this capability excited minimal
interest. It was only with the development of high-speed OCT systems that could acquire multiple 3D scans fast enough to
produce en-face images of the retinal/choroidal vasculature that OCT-A became in short order a standard ophthalmic
imaging clinical modality, even replacing fluorescein angiography to a great extent. A limitation of OCT, however, it is its
inability to image ONH and posterior segment of eye that beyond the opaque sclera tissue due to limitation of OCT
penetration. Instead, ultrasound color Doppler methods have long offered a means for visualizing and characterizing flow,
even in optically inaccessible areas such as the ONH and posterior pole of the eye. However, the spatial resolution of
conventional line-by-line scan ultrasound imaging is fundamentally hindered by the diffraction limit of the ultrasound wave,
resulting in less ability to characterize the fine vasculature network of the deep eye. Since ultrasound contrast agents such
as microbubble are much smaller than the wavelength of ultrasound, acquisition and localization of successive ultrafast
frames containing microbubbles may provide an opportunity to reconstruct and map both flow velocity and microvessel
density map with a ten-fold resolution improvement than conventional ultrasound imaging, which is defined as super-
resolution ultrasound microvessel imaging herein. In this proposal, we will develop high frequency ultrasonic 2D array with
frequencies in the range from 15 to 20 MHz which will be interfaced to a fully configurable ultrasound imaging system
(Verasonics, Kirkland, WA). The combination of novel compounding plane wave image technology and 3D ultrasound
microbubble localization/tracking algorithm will be able to provide high-resolution microvessel blood flow imaging of ONH
and retrobulbar circulation. We have three aims: 1) Fabricate high-frequency 2D array and integrate 2D array with
configurable imaging system; 2) Implement 3D plane-wave imaging and develop 3D super-resolution ultrasound
microvessel imaging algorithm using flow phantoms; 3) Conduct in vivo rabbit eye imaging to assess blood density and
flow velocity on ONH and retrobulbar vessels with different IOPs. Success of this study will pave the way towards pursuing
clinical application of Glaucoma."
10908344,"SUMMARY
In day-to-day life, we often must select actions by envisioning the likely outcomes of our behaviors, and we adjust
our behavior if prospective outcomes become more or less valuable. This capacity for prospective decision
making can be imperiled by addictive drugs, such that individuals suffering from substance use disorders may
seek addictive drugs despite threats to social ties, employment, etc.
 The ability to select actions that will result in valued rewards requires the medial orbitofrontal cortex (MO),
particularly when those rewards are not immediately delivered (are unobservable) and must be anticipated.
Addictive drugs like cocaine cause MO atrophy and impede MO function in both rodents and humans,
emphasizing the need to fully understand the manner by which the MO coordinates prospective action selection.
 The neurotrophic factor, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), and its high-affinity receptor
tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) control MO function. BDNF presence in the MO is necessary and sufficient
for mice to appropriately direct behaviors towards rewards of higher value relative to low-value options. Further,
locally overexpressing a truncated isoform of TrkB (TrkB.t1), which acts as a dominant negative, or locally
ablating TrkB occludes value-based action, particularly when potential rewards are unobservable. We
hypothesize that neurotrophin signaling stabilizes neural connections essential to adaptive choice.
 Which neural connections are necessary for choice behavior? We recently discovered that ventral
hippocampal (vHC) inputs to the MO are necessary for value memory updating – and particularly, the integration
of new value information into instrumental response strategies. Meanwhile, projections from the MO to the
basolateral amygdala (BLA) are necessary for value memory retrieval (and not updating). Thus, vHC inputs to
the MO appear to update value memory, while outputs retrieve new memories to execute adaptive action.
 The goals of this proposal are to: (1) determine whether functional vHC-to-MO and MO-to-BLA connections
require TrkB-mediated signal propagation on excitatory MO neurons.
 (2) We will next determine whether MO neurons form stable value memory traces necessary for adaptive
choice, and whether trace formation requires i.) vHC inputs, ii.) TrkB, and iii.) local dendritic spine plasticity.
 (3) The capacity for prospective goal-directed action improves throughout adolescence. Because of this,
mechanistic insights can be gained by studying adolescent development. We will delineate the adolescent
development of vHC-to-MO projections, the morphological maturation of projection-defined layer V MO neurons,
and the stimulation of TrkB+ MO neurons during decision-making tasks in mice. We will test the hypotheses that
TrkB controls typical development, and that TrkB+ MO neurons are increasingly stimulated during tests of
behavioral flexibility as mice mature, ultimately forming stable memory traces attuned to value information."

provides expertise in the science of collecting and managing patient-reported outcome data, assessing energy
balance, and developing and implementing technology applications for behavioral assessment and intervention.
AIM is a merger of the former CCSG core, Patient-Reported Outcomes, Survey and Population Research
(PROSPR), and the CCSG Developing core, e-Health Technology (EHT). Consolidation of these two resources
provided a more cost-efficient and integrated population research core facility. AIM is led by Dr. Susan Peterson
(director), a professor in the Department of Behavioral Science, and Dr. Karen Basen-Engquist (co-director), a
professor in the Department of Behavioral Science and the director of the Center for Energy Balance Research
in Cancer Prevention and Survivorship. In the past 6 years, services have been provided to 105 center members
in all 16 CCSG programs. Utilization of services provided by the AIM facility has increased 60% since grant Yr37
with 20% of the increase from the former PROSPR facility. Usage has diversified over the past 6 years with an
increased number of users from clinical and translational CCSG programs. Peer review-funded usage accounted
for 96% of AIM's total usage in Yr42; non-peer review funding accounted for 4% of its usage. In the past year,
services have been provided to 36 center members in 12 of 16 CCSG programs with a similar fraction of peer-
reviewed usage over the 6-year period. Population science programs accounted for 39% of AIM's usage, and
clinical-translational CCSG programs' combined usage accounted for 50% of AIM's total usage. Current CCSG
support accounts for 24% ($236,054) of the operating budget, chargebacks account for 45% ($441,576), and
institutional support accounts for 31% ($306,914). In Yr44, AIM is requesting $278,346 (32%) in CCSG funding.
AIM has provided support for 75 publications since the previous grant period; 14 (19%) were in journals with
IF >5. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1. To provide expertise in the science of collecting and managing patient-
reported outcome data, including that collected with surveys, web applications, and mobile applications. Aim 2.
To provide expertise in energy balance research, including the assessment of diet, physical activity, and physical
functioning, and in the delivery of physical activity interventions. Aim 3. To provide expertise in the development
and implementation of mobile, web, and sensor applications for behavioral assessment and intervention."

10893458,"Atherosclerosis is a multi-faceted vascular disease that involves maladaptation of several cell types in the arterial
wall responding to systemic and local factors. During the last two funding cycles, we have used bioinformatics
and system biology approaches together with in vitro and in vivo experimental validations to study the cellular
and molecular mechanisms by which atheroprotective and atheroprone flows regulate the vascular endothelial
cell (EC) in health and disease. Our results demonstrate the crucial roles of flow-regulated EC epigenomes and
transcriptomes in the atheroprotective and athero-prone phenotypes. Emerging evidence suggests that the focal
nature of atherosclerosis is linked to EC heterogeneity resulting from interplay between intrinsic EC properties
and extrinsic shear forces. To further advance our understanding on EC heterogeneity in relation to
atherosclerosis, we hypothesize that mediators (e.g., MED-1) coordinate with lineage-dependent transcription
factors (LDTFs, e.g., KLF4) and signal-dependent transcription factors (SDTFs, e.g., SMAD2) to regulate the
spatiotemporal networks of mechanotransduction. The five specific aims proposed to test this novel hypothesis
are: Aim 1. To delineate the spatiotemporal changes in flow-mediated EC epigenomes and transcriptomes with
single-cell resolution; Aim 2. To elucidate the effect of shear stress on interactions between ECs and vascular
smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages (MØs) with spatial resolution; Aim 3. To characterize the
transcriptomes and the regulating epigenomes in the arterial wall in vivo with spatial resolution; Aim 4. To employ
system biology approaches to compute and integrate data for the construction of temporal and spatial regulatory
networks; Aim 5. To validate the shear stress-regulated EC heterogeneity at the disease level using mouse
atherosclerosis models and human artery disease specimens. With the use of multi-omics platform at single-cell
resolutions, this renewal proposal will decipher the shear stress regulations of the EC heterogeneity and the
consequential phenotypical changes of ECs and neighboring cell types (SMCs and MØs) relevant to
atherosclerosis."

We propose to exploit unique features of the Atlantic killifish model system to elucidate the interaction of
genetic variation and environmental exposures in the etiology of congenital heart disease (CHD). This
complex human disease encompasses a suite of structural and functional deficits and is the most common
human congenital malformation worldwide. The etiology of CHD is poorly understood, but appears to
involve both genetic and environmental risk factors, including exposure to environmental chemicals. The
Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) is a novel population-based model system that harbors substantial
genetic diversity and exhibits chemical-induced cardiovascular disease states that mimic substantial
aspects of CHD in humans. Killifish inhabit urbanized environments that are polluted by mixtures of
chemicals including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Urban
and non-urban populations vary profoundly in their sensitivity to CHD caused by exposure to these
compounds. We propose to use this unique and powerful system to explore gene-environment interactions
associated with CHD, expanding on our successful use of the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) approach in this
species. A particularly compelling feature of this model is that natural selection has increased the frequency
of otherwise rare variants that influence sensitivity to these (and potentially other) important classes of
pollutants. Our previous data reveal some regions of the genome that affect fitness in polluted
environments, and contribute to variation in sensitivity to CHD.
The overall objective of the proposed research is to determine the genes and pathways harboring genetic
variation that controls sensitivity to PCB- and PAH-induced CHD. We will test for genetic associations
through genome-wide genotyping of phenotyped animals in replicate families bred using QTL strategies and
exposed to PCB and PAHs. Experiments will test for genetic association with multiple specific structural and
functional deficits that define the suite of CHD phenotypes. This QTL mapping will include 1) multiple
genetic backgrounds, 2) multiple CHD-associated chemicals, each with different hypothesized mechanisms
of action, and 3) multiple exposure levels. We will test whether the different CHD features are associated
with unique or shared variants in different genetic backgrounds, and whether disease-associated variants
are unique or shared among structurally diverse classes of chemicals that may cause CHD by different
mechanisms. We will evaluate the relevance of CHD-associated variants by testing whether they are
associated with variable fitness between polluted and clean environments, focus inference of candidate
genes using eQTL mapping, and test hypothesized associations using genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9
technology. This research in a population-based vertebrate model will reveal mechanisms underlying gene-
environment interactions involved in determining susceptibility to CHD, a common congenital condition."

Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer therapy, their use has benefited only a subset of
cancer patients. The multiple mechanisms utilized by tumors to inhibit an anti-tumor immune response have
impeded their widespread use as monotherapies, and this is particularly true for gliomas. Therefore, there exists
a critical need for new, complementary strategies for achieving powerful and durable immune responses against
gliomas. In particular, mutant isocitrate-dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1-R132H; mIDH1) is a hallmark of adult gliomas.
We have developed a fully immune competent murine mIDH1 model by incorporating genetic lesions
encountered in the human disease into the genomic DNA of neural progenitor cells using Sleeping Beauty
Transposase and shown that these intracranial tumors exhibit the hallmarks of human mIDH1 glioma. Our long-
term research goal is to develop novel strategies that can achieve immune stimulation with potent anti-mIDH1
glioma immunity. Our main objectives in this application are to engineer a powerful and safe platform vaccine
technology for inducing robust, durable anti-tumor memory T-cell responses against mIDH1 gliomas. To this
end, we have developed a new vaccine technology based on synthetic high-density lipoprotein (sHDL)
nanodiscs. We have shown that sHDL nanodiscs efficiently deliver antigens and adjuvant molecules to antigen-
presenting cells and achieve strong T-cell responses with robust cytotoxic potential. Here, we propose to
evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of sHDL nanoparticles in genetically engineered murine glioma models and
transplantable intracranial gliomas. Specifically, we propose to (1) optimize our nanotechnology for improved
mIDH1 Ag delivery and elicit durable memory T-cell responses against mIDH1 glioma (Aim 1); (2) evaluate their
efficacy to eradicate mIDH1 gliomas using neurospheres derived from the mIDH1 genetically engineered glioma
model (GEM) implanted into immunocompetent mice (Aim 2); (3) test the hypothesis that combining nanodisc
vaccination with standard of care (radiation) and anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade will elicit robust anti-
mIDH1 glioma immunity with long-term immunological memory in mIDH1 GEMs. These studies will shed new
light on nano-vaccine delivery platforms for precision immunotherapy. More broadly, the work proposed will
address current technical limitations in vaccine technologies and potentially lead to a new treatment option for
mIDH1 glioma patients."

High rates of opioid abuse and overdose deaths represent a substantial public health issue in the United
States. Avoidance of withdrawal symptoms is a primary driver of continued opioid use and overdose.
Understanding the neuroadaptations induced by chronic opioid exposure holds great promise for the
identification of novel and efficacious therapeutics. The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT), located in the
dorsal midline thalamus, encodes behavioral states relevant to drug addiction, including arousal, hunger,
reward-seeking, and aversion. Recent studies have pointed a critical role of the PVT and its projections in
regulating many behavioral effects of opioids. The Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is expressed in many brain
regions, which collectively mediate many cellular and behavioral effects of opioids. It remains unknown to what
extent the MOR in the PVT contributes to morphine withdrawal-induced somatic signs. In addition, several
important questions remain poorly understood. How is the MOR is activated in the PVT? How does chronic
morphine exposure and subsequent withdrawal affect the action potential firing—the final output—of PVT
neurons? To what extent do the changes in neuronal activity contribute to morphine withdrawal-induced
somatic signs? Two Specific Aims are proposed to address these questions. In Aim I, I will determine the
extent to which activation and desensitization of the MOR alters neuronal output of PVT neurons following
morphine withdrawal. Slice electrophysiology and in vivo Ca2+ imaging with fiber photometry will be employed
to address this question. In Aim II, I will use Cre-LoxP technique to selectively delete the MOR in the PVT and
examine its impact on withdrawal-induced somatic signs. Additionally, I will test whether blocking withdrawal-
induced increase in excitability in PVT neurons affects the aversive behavioral effects of morphine withdrawal.
Completion of this project is expected to provide excellent training opportunities to learn a wide range of
powerful techniques, including ex vivo slice electrophysiology, in vivo fiber photometry, in situ hybridization,
immunohistochemistry, viral microinjection, pharmacology, and animal behavior assays. Further, the proposed
research will deepen our understanding of cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying adverse effects of opioid
withdrawal."
10848473,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Notch receptors play a critical role in cell fate decisions and in the regulation of bone remodeling, either
directly or through the induction of their target genes, namely Hairy Enhancer of Split (Hes) and Hes-related
with YRPW motif (Hey). Hajdu Cheney Syndrome (HCS) is a devastating disease characterized by
developmental abnormalities, acroosteolysis and bone loss with fractures. HCS is associated with mutations in
exon 34 of NOTCH2 upstream of the PEST domain leading to NOTCH2 stabilization and gain-of-function. We
created a mouse model of HCS (Notch2tm1.1Ecan) that presents with osteopenia due to enhanced
osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. These events are secondary to an increase in receptor activator of
nuclear factor Kappa B ligand (RANKL) by cells of the osteoblast lineage, and to direct effects of NOTCH2 in
cells of the myeloid lineage. In this lineage, the expression of HES1 is induced by NOTCH2 and the
inactivation of Hes1 in the osteoclast lineage reverses the in vitro and in vivo phenotype of HCS mutants.
Moreover, HES1 induces osteoclastogenesis directly and as a result causes osteopenia in vivo. This reveals a
previously unrecognized function of HES1 in osteoclast differentiation and function that will be explored as part
of the proposed research. An additional goal of the proposed work is to develop ways to correct the skeletal
manifestations of HCS by targeting the mutation with Notch2 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO), a strategy that
would be applicable to other genetic disorders of the skeleton. Our specific aims are: Aim 1) To determine the
role of HES1 in osteoclastogenesis. Our goals are to induce and inactivate Hes1 specifically in cells of the
osteoclast lineage to determine its contribution to osteoclast differentiation and bone remodeling as determined
by microcomputed tomography and histomorphometry; Aim 2) To establish that the Notch2tm1.1Ecan mutation can
be targeted. We will determine whether the Notch2tm1.1Ecan mutation can be downregulated specifically and the
Notch2tm1.1Ecan skeletal phenotype ameliorated by the administration of antisense oligonucleotides targeting the
Notch26955C>T mutation; and Aim 3) To validate the mechanisms of the HCS phenotype and ASO approach in
NOTCH2 mutant-induced pluripotent (iPS) cells. To this end, we created NOTCH2HCS mutant iPS cell lines
to study the impact of the mutation on osteoclastogenesis and the efficacy of ASOs in downregulating
NOTCH2 mutant alleles. The goals of the proposed work are to understand the mechanisms and develop
specific antisense technology to treat the skeletal manifestations of a devastating NOTCH2-associated
disease."

RNA-programmable cell-type targeting, editing, and therapy
Abstract
Systematic identification and manipulation of cell types is necessary for dissecting mechanisms of biological
functions in health and disease. Although large-scale, single-cell transcriptome profiling now enables
identification of all major transcription-defined cell types in many organisms, easy and systematic experimental
access to all major cell populations is needed to physiologically and anatomically validate these statistical
“transcriptional clusters” as cell types and, more importantly, to interrogate their roles in tissue organization and
function. The difficulty of selectively manipulating cell types remains a critical barrier to such studies. Current
approaches to this problem mostly rely on germline DNA engineering, which is slow and expensive and poses
ethical issues, especially in humans and other primates. Cell-type transcriptional enhancers afford a non-
germline approach, but their identification and validation remain effort-intensive and costly. To overcome these
barriers, all of biomedical research urgently needs a novel approach to manipulate cell types in a way that is
specific, easy yet comprehensive, affordable, and generalizes across organs and species, akin to CRISPR-
based manipulation of genes. Here I propose to develop a paradigm-shifting technology that will enable RNA-
programmable cell-type targeting and manipulation based on the fundamental biology of RNA editing. To achieve
this breakthrough, I will harness a set of next-generation, multi-functional ribonucleoprotein devices, which can
detect the presence of specific RNAs in somatic cells and trigger the expression of effector genes for cell
visualization, monitoring, and manipulation. This method builds upon the universal RNA sensing and editing
system within all metazoan cells, centered around the editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA
(ADAR). I term this method CellREADR (Cell access through RNA sensing by Endogenous ADAR). As
CellREADR leverages endogenous cellular machinery and is built with a single modular RNA molecule that
functions through Watson-Crick base pairing, it is highly specific, inherently programmable, fast, affordable, easy
to use, and widely applicable. I propose to build and optimize CellREADR devices in cell-culture systems and
validate the method in a highly complex organ - the brain - by targeting and manipulating a large set of neuronal
cell types in the mouse cerebral cortex. We will extend CellREADR across species by targeting cell types in ex
vivo human brain specimens, and in the macaque and avian brain. Further, we will design intersectional
strategies for targeting increasingly specific cell types, and combinatorial strategies for simultaneous and
differential manipulation of multiple cell types in a tissue. By linking cell-type RNA sensors to a variety of effector
genes that alter cell functions, ranging from ablation to subtle physiological modulation, we aim to edit cell
composition and function for next-generation tissue engineering. This technology will result in large arrays of
CellREADR libraries for targeting all major cell types across diverse species, akin to CRISPR-based gene editing
of diverse genomes. Thus, CellREADR will have a broad impact in basic biology, medicine, and biotechnology."
10881897,"Opioid driven exacerbations of neuropathological events and alterations in HIV transcription contributing to HIV
associated CNS dysfunction are well-reported. Despite years of continuous suppressive antiretroviral therapy
(ART), latent HIV persists and finds sanctuary in many of the same brain regions involved in opioid use disorder
(OUD) suggesting interactions between HIV and opioids in brain cells. However, there is a sizeable gap in our
knowledge on how OUD impacts cellular responses and viral persistence in HIV-infected brain on ART in humans
or relevant model organsims. This proposal seeks to generate topographical data sets and evidence at single
cell resolution across the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), two brain regions known for predilection for
HIV persistence and OUD in non-human primate (NHP) and in post-mortem human brain. These data will provide
an unprecedented cellular landscape of multiple modalities that can be harnessed to develop strategies to limit
viral persistence and restore and retain optimal brain health in people living with HIV. In our published and
preliminary work we have developed innovative single-cell approaches: (A) Single-cell isoform RNA sequencing
(ScISOr-Seq), which enables single-cell long-read RNA sequencing of polyadenylated RNAs across thousands
of single cells; (B) Slide-isoform sequencing (Sl-ISO-Seq) to spatially locate isoforms in brain slices and (C) a
single-cell platform that identifies HIV sequences at single cell level (ScHIV-Seq). In concert these novel
sequencing and computational methods, along with scATAC-Seq for chromatin accessibility, will permit the
mapping of cellular gene expression, open chromatin regions, isoforms and the detection of HIV across single-
cells of hippocampus and PFC. Recent literature supports the presence of HIV in the brain and more specifically
in microglia and astrocytes present within the hippocampus and PFC. Importantly, these brain regions are also
involved in associative learning processes for OUD. Moreover, our prior studies in rodent hippocampus have
laid the groundwork for the proposed studies by establishing the regional and cell-specific distributions of opioid
peptides and receptors as well as related signaling molecules, and how these distributions are impacted by sex,
stress and opioid-associated learning. In further preliminary studies, we conduct opioid receptor mapping, brain
spatial transcriptomics, NHP cognitive behavioral assessment and pharmacological profiling of current ART
regimens in tissues. These approaches will provide a comprehensive regional landscape to support our single
cell specific phenotypes. We propose an overarching hypothesis that: (i) our new integrated single-cell
methods will map single-cell and cell-type specific human and NHP transcriptome and epigenome signatures in
the hippocampus and PFC of S/HIV in NHPs and post-mortem human brain; (ii) chronic opioid exposure adds a
distinguishable signature to S/HIV infection with long-term ART and defines cell subtypes in which these
signatures are rooted; and (iii) these signatures are different from chronic opioid exposure on uninfected brain.
These studies further an understanding of molecular mechanisms in HIV and OUD in brain."

 The adult cochlea presents many technical hurdles to researchers studying the normal function of its
constituent cell types, and how these cell types respond to injury, aging and degeneration. Because the
cochlea is encased in strong bone and contains relatively small numbers of cells compared to other sensory
organs such as the retina, isolating cells to characterize their structure, physiology or gene expression is
challenging. Moreover, histological methods to make the cochlea more accessible, such as decalcification, are
harsh treatments that can degrade mRNA or protein. In this pilot R21 proposal, we will assess the feasibility of
a recently-developed technique known as MERFISH – Multiplexed Error-Robust Fluorescence In Situ
Hybridization – to simultaneously detect and quantify the expression of hundreds of genes in the cochlea. We
believe this technique is sensitive enough to reveal quantitative differences in gene expression along the
developmental and tonotopic gradients that exist along the basal-apical axis of the cochlea. Developing a
robust protocol to detect, quantify and spatially localize hundreds of genes at once has the ability to transform
our understanding of the normal function of the cochlea, and how gene expression changes in the cochlea and
spiral ganglion after noise exposure, hair cell loss, aging and drug administration. The goal of this proposal is
to demonstrate the feasibility of MERFISH in the neonatal and adult cochlea and to develop protocols to allow
MERFISH to be used by the hearing and balance community."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) significantly increases the risk of developing progressive kidney fibrosis and chronic
kidney disease (CKD). T cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) have been shown involved in
pathogenesis of AKI; however, their role(s) during AKI-to-CKD transition remain uncertain. Our recent
publication and preliminary data revealed that failure of resolving tubular injury from unilateral
ischemia/reperfusion injury (U-IRI, a rapid AKI-to-CKD transition mouse model) led to not only macrophage
persistence but also a second wave of T cells and PMNs infiltrating into tubulointerstitium, which closely
associated with a proinflammatory milieu. Concomitantly, the tubular cells from U-IRI kidney expressed higher
level of injury marker, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam1), and exhibited a dedifferentiated expression
profile, correlating with kidney atrophy. Clinically, we found that increasing numbers of T cells and PMNs in the
renal interstitium at the time of renal biopsy in patients with AKI negatively correlated with 6-month recovery of
GFR. In the U-IRI mouse model, we found that depletion of T cells and PMNs attenuated the second wave of
tubular injury and partially restore tubule mass, suggesting that T cells and PMNs promote secondary tubular
injury and kidney atrophy, and that blocking T cells and PMNs recruitment can attenuate CKD from AKI. Our
chemokine/receptor pair analyses from the scRNA-seq dataset on the IRI kidneys identified that CXCL16 and
MCP-2 (Ccl8) are the top homing signals to recruit T cells (CXCR6+) and PMNs (CCR1+) and that persisted
macrophages are the primary source of CXCL16 and MCP-2 during AKI-to-CKD transition. Together, these
findings have led us to hypothesize that in the setting of failed tubular repair, macrophage-expression of
CXCL16 and MCP-2 promotes a second wave of T cells and PMNs infiltrating into the injured kidneys and that
tubular VCAM-1 enhances T cells adhesion and retention, which together lead to secondary tubular injury.
Thus, targeting the CXCL16/CXCR6 and MCP-2/CCR1 as well as VCAM-1/T cell signaling after kidney injury
holds great potential for the treatment of CKD progression. To test this hypothesis, we propose to define the
importance of CXCL16/CXCR6 and VCAM-1 signaling in T cell homing and adhesion (SA1) and the
importance of MCP-2/CCR1 signaling in PMN homing (SA2) during AKI-to-CKD transition and then to translate
our understanding of these homing signals into developing polyamidoamine dendrimer nanoparticles that can
selectively deliver siRNAs to knockdown these homing signals to slow or even prevent CKD progression (SA3).
This work will provide preclinical data defining how to prevent the second wave of immune activation and
transition from AKI to CKD."

This project is focused on understanding the physical and mechanistic properties of enzymes that underlie
their exquisite function. In recent years, protein motions have been implicated as essential to achieve an
extremely rapid catalysis of bond cleavage events at enzyme active sites. Methodology for the spatial and
temporal resolution of such protein motions has been developed using enzyme prototypes that catalyze
hydrogen and methyl transfer reactions. These studies are now being extended to the TIM barrel family of
enzymes that represent 10% of known enzyme structures and catalyze 5 out of 7 known EC classes. With this
knowledge in hand, new approaches arise for protein redesign, de novo design and drug targeting. A second
emerging area in biological catalysis concerns the post-translational modification of peptides that have been
synthesized at the ribosome. A combination of structural and biochemical probes is addressing the enigmatic
pathway that produces the bacterial cofactor and vitamin, pyrroloquinoline quinone. As the result of a number
of recent breakthrough observations, each of the catalysts within the pathway is now amenable for detailed

possible new target for antibiotic development."
10791853,"Accurate and multiplexed characterization of proteins is essential to basic and clinical studies in immunity,
infection, development, and cancer. Many processes in immune development, signal activation, and drug
resistance are driven by a small subset of cells and variable activation of signaling pathways, necessitating
single-cell measurements. Currently, there is high precision and throughput in measuring DNA/RNA in single
cells, however a major technological gap exists in the measurement of proteins and especially their complexes
in individual cells. High-throughput methods combining simultaneous measurement of proteins, complexes and
mRNA are needed to better understand and model individual cellular responses, and to discover new cell states
and functions. Our proposal has two, equally important, and synergistic goals: a) optimize/adapt a broadly
applicable and practical technology that simultaneously measures proteins, protein-complexes and mRNA in
thousands of individual cells (Aim 1), and b) study several key hypotheses on the function and evolution of
signaling networks during immune development (Aims 2 and 3). Our technology, called Intracellular Proximity-
Sequencing (iProx-seq), uses DNA barcoded proximity probes and single-cell sequencing for multiplexed
measurement of proteins and their complexes. The number of protein complexes measured by iProx-seq scales
quadratically: Targeting 100 proteins will enable the measurement of 5500 potential protein complexes in each
cell. Protein quantification by sequencing has the additional benefit of transcriptome-wide mRNA measurements
in the same cell, all using a robust and widely used sequencing pipeline. Extensive preliminary data we present
demonstrated the feasibility of our entire technical approach and mechanistic studies.
 We will combine iProx-seq, live cell imaging and mathematical modeling and study key hypotheses in the
differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and B cells in the germinal center (see Aims 2 and 3). We will
measure signaling receptors, adaptor proteins, transcription factors, cytokines, kinases, and protein
modifications, and comprehensively characterize immune signaling networks NF-κB, MAPK, PI3K and IRF3 in
single human and mouse HSCs, monocyte derived macrophages, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and
germinal center B cells. Specific questions we will answer include: How do changes in receptor levels, receptor-
coreceptor complexes, and intracellular complex formation explain single macrophage sensitivity to inflammatory
TLR signals? How does the developmental remodeling of protein networks NF-κB, MAPK, PI3K and IRF3
regulate signal specificity across the hematopoietic lineage? What are the distinct proteomic and signaling states
in the germinal center, and how do protein networks regulate the differentiation of B cells? Our proposal will
result in a powerful and practical single-cell analysis technology and improved insight on the function and
evolution of protein networks in immunity. Our results will make significant impact into the understanding of
immune development, immune activation, and emergence of drug resistance."

Lymphatic vessels are essential to maintaining interstitial fluid homeostasis, immune cell trafficking and antigen
clearance. Ineffectual clearance due to inadequate lymphatic transport is a key promoter of many diseases that
reflects insufficient number, reabsorptive capacity and contractility of the lymphatic vascular network. In contrast
to blood vessels, lymphatic vessels are exquisitely sensitive to interstitial elements, including Na+ which is a
powerful regulator of lymphatic growth in hypertensive settings. Our studies in hypertensive settings, have found
Na+ activates the highly reactive lipid oxidation product, isolevuglandin (IsoLG) in antigen presenting immune
cells (APCs) via the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Our new data reveal proteinuric kidney disease increases
intrarenal Na+ and thus establish a high Na+ environment within the kidney parenchyma. Like ENaC in immune
cells, Na+, not osmolality, modulates expression of the sodium potassium chloride co-transporter (NKCC1) in
lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). Proteinuric animals as well as humans have elevated levels of urinary IsoLG
adducted to apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) best known for its role in inflammation, oxidative stress, and cholesterol
handling in atherosclerotic heart disease. Although kidney disease manifests all co-morbidities linked to modified
apoAI, little is understood about these effects on kidneys. We show for the first time that kidney injury promotes
intrarenal IsoLG and that IsoLG-apoAI upregulates NKCC1 in LECs. Together, our published and preliminary
data support the hypothesis that kidney injury leads to renal Na+ accumulation which stimulates
lymphangiogenesis, activates LECs, weakens lymphatic dynamics that encourages immune cell
trafficking into the renal interstitium through mechanisms that involve Na+ sensing via NKCC1 and IsoLG
uptake by LECs. Our studies will define how intrarenal Na+ accumulation modulates the lymphatic network and
crosstalk between renal lymphatics and activated immune cells which we postulate promote interstitial stagnation
of potentially harmful molecules and cells and subsequent tubulointerstitial fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we
propose three mechanistic aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that that injury-driven accumulation of Na+ in renal
interstitium directly disrupts the structure and function of the renal lymphatic network via a IsoLG-NKCC1
pathway. Aim 2 will define how Na+ activated immune cells involve IsoLG and vasoconstricting endothelins to
impair renal lymphatics thereby increasing renal interstitial stagnation. In Aim 3 we will determine that activated
monocytes with high IsoLG from humans with CKD blunt lymphangiogenesis and weaken lymphatic pumping
that promotes progressive kidney fibrosis in humanized mice."

More than 1 million Americans are hospitalized with sepsis each year, and nearly one in

NIGMS R35 award, we derived sepsis endotypes using a suite of machine learning
methods inside the electronic health records (EHR) in a large integrated health system.
These endotypes differed in biology, outcomes, and treatment response, and were
reproduced in thousands of patients. But how will they lead to precision care? In this
Renewal, we will leverage our clinical translational laboratory and remnant blood
collection to better understand the biology of sepsis endotypes and explore new
domains related to pathogen, microbiome, and molecular mechanisms. We will use
Bayesian causal networks and reinforcement learning to optimize treatment policies over
endotypes in more than 10 million EHR encounters. Finally, we will move learning online
and embed endotypes inside the EHR at the point-of-care. These steps will take the
science of sepsis endotypes and inform clinical decisions made under time pressure and
uncertainty. By testing endotype treatment policies at the “live-edge”, we will strengthen
causal inference, mechanistic insight, and learn while doing. My program will be
supervised by external advisory boards with expertise in machine learning, inflammation,
immunology, computational and systems biology, causal methods, artificial intelligence,
and health information technology. This work will further develop my clinical-translational
laboratory and cross-cutting mentorship of junior scientists."

The Virtual Reality Unmet Clinical Needs course offered at the junior level will engage
undergraduate engineering students using online and immersive active learning
techniques to develop intuition, teamwork skills, and unmet clinical needs evaluation
prior to their senior capstone course, the BioENGINE program. This course will be
offered through online websites and virtual reality applications to allow large institutions
and those without access to medical centers to be able to perform clinical immersion
and unmet clinical needs finding for all undergraduate biomedical engineering students.
Through immersive technologies such as virtual reality, simulations, and online lectures
using manikins and staged real-life simulations, we will provide a large class size of
students the opportunity to understand how medical devices are used in the real world,
and identify novel potential commercializable solutions that they will develop during their
senior capstone course. To accomplish this, students will work in multidisciplinary teams
to develop a proposed innovative medical solution identified through the immersive
clinical environments exploration and filmed clinician interviews.
By having all students in the curriculum the ability to perform unmet clinical needs
identification and evaluation through virtual immersion, we will provide an inclusive
online active learning program to all students in our program as well as those at other
institutions. Through this strategy, all biomedical engineering students will gain more
practice, depth, and experience in listening, learning, and designing a solution to an
unmet clinical need, we hope to gain a more effective method of teaching biomedical
engineers how to solve problems in a real world situation, and how to communicate in a
team more effectively."

Retinal neovascularization (RNV) is a debilitating complication of advanced diabetic retinopathy, which despite
the use of anti-VEGF and laser treatments continues to cause blindness. Less is known as to why RNV develops
only after patients have had diabetes for decades. Although endothelial cell (EC) angiogenic activation is a
hallmark of this transition, how ECs adapt their metabolism to sustain such activation remains a significant gap
in our knowledge. Our long-term goal is to determine the bioenergetic mechanisms of RNV. The Warburg effect
is a metabolic shift from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) to hyperglycolysis that was first found
in cancer cells. This metabolic shift not only produces ATP faster than OxPhos, albeit less efficiently, but also
provides precursors required for lipid, protein, and nucleotide synthesis during cell proliferation. Recently the
Warburg effect was rediscovered as a key contributor in various endothelial-related diseases; however, its role
in diabetic retinopathy is not well-defined. In this application, the overall objective(s) are to define the role of
the Warburg effect in diabetic retinopathy and to identify its underlying mechanisms. Here, we propose that
multiple hits are needed to cooperatively alter EC metabolism to fulfill biosynthetic demands of transforming a
quiescent EC into an angiogenic cell. Tissue hypoxia is the most common risk factor associated with advanced
diabetic retinopathy. Thus, our central hypothesis is that diabetes primes quiescent ECs to be angiogenic (first
hit) and that hypoxia (second hit) is necessary for angiogenic switch via the metabolic adaptation of the Warburg
effect. Aim1 will test the hypothesis that persistent activation of the energy sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) sustains the Warburg effect to mediate EC angiogenic activation. Our approach is to use a two-hit model
of diabetes and hypoxia in AMPKα1 endothelial-specific conditional knockout (AMPKα1End-/-) mice and in AMPKα1
silenced human retinal ECs (HRECs) to achieve this aim. We will also use vitreous samples from patients with
proliferative diabetic retinopathy to test the correlation between the development of RNV and the Warburg effect-
associated metabolites. Aim2 will investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in mediating the
Warburg effect-induced EC angiogenic activation. We hypothesize that activation of Inositol-requiring enzyme
(IRE)1, a unique ER-stress sensor protein with kinase and RNase activities, is a key mediator for the Warburg
effect-induced EC angiogenic activation. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 to test the effect of inhibiting downstream
signaling of IRE1 kinase and RNase activities on the Warburg effect-induced EC angiogenic activation. We will
also test our hypothesis in vivo using a two-hit model of hypoxia and diabetes and selective pharmacological
inhibitors. Overall, this new-investigator initiated R01 capitalizes on the interdisciplinary expertise of a
biochemist, a mitochondrial biologist, an ER biologist, and a clinician to use a novel two-hit model of advanced
diabetic retinopathy to gain mechanistic insights into the bioenergetic basis of RNV. Understanding the role of
the Warburg effect will reveal novel targets in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy."

To combat obesity and its related metabolic comorbidities, it is necessary and significant in precisely modulating
adipose tissue functions (i.e. lipolysis, beiging, thermogenesis) which play a crucial role in the control of energy
balance and glucose homeostasis. The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a well-known satiety center in the
brain to prevent body weight gain. However, the exact mechanisms and precise circuitry through which the VMH
modulates adipose tissue sympathetic outflow and function remain incompletely understood. Literature and our
recent study show that selective stimulation of neurons expressing steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) in VMH rapidly
increases energy expenditure and heat generation. We also find that selective stimulation of VMH SF1 neuron
projections to paraventricular thalamus (PVT) elicits minimal effects on expenditure and head generation. Our
preliminary data show that selective stimulation of VMH SF1 neuron projections to PVT increases norepinephrine
(NE) contents and the phosphorylation of lipolytic hormone-sensitive lipase (p-HSL) in the inguinal white adipose
tissue (iWAT), and stimulation of SF1 neuron projections to rostral periaqueductal gray (rPAG) increases NE
contents and temperature in the inguinal brown adipose tissue (iBAT). Our results also show that cold exposure
excites a subset of VMH SF1 neurons, revealing cold-sensitive and cold-insensitive VMH SF1 neurons. We thus
hypothesize that there are molecularly distinct subsets of VMH SF1 neurons which respectively modulate iWAT
and iBAT functions through different sympathetic circuits. We focus to study VMH SF1 neurons, PVT, rPAG,
iWAT, and iBAT. We propose to identify and characterize SF1 subpopulations and sympathetic circuits that
modulate iWAT or iBAT (Aim 1), to determine the impact of cold on VMH SF1 neurons and synapse transmission
(Aim 2), and to determine if attenuating Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptor (CP-AMPAR) and tumor necrosis factor
a (TNFa) receptor (TNFR) signal in SF1 neurons can prevent obesity in HFD-fed mice (Aim 3). Overall, our
previous studies and preliminary results have enabled us to identify and characterize SF1 neuron-originated
sympathetic circuits that modulate iWAT or iBAT functions in physiological and pathological conditions. With
innovative combined neuroscience and genetic and metabolic methods and techniques such as central and
peripheral tissue photometry, electrophysiology, cell-type selective genetic, and several transgenic mouse lines,
this research project will test several novel concepts, including previously unknown VMH SF1 subpopulations
respectively modulating iWAT and iBAT functions and differentially responding to cold, cell-type specific gene
expressions, and the roles of CP-AMPAR and TNFa signals in the VMH SF1 neurons in DIO development and
prevention. The information to be collected from a series of logical studies will provide a molecular and circuit
framework that will then allow further studies by us and other groups to further understand the mechanisms for
CNS regulations of adipose tissue function and energy metabolism as well as glucose homeostasis."

Childhood cancer is the leading cause of death by disease past infancy in the U.S. While survival rates are
improving, stark racial/ethnic disparities remain. Hispanic children have a significantly higher incidence of
several cancers, and inferior overall survival than their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts. Although
clinical trial enrollment is linked to higher survival and NIH mandates appropriate inclusion of minorities in
clinical trials, Hispanic children with cancer are significantly underrepresented in cancer clinical trials compared
to NHWs. Given that Hispanics will comprise 33% of the U.S. childhood population by 2030, there is an urgent
need to identify effective interventions to overcome low trial accrual to equitably benefit Hispanics. Novel data
from our group suggest that inadequate research literacy (capacity to understand and act on information to
make decisions about research) is a barrier to participation in clinical trials. There are major gaps in knowledge
about interventions to improve research literacy and clinical trial participation for Hispanic children. This R01 is
informed by the PI’s peer navigation intervention developed during her K08 award, “COMPRENDO”
(ChildhOod Malignancy Peer REsearch NavigatiOn). COMPRENDO (adapted from the evidence-based patient
navigation model) involves trained peers (parents) who deliver culture, language, and health literacy-
concordant education to parents/guardians of children with cancer during informed consent for therapeutic
clinical trials. In our pilot feasibility study, COMPRENDO was feasible, highly acceptable by stakeholders and
increased parental informed consent comprehension and voluntariness (willingness to participate in research
without feeling pressured). The logical next step is to test COMPRENDO effectiveness on a larger scale. We
will study COMPRENDO in a multisite effectiveness-implementation randomized clinical trial (RCT) in 4 sites
with diverse populations of Hispanics. Our long-term goal is to implement generalizable, targeted, effective,
and reproducible peer navigation interventions to enhance minority accrual to clinical trials. The overarching
objective of this R01 is to increase clinical trial accrual in Hispanic children with cancer by improving research
literacy in their parents in a Hybrid Type 1 design to both test COMPRENDO effectiveness and explore
multisite implementation determinants. Hispanic parents will be randomized to COMPRENDO or usual care
[informed consent with the oncologist only]. We will measure child-centered (accrual) and parent-centered
(comprehension, voluntariness, decisional regret, decision-making self-efficacy, and satisfaction) outcomes.
Impact: This research is significant as it addresses an understudied area by yielding actionable knowledge on
how peer navigation can improve research literacy. Developed with stakeholder input, COMPRENDO is
innovative for its targeted peer navigation and its implementation evaluation in a multisite RCT to inform scale
up. COMPRENDO has the potential to increase clinical trial accrual in Hispanics across the age continuum,
enabling the equitable translation of discoveries and therapies, which is a top priority for NCI."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1 pathway have transformed the management of many
advanced cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), but most patients do not receive durable benefit from
these treatments. Whereas many efforts to understand ICI response and resistance in other tumor types have
often focused on investigating the role of total mutation burden (and consequent neoantigen load) or total T cell
infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (i.e. “hot” vs. “cold” tumors), RCC is biologically distinct from other
immunogenic solid tumors. In contrast to other solid tumors, the total mutation burden does not correlate with
response to ICI in RCC. Further, despite its relatively modest tumor mutational load, RCC stands out as one of
the most highly CD8+ T cell-infiltrated solid tumors at baseline, but the degree of CD8+ T cell infiltration into the
tumor-immune microenvironment (TME) does not associate with ICI response. These observations highlight the
gaps in our knowledge of the somatic alterations and infiltrating immune cell composition, phenotypic states, and
cellular interactions that mediate an effective immune response against RCC in the context of ICI. Thus, there is
a critical need to better understand the disease-specific mechanisms of response and resistance to current ICI-
based therapies in RCC, which may also uncover the general principles of how a modest mutation burden tumor
like RCC can be immunogenic. Prior smaller-scale analyses in RCC identified tumor-intrinsic somatic alterations
that impact ICI response in RCC, and co-occurring and interacting immune populations (terminally exhausted
CD8+ T cells and immunosuppressive macrophages) that are enriched in advanced disease. We therefore
hypothesize that somatic alterations and the TME interact to explain the unique immune landscape of RCC and
modulate response to ICI. By leveraging our expertise in immunogenomic analysis and our close collaborations
with academic and industry partners, we are now uniquely poised to address this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we seek
to systematically define the recurrent somatic alterations that impact immune infiltration and therapeutic
response through the interrogation of large-scale genomic data (whole exome sequencing and bulk RNA-
sequencing) from over 2,800 RCC tumors (including over 1,500 RCC tumors treated with ICI). In Aim 2, we strive
to uncover the cell composition and cellular interactions within the TME that mediate response to ICI through
large-scale single-cell transcriptomic analysis of 96 pre-treatment RCC tumor specimens (including 75 tumors
subsequently treated with ICI). We aim to validate inferred interactions using advanced spatial phenotyping
methods and through functional interrogation using an ex vivo patient-derived tumor fragment model. Overall,
this work will identify genetic and immune determinants of effective ICI-mediated anti-tumor immunity in RCC,
and will nominate specific therapeutically targetable immune inhibitory interactions in the TME for clinical
translation for patients with RCC (and potentially other low and intermediate mutation burden tumors)."

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method FDA-approved to
treat major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, and also used off-label for treating numerous
neurological and psychiatric disorders. Clinical high frequency (HF) rTMS is typically targeted to the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) and is thought to enhance cortical excitability. However, effects on activity and clinical efficacy are
highly variable and the detailed mechanisms of action are not known. The primary obstacle limiting investigation
of cell-type and circuit-specific mechanisms is lack of established animal models with strong face validity. Our
lab has acquired the first rodent TMS coil capable of generating focal, suprathreshold stimulation of a cortical
subregion. We will use this coil to address the cell-type specific mechanisms by which HF-rTMS modifies
excitatory and inhibitory prefrontal subnetworks in vivo. By combining rTMS with cutting edge neuroscience tools,
we will test the hypothesis that HF-rTMS enhances prefrontal excitability by rapidly suppressing activity in
inhibitory neurons leading to subsequent enhancement of principal neuron activity. In Aim 1, we will use fiber
photometry to record calcium signals arising from excitatory (Emx1+) and inhibitory (PV+) prefrontal networks
before, during and after delivery of clinical HF-rTMS. In Aim 2, we will combine these cell-type specific recordings
of neural activity with optogenetic stimulation of long-range cortical inputs to determine how HF-rTMS modifies
synaptically-evoked activity in excitatory vs. inhibitory cortical networks. This proposal addresses a pressing
need to understand the cell-type and circuit specific mechanisms that mediate the effects of rTMS on cortical
function. Our research can inform the rational design of more effective rTMS treatments that precisely target
specific deficits underlying the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. These foundational studies will support
future projects aimed at determining how chronic rTMS can reverse pathological circuit changes in rodent stress
models."
10824437,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease whose clinical complications, including myocardial infarction (MI)
and stroke, are the leading causes of death worldwide. Given the compelling evidence that inflammation plays a key
role in development of atherosclerosis, the expectation was that lipid lowering, combined with global suppression of
inflammation, would markedly reduce late-stage disease complications. The CANTOS clinical trial testing an
IL1 antibody, Canakinumab, provided compelling evidence validating the inflammation hypothesis. However, the
drug failed to get FDA approval due to it having modest beneficial effects including no reduction in cardiovascular
death (CVD) but a 40% increase in death due to lethal infection. The reasons for the disappointing results of CANTOS
are complex but likely were due in part to IL1β antibody treatment inhibiting not only detrimental pro-inflammatory
responses, but also evolutionarily conserved beneficial inflammatory processes necessary for injury-repair including
formation and maintenance of the ACTA2+ fibrous cap. Consistent with this possibility, we (Gomez et al., 2018 Nature
Medicine) previously showed that IL1 receptor signaling in smooth muscle cells (SMC) is required for their investment
and retention in the protective fibrous cap, and that treatment of SMC lineage tracing Apoe-/- mice with advanced
lesions for 8-weeks with a murine IL1 antibody resulted in multiple detrimental effects including a >50% reduction in
SMC number and collagen content within the fibrous cap. Our study is just one of many examples illustrating how
pro-inflammatory signaling may have beneficial or detrimental effects on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. As
such, there is a need to identify more nuanced approaches for inhibiting the adverse effects of chronic inflammation
without eliminating beneficial functions essential for tissue repair, immune resistance to pathogens, and inflammation
resolution. Studies in this proposal will test the hypothesis that selective inhibition of interleukin 6 (IL-6) trans signaling
alone, rather than inhibition of both trans and classic IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) signaling, is not only preferred to avoid
immuno-deficiencies, but is also required to see optimal atherosclerosis-protective effects because of offsetting
beneficial effects of inhibiting IL-6 trans signaling versus detrimental effects of inhibiting classical IL-6R signaling. We
will test this hypothesis as follows. Aim 1 will determine if IL-6 and IL-6R neutralizing antibodies, which inhibit both
IL-6 classic and trans signaling, versus the IL6/sIL-6R trap sgp130Fc, which selectively inhibits only IL-6 trans
signaling, differentially alter lesion development or pathogenesis including cell-matrix composition and indices of
stability. We will do prevention and late stage intervention studies in our novel SMC-endothelial cell (EC) dual lineage
tracing Apoe-/-mice, as well as our novel delta CT Ldlr-/-mice which develop advanced coronary artery atherosclerosis
and evidence of spontaneous MI. Aim 2 will define the role of IL-6 trans signaling in EC and SMC in atherosclerosis
development and late-stage lesion pathogenesis. Our approach will be to selectively eliminate IL-6 trans signaling in
these cells by EC- or SMC-specific knock out (KO) of the IL-6 cytokine family signal transducer glycoprotein 130
(gp130) (IL6ST in humans) required for IL-6 signaling in cells like EC and SMC that do not express the IL-6R."

There are significant gaps in our knowledge of how peripheral GFAP+ glia regulate sensory neuronal activity
and their involvement in primary afferent sensitization. The lack of understanding of the roles of peripheral glial
cells, mainly due to our inability of selectively perturbing signaling pathways in subpopulations of peripheral glia
in vivo, presents an important obstacle in developing creative and effective strategies for investigating glial
contribution in chronic diseases. The long-term goal of this project is to target GFAP+ satellite glial cells (SGCs)
for gene therapies for preventing and treating peripheral sensitization. The objective of this proposal is to
identify signaling pathways underlying SGC-neuron interaction in the sensory ganglia, as well as to
characterize the translatome changes in sensory SGC signaling involved in visceral pain and bladder
dysfunction. Strong preliminary data and past findings in sensory SGCs in the context of chronic pain led to the
central hypothesis that Gq-GPCR signaling in SGCs potently decreases the excitability and activity in bladder-
projecting sensory neurons and contributes to neural control of bladder functions. This hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that sensory satellite glial Gq-GPCR signaling
decreases bladder afferent sensitivity and alters micturition in physiological conditions and in inflammation-
induced visceral pain and bladder overactivity model; 2) Identify the molecular link between satellite glial Gq-
GPCR activation and decreased sensory neuronal excitability; and 3) Discover the changes in sensory satellite
glial translatome during the onset and chronic phase of inflammation-induced pelvic pain and lower urinary
tract symptoms (LUTS). Under the first aim, targeted and selective gene manipulation in peripheral GFAP+ glia
will be utilized to study the role of SGCs in physiological and pathological regulation of bladder afferent
excitability. In the second aim, the cellular and molecular mechanism underlying SGC-neuron interaction will
be identified in sensory ganglia explants using approaches similar to those used in studying CNS glial-neuronal
interactions in situ. Additional experiments will be performed in vivo to test the therapeutic potential of targeting
the identified signaling pathway(s) for alleviating visceral pain and bladder overactivity in this aim. Under the
third aim, TRAP technology will be employed to identify changes in sensory SGC translatome as a function of
inflammation-induced bladder overactivity and pelvic painin a non-biased manner.The proposed research is
significant because 1) it demonstrates a new pharmacogenetic approach for selectively activating peripheral
glia in vivo, which benefits broader research community in Neuro-urology research; 2) it is expected to fill the
knowledge gap on glial modulation of bladder function, a completely unexplored research field with high
therapeutic potential; 3) it provides the first line of evidence for subsequent pre-clinical and clinical trials of
targeting satellite glial cells and peripheral adenosine receptors in treating pelvic pain; and 4) it lays the
groundwork for genetic analysis on specific subsets of peripheral glia during physiology and disease."

This is the third renewal in a line of inquiry characterizing the neural basis of cognitive maturation through the
adolescent period, a time of critical vulnerability to the emergence of major psychopathology (e.g., schizophrenia,
mood disorders). We will build on findings from the first three grants using a comprehensive cognitive battery and
multimodal neuroimaging, more recently including high field (7T) Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging
(MRSI), Tissue Iron, and Magnetization Transfer, indicating important specialization in cognitive brain systems
during adolescence underlied by changes in neurotransmitters and myelination. We now propose to investigate
the contributions of mechanisms of synaptic plasticity by leveraging advances in high field 7T MRI to characterize
developmental changes in markers of synaptic pruning as well as braking factors of plasticity and their contributions
to the transition from variable executive function in adolescence to stable and reliable cognition in adulthood. Our
Central Hypothesis is that the transition in neurocognition from adolescence to adulthood is underlied by synaptic
pruning in the PFC, triggered by the completion of puberty, establishment of DA availability and formation of peri-
neuronal nets (PNNs), which support the stabilization of cognitive processes and associated brain systems func-
tion. In Aim 1, we will leverage brain phosphorus (31P) Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, to characterize in vivo
in humans phospholipid indices of the developmental trajectory of normative loss of synapses, complemented by
1H MRSI measures of age-related decreases in excitatory glutamate function, which we identified in the last grant;
advanced approaches using DWI to assess neural complexity (NODDI); and microRNA markers of mechanisms
of synaptic plasticity. We hypothesize that PME/PDE (from 31P-MRSI), miRs involved in synaptic pruning, NODDI,
and glutamate (from 1H-MRSI) will show associated changes through adolescence stabilizing in the second decade
of life. In Aim 2, we will characterize associations between synaptic pruning and neurocognitive development. We
hypothesize that from adolescence to adulthood, stabilization of executive function (EF), variability in brain activa-
tion, and frontostriatal connectivity will be associated with, and mediated by, synaptic pruning, stabilizing to optimal
processing in adulthood. Finally in Aim 3, we will characterize the role of critical period closing factors into adult-
hood. We hypothesize that stability will coincide with growth plate fusion evidence of the completion of puberty and
will be associated with the stabilization of striatal tissue iron indices of DA availability, peripheral levels of miRs
implicated in PNN formation, and increased myelination, which act as closing factors for this window of plasticity.
We will study 192 10-26 year olds who do not have an Axis 1 diagnosis in themselves of a first degree relative and
will be tested in an accelerated cohort design with three time points at 18-month intervals. Together these findings
will provide innovative evidence for neural mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity underlying the unique transi-
tion from adolescence to adult stabilization of neurocognitive processes informing a normative trajectory of matu-
ration, a critical step for discerning vulnerabilities for abnormal development that can lead to psychopathology."
10832656,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Malignant Mesothelioma (MM), particularly the pleural form of this disease, is a treatment-resistant, rapidly fatal
cancer of serosal cells lining the internal body cavities. Exposure to asbestos is causally associated with the
development of MM, and asbestos-induced inflammation is a major contributing factor in this process. In some
families, heterozygous germline mutations in certain cancer-related genes, especially BAP1, predispose to MM,
and mouse models carrying Bap1 mutations have enhanced susceptibility to the carcinogenic effects of
asbestos. Moreover, somatic BAP1 mutations/deletions occur in 50-60% of human MM specimens. Our recent
whole genome sequencing study of MM patients with a family history of cancer uncovered two families with
germline mutations in the Parkinson’s susceptibility gene LRRK2, including a truncating mutation in one family
in which 6 siblings developed pleural MM. We later found loss of LRRK2 protein expression in 61% of primary
pleural MPMs and MPM cell lines from unrelated individuals. LRRK2 has been linked with various cellular
pathways, one of which (NFAT signaling) is implicated in inflammation/immune response and carcinogenesis.
Our broad, long-term objective is to determine if LRRK2 loss contributes to MM formation and progression, in
part, by dysregulating NFAT, and whether targeting this pathway would have significant therapeutic benefits. In
this project, we propose to test whether LRRK2-mediated interactions with NFAT play a key role in asbestos-
induced inflammation and MM tumorigenesis. Our hypothesis is that LRRK2 acts as a tumor suppressor gene
in MM, that loss of LRRK2 expression contributes significantly to MM pathogenesis, and that future therapeutic
approaches exploiting functional attributes associated with LRRK2 loss can lead to improved clinical outcomes
in this disease. Overall, this project seeks to elucidate mechanisms by which inactivation of LRRK2 contributes
to asbestos carcinogenesis and MM development using a combination of cell biological and in vivo approaches.
We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Does LRRK2 loss promote asbestos-induced tumorigenesis? We
will determine if Lrrk2-deficient mice are predisposed to the carcinogenic effects of asbestos, as demonstrated
by accelerated asbestos-induced MM development compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. Additionally, we will
ascertain if the immune tumor microenvironment differs between MMs from Lrrk2-deficient mice and MMs from
WT mice, and if a comparable difference occurs in human MPM. 2) Does LRRK2 loss enhance NFAT-driven
inflammatory signaling? Asbestos is thought to contribute to MPM development by inducing inflammation, and
we propose to test whether LRRK2 suppresses such inflammation by dampening activity of the transcription
factor NFAT. LRRK2 has been shown to bind to the NRON complex, blocking transport of NFAT from the cytosol
to the nucleus when cells are in a resting state. Loss of LRRK2 will therefore be expected to cause NFAT to be
translocated to the nucleus to mediate transcription. Here we will test if this mechanism may explain how LRRK2
loss may potentiate asbestos-induced inflammation and MM tumorigenesis."

Helicobacter pylori is the strongest known risk factor for gastric cancer and interactions between this chronic
pathogen and immune cells dysregulate gastric epithelial signaling pathways that influence carcinogenesis.
One H. pylori oncogenic determinant is the cag type IV secretion system (TFSS) which translocates pro-
inflammatory effectors, such as CagA, into epithelial cells. In studies supported by R01 CA 77955, we
demonstrated that the cag TFSS can also translocate peptidoglycan, which is sensed by the pattern
recognition receptor (PRR), NOD1. However, negative regulation of certain PRRs by chronic pathogens can
increase pro-inflammatory responses and disease, and we have also demonstrated that prolonged H. pylori
infection activates a NOD1-dependent negative feedback loop in gastric epithelial cells, leading to increased
NF-kB activation. These data have driven our recent efforts to more broadly define the consequences of NOD1
suppression using human samples and rodent models; these findings demonstrate that 1) NOD1 expression is
reduced in H. pylori-infected gastric cancer tissue compared with uninvolved tissue, 2) genetic deficiency of
Nod1 significantly increases H. pylori-induced carcinogenesis and expression of the Th9 cytokine IL-9, a key
effector of epithelial damage and inflammation, 3) H. pylori up-regulates expression of the IL-9 receptor in ex
vivo epithelial gastroids, and 4) treatment of H. pylori-infected gastroids with IL-9 leads to enhanced cell
survival within the context of Nod1 deficiency. We have established innovative models (primary
gastroid:macrophage:T cell co-culture systems) that more closely recapitulate the infected gastric niche to
demonstrate that H. pylori upregulates IL-9 production in a cag TFSS-dependent manner. Finally, we have
gastric tissue and sera from a unique longitudinal human cohort in Colombia that includes persons who either
progressed to irreversible premalignant gastric lesions or remained stable, which will provide critical clinical
validation of our mechanistic studies. Our hypothesis is that suppression of NOD1 signaling contributes
to the augmentation in cancer risk conferred by H. pylori by deploying immune responses (Th9) with
carcinogenic potential. We will test this hypothesis via these Specific Aims:
1. Utilize novel rodent models and ex vivo systems to define IL-9-dependent host responses linked to H. pylori-
induced disease progression
2. Validate and extend mechanistic studies focused on H. pylori, IL-9, and NOD1 using samples and H. pylori
strains isolated from persons who did or did not progress towards gastric cancer
3. Use targeted approaches to inhibit IL-9 immune responses within the context of H. pylori infection"

protein that generates most mechanical forces to power the ciliary beating by ATP hydrolysis. OAD
mutations were found in over half of the primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) patients. These mutations
have orthologs in algae and ciliates, which also lead to cilia/flagellar dysfunctions, suggesting that the
lower species and humans have important commonalities on the mechanisms of ciliary motility.
However, lacking an atomic model of most ciliary components has been a main barrier to our
understanding the cilium system. We will use the model systems T. thermophila and C. reinhardtii to
elucidate the cilium assembly and dynein-driven ciliary motility in the following years, with an emphasis
on OAD and its regulation. We aim to reveal the mechanisms in atomic details by a combination of
cryo-EM/ET, correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), biochemistry, cell biology, single-
molecule biophysics, and computational modeling etc. Our aims for the following years are to
understand how OAD arrays are formed in cilia, how OADs coordinate with each other during beating,
how the OAD activity is regulated by other ciliary components (such as central pair) and extracellular
signals, and build an atomic model of axoneme. We will co-develop cryo-EM/ET methods to address
long-standing problems. The revealed mechanisms will provide more accurate information for our
future mutagenesis in mammalian systems and human disease models."

 Neurogenic bladder from congenital myelodysplasia (Spina Bifida) presents lifelong challenges in bladder
management. Even with improved clinical management up to 50% of patients with SB are at increased risk for
development of chronic kidney disease associated with urologic complications of neurogenic bladder. Bladder
management for patients with neurogenic bladder comprises catheterization to promote emptying, medication to
decrease intravesical pressures and inhibit detrusor overactivity, and regular monitoring of bladder function by
urodynamics (UDS). If conservative therapy fails, patients may undergo surgical intervention to enhance capacity
and reduce intravesical pressure to minimize upper tract damage. Regardless, controversy exists over the best
management protocol for the neurogenic bladder. UDS is considered the gold standard for evaluation of lower
urinary tract function and the impetus for intervention. However, UDS is invasive, expensive, subject to
substantial inter-observer variability and not routinely available beyond tertiary care centers. The availability of a
quantitative, non-invasive approach to signal bladder changes that serve as a harbinger of renal deterioration
would advance clinical management of this patient population significantly. Notably, no such markers have been
validated prospectively as independent markers of functional bladder deterioration.
 In preliminary studies, we have identified a panel of urine biomarkers enriched in urine from two models
of neurogenic bladder (human and rodent), but not detected in kidney urine from human patients with
ureteropelvic junction obstruction. This, together with their detection in bladder tissue from rats with neurogenic
bladder strongly suggests that this unique panel reflects pathological bladder wall remodeling as opposed to
renal damage. Based on these observations we hypothesize that our Non-Invasive Markers of Bladder
Deterioration (NIMBLE) represent prognostic markers of deterioration in bladder function in neurogenic
bladder patients. We believe that these markers may also serve as early predictors of upper tract damage in
this population. We will test the hypothesis with the following aims: Aim 1. Determine the association between
bladder-enriched urine biomarkers and functional parameters in a well characterized prospective cohort of
children with neurogenic bladder. Aim 2. Investigate bladder-enriched urine biomarkers, their association with
function and their response to treatment in a longitudinal cohort of children and rodents with neurogenic bladder.
In each aim we will use mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify our unique panel in sample cohorts
with neurogenic bladder, determine their association with functional UDS and their response to pharmacological
intervention. We will also profile the remaining urinary proteome to refine the biomarker panel. At the end of the
project we will know the extent to which our NIMBLE panel reflects functional deterioration of the neurogenic
bladder and how it could be implemented clinically to improve management of SB patients."
10880706,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A long-standing goal in biology is to define the relationship between genotype and phenotype. A major
surprise of the human genome project was that the human genome encodes so few genes despite the
complexity of cell types that compose for example, the human brain. As such it is assumed that
combinatorial gene expression programs are key for specifying the function of specialized cell types such
as neurons. Cell type specific gene expression programs therefore must be encoded by cis- and trans-
non-coding regulatory DNA elements whose function is regulated by the epigenetic code and key proteins
such as transcription factors. Elucidating how non-coding regulatory elements function to program cells will
transform our understanding of human biology, development and disease.
CRISPR/dCas9 technologies enable us to move beyond correlative studies, by editing the epigenome and
determining the direct effect of epigenetic alterations on gene expression. We have created a new
epigenetic editing functional genomics approach that we have named CRISPRoff. CRISPRoff robustly and
specifically writes CpG DNA methylation (5mC) and repressive histone modifications to target loci. We are
proposing to use CRISPRoff to map all genomic regulatory elements that are regulated by 5mC across an
entire human chromosome. In the proposed experiments we will use perturb-seq, which combines pooled
CRISPR screens with a single cell transcriptome readout, to directly measure how deposition of 5mC by
CRISPRoff across an entire chromosome modulates gene expression. This approach will identify genetic
regulatory elements key for induced pluripotent stem cells and neurons, a key step to understanding how
tissue-specific gene expression is controlled. Our proposed research will serve to demonstrate the utility of
this approach and motivate extending this approach to map gene regulatory elements across the entire
human genome. The results of the proposed research will serve as a fundamental resource and roadmap
for a broad community of biomedical scientists and greatly inform our understanding of human biology and
disease."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality: revascularization via coronary
artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a common therapy for CAD, which is performed via either single arterial graft
(SAG) or multiple arterial grafting (MAG) strategies. Whereas arterial grafts have better long-term patency than
vein grafts, data indicates that patients receiving MAG may experience higher perioperative risk. Cardiac
function is known to predict prognosis after CABG, but the impact of different revascularization approaches on
cardiac performance and consequences on clinical outcomes are incompletely understood. In this re-
submission K23 proposal, I will build on my background in cardiothoracic anesthesia and advanced echo
imaging to elucidate the effect of the two different revascularization strategies (SAG vs. MAG) on cardiac
function immediately after CABG and subsequent clinical outcomes, in order to provide a framework for
perioperative management of CABG patients. In Aim 1, I will examine the impact of CABG revascularization
strategy on the change in cardiac function defined by echo strain. I will identify if MAG will result in lower
cardiac performance as quantified by transesophageal echocardiography from baseline to after the operation. I
will also evaluate whether the change echo strain will be associated with medications need to support
hemodynamics. In Aim 2, I will determine the mechanism by which echo strain decreases after CABG.
Myocardial perfusion on contrast-enhanced echo and flowmeter will be utilized to test the association with
cardiac functional change (echo strain). I will also evaluate if MAG will result in lower myocardial perfusion than
will SAG-based revascularization. In Aim 3, I will determine whether the decrease in echo strain predicts
clinical outcomes at 6 months better than conventional imaging indices. By studying the link between
revascularization techniques, cardiac function and physiology, I will lay the groundwork for a research career
translating new insights regarding underlying mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction into meaningful anesthetic
interventions that improve clinical outcomes. Under my strong mentorship team of Drs. Devereux (extensive
expertise in cardiovascular imaging trials and cardiac outcomes research), Gaudino (internationally renowned
cardiac surgeon with a focus on multi-arterial grafting and designing randomized clinical trials and m-PI of the
funded parent trial ROMA), and Weinsaft (an expert in quantitative cardiac imaging and translational research),
I will be able to enhance my clinical research skills while obtaining new technical skills advanced
echocardiography and translational research that will allow me to become an independent investigator. In
addition, new skills obtained from my K23 will directly guide the design of a planned R01 to (a) to assess LV
response to vasoactive medications designed to improve arterial graft flow in CABG patients and (b) test
vasodilator therapy to improve clinical outcomes in patients with MAG."

 Influenza (Flu) infection is a leading cause of respiratory disease and associated death in the world.
The annual flu epidemics are estimated to result in 3-5 million cases of severe illness and more than 250,000
deaths. A strong effector immunity is desired for viral clearance, it however can lead to immunopathology if not
properly controlled. Severe and fatal influenza diseases are accompanied by an aggressive pro-inflammatory
response and an insufficient anti-inflammatory immunity. The production of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-
10 by flu-specific CD8+ T cells is critical in limiting the lung immunopathology during infection, contributing to
host survival and recovery. Knowing how to identify these regulatory CD8+ T cells and understanding how they
develop and function are essential for learning how to control flu-induced lung immunopathology. This makes
our work highly significant. While much is known about the CD4+ regulatory T cells, the molecular signature
and mechanisms that regulate the development and function of IL-10+ regulatory CD8+ T cells remain poorly
understood, particularly in the context of influenza-induced airway inflammation. We recently generated an IL-
10GFP/Foxp3RFP dual reporter mouse model that enables detection of IL-10 and Foxp3 in live cells, and
undertook a screening for the presence of IL-10+ and/or Foxp3+ T cells under normal and pulmonary
inflammatory conditions. We found that Foxp3- IL-10+ CD8+ T cells are present in various organs and disease
conditions, and are the major contributors to IL-10 production in the airway during influenza infection. These
Foxp3- IL-10+ CD8+ T cells exhibit profound immunoregulatory function against pro-inflammatory innate and
adaptive immune responses, indicative of a therapeutic potential. There are however no reliable markers for
Foxp3- IL-10+ CD8+ regulatory T cells. We hypothesize that molecular signatures and pathways associated
with the development and function of IL-10-producing regulatory CD8+ T cells can be exploited to
develop therapeutic strategies against influenza-induced lung immunopathology. Our preliminary
studies identified a novel surface signature LAG3hiCD25hiBTLAloCD226lo and the critical transcription
factor TCF1 in IL-10+ CD8+ T cells during influenza infection. We propose experiments in two Specific Aims to:
(1) determine and validate signature surface markers of IL-10-producing regulatory CD8+ T cells; and (2)
determine the role of TCF1 in IL-10-producing regulatory CD8+ T cell development and function. This work is
highly innovative as we utilize comprehensive biochemical, genetic and genomics approaches with unique
transgenic mouse models, and have exciting preliminary data that can be expanded to provide information of
surface markers and critical signaling pathways for a better understanding of the development and
immunoregulatory function of IL-10-producing CD8+ T cells during Influenza infection. We expect to unravel
potential molecular mechanisms through which flu-induced pathogenesis can be better controlled, which may
enhance our ability of developing strategies to control virus-induced immunopathology, morbidity and mortality."
10876424,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We are witnessing a paradigmatic shift in the practice of medicine whereby the concept of targeting RNAs
as diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are rapidly evolving. Lon noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a highly
heterogeneous group of non-coding transcripts that participate in the regulation of almost every stage of gene
expression, as well as being involved in a variety of disease states. Dysregulation of several lncRNAs have
also been implicated in progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN) and because of the tissue-specific
characteristics of lncRNAs, they are considered as the next generation of biomarkers and promising
therapeutic targets for DN progression
 In the last funding cycle, our lab provided strong evidence that lncRNATug1 is down regulated in several
experimental models of DN and in patients with Type 2 diabetes (Long, et al. JCI, 2016). Importantly,
conditional overexpression of Tug1 in podocytes mitigated progression of DN. We also published our findings
demonstrating that Tug1-mediated renoprotection in DN is accomplished through a PGC1a-dependent
mechanisms on mitochondrial function. Thus, we proposed that Tug1 serves as a novel therapeutic target in
DN progression.
 Our work over the last five years suggests that Tug1 has two major effects on mitochondrial function: 1)
Tug1 impacts mitochondrial function indirectly through a PGC1a-dependent mechanism in the nucleus, and 2)
we now provide preliminary data suggesting that Tug1 is also translocated from the nucleus to mitochondria.
However, the impact of mitochondrial-associated Tug1 (mitoTug1) remains unknown. We also provide
preliminary data that Tug1 transcripts localized to the cytoplasm is translated into micropeptides. Several
lncRNAs have been shown to hide small open reading frames (sORFs) encoding for small functional peptides
termed micropeptides. Our preliminary findings suggest a direct effect of Tug1 encoded micropeptide on
mitochondrial function. However, its role on mitochondrial homeostasis and progression of DN is unknown.
 In this application, we propose a convergent model of Tug1-mediated impact on mitochondrial remodeling
in DN. Two fundamental questions will be addressed: 1) First, elucidating the subcellular distribution and
function of mitochondrial-associated Tug1 (mitoTug1) on mitochondrial homeostasis and progression of DN,
and 2) Second, identifying the biological and pathological role of a Tug1-encoded micropepetide on
mitochondrial function and DN progression. We will describe the various techniques and strategies to study the
potential role of Tug1 on mitochondrial remodeling, the challenges to these approaches, and our published and
preliminary data. The successful completion of our application will place high priority on developing strategies
to target Tug1 as a potential candidate in future clinical studies, and open a rich field for investigation on the
interorganelle communication and mitochondrial metabolism in the pathogenesis of DN."

Critically ill patients admitted to the ICU who develop secondary infection and sepsis, can face up to a five-fold
increase in the risk for death when compared to non-sepsis patients. The majority of patients who developed
secondary infections are more critically ill at admission and therefore require significantly greater resources.
Traditional machine learning algorithms for predicting sepsis has been largely focused and relied on the use of
structured data from the electronic medical record (EMR), however the EMR was developed largely as a billing
mechanism and an audit log for clinical workflow. Hence, much of the structure and availability of data are often
time-delayed, prone to errors from manual entry, biases from various institutional, personal and training biases,
and finally contain a significant amount of missing data. In this proposal, we seek to discover novel
`physiomarkers' extracted from continuous physiological data streams, generated from non-human derived data
sources, that predict the onset of sepsis in this critical population. Using such routinely collected data, along with
common clinical indicators extracted from the EMR, we propose to generate robust machine learning algorithms
that can be more generalized, reproducible and removed from the biases and pitfalls of manual data entry. We
propose that such classes of models not only may alert clinicians to acute and critically ill patients at risk for
developing sepsis in real-time, but also investigate intervention effectiveness, such as volume responsiveness
and support the discovery of novel sub-types of sepsis. Secondly, much of the existing literature on predictive
models for sepsis focus on hospitalized patients in the general ward, however, models that predict the onset of
sepsis among patients who developed secondary infections after admission to the ICU is limited. In our previous
work, we have demonstrated that markers discovered from continuous numeric data streams can inform earlier
prediction of sepsis in children and adults. However, those analysis did not use high-fidelity data from the
waveforms, which encapsulate rich characteristics of physiology. Therefore, by emphasizing the discovery of
such novel markers and through the application of data-driven learning algorithms, we expect to develop
algorithms and tools that improve our understanding of the changing physiologic dynamics of sepsis in critically
ill patient. In this proposed program, we will integrate knowledge across a number of distinctive expertise that
spans signal processing, mathematics, computer science and medicine to develop sophisticated tools that can
analyze such data to reveal meaningful insight. In short, we will contribute significant knowledge about the role
and utility of complex physiological interactions that are at present abundantly available in clinical practice but
seldom used for clinical decision making."
10868770,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nephrotic syndrome is a leading cause of end stage kidney disease, which is the eighth leading cause of death
in the United States. Thrombin injures podocytes and its inhibition reduces nephrotic-range proteinuria and
podocyte injury, two key drivers of nephrotic syndrome progression toward end stage kidney disease. Thus,
there is a critical need to discern the molecular mechanisms underlying thrombin-mediated podocyte injury
without which, the development of targeted, safe, and effective therapies that slow or halt nephrotic syndrome
progression is likely to remain limited. The overall objective of this proposal is to define molecular mechanisms
underlying thrombin-dependent, protease-activated receptor-mediated podocyte injury and determine if inhibition
of this signaling pathway reduces progression toward end stage kidney disease. The central hypothesis is that
thrombin-mediated protease-activated receptor signaling is a modifiable driver of RhoA-dependent podocyte
injury during nephrotic syndrome progression. This project will integrate methods from the podocyte and
coagulation biology fields including: mouse and rat nephrotic syndrome models, coagulation factor knockdown
and conditional protease-activated receptor knockout mice, innovative nanoparticle-mRNA overexpression of
coagulation factors, repurposing of Food and Drug Administration approved direct oral anticoagulants to mitigate
podocyte injury, a novel flow cytometry approach to quantitate podocyte injury, and molecular biology methods
including bimolecular fluorescence complementation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer in
genetically modified podocyte cultures. These complementary methods will be used to investigate the
pathophysiologic role of thrombin in podocyte injury and nephrotic syndrome progression toward end stage
kidney disease. Our Aims are designed to (1) Reveal the prothrombinase that produces intraglomerular,
podocytopathic thrombin to drive podocyte injury and nephrotic syndrome progression, (2) Test the ability of
direct oral anticoagulant therapy as a novel method to reduce nephrotic syndrome progression, and (3) Discover
the molecular mechanisms by which thrombin-mediated protease-activated receptor signaling stimulates RhoA-
dependent podocyte injury. This project is directly responsive to the mission of the National Institute of Diabetes
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) which is to “…support medical research…on kidney…and
hematologic diseases, to improve people’s health and quality of life.” In addition, this project directly addresses
important research priorities described in the Kidney Research National Dialogue and key aspects of the Healthy
People 2030 Chronic Kidney Disease objectives. Completion of the proposed project is expected to establish
the mechanisms underlying thrombin-mediated podocyte injury and enable exploitation of existing, Food and
Drug Administration approved, direct oral anticoagulants as novel therapeutics to slow or halt NS progression."
10889982,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a significant public health problem affecting ~30 million American. Obesity,
insulin resistance, insulin deficiency (β cell dysfunction) and dysglycemia all precede the diagnosis of T2D and
are known to promote inflammation and ultimately lead to microvascular complications. More recently, research
has identified brain-related complications in adult-onset T2D, including reduced regional brain structure and
function, impaired cognition, and increased lifetime risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Alarmingly, an increasing
number of children and adolescents are being diagnosed with T2D, likely due to the growing prevalence and
earlier onset of obesity. Youth-onset T2D appears to have a more aggressive course than adult-onset T2D, with
earlier onset and more rapid progression of microvascular complications. In addition, studies of youth with
obesity and youth-onset T2D have reported robust differences in regional brain structure and cognition,
suggesting that brain effects may follow the same aggressive course as the more typical vascular complications.
Unfortunately, little is known about the factors associated with poor brain structure and function in youth with
T2D. To address this critical gap in knowledge, we propose to study youth across the spectrum of body mass
index (BMI) and metabolic dysfunction. This approach will allow us to disentangle the relationship of key features
of T2D risk (e.g. obesity) with intermediary physiologic changes that pose a risk for the brain (e.g. insulin
resistance, inflammation, β-cell dysfunction and dysglycemia) that may lead to reduced brain structure and
function in T2D. We will determine which of these factors are most associated with differences in brain structure
and function among groups, over time, and how these effects differ from normal neurodevelopment. Given that
the disease occurs at a time when brains are undergoing dramatic developmental processes, the aggressive
nature of youth-onset T2D progression and complications in other organ systems, these results may provide
guidance and justification for longer follow-up, interventional or mechanistic studies and have important clinical
implications."

Neonatal stroke and hypoxia-ischemia (HI) brain injury remains a leading cause of a lifelong neurological
handicap. The only currently accepted approach is post-ischemic hypothermia. However, no exact therapeutic
mechanisms of this approach are known. A growing body of experimental evidence showed that omega-3 (n-3)
fatty acids (FAs) and their bioactive metabolites protect developing brain against HI-reperfusion injury. Using
triglyceride emulsions we showed that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) provided strong neuroprotection against HI
brain injury in different rodent models. This neuroprotection was associated with increased DHA content in
cerebral mitochondria, preserved mitochondrial function in reperfusion and coupled with a dramatic (3 to 15 fold)
elevation of DHA metabolites, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) and other specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs),
specifically in the ischemic brain. We have reasoned that beneficial action of DHA may be exerted by its
metabolites. Among tested SPMs, only NPD1 significantly attenuated HI brain damage in mice. Administration
of NPD1 also suppressed activation of Ca2+ induced mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore
(mPTP) and apoptotic death pathway by blocking BAX-mitochondria interaction. In this renewal application, we
hypothesize that DHA-derived bioactive mediator, NPD1 a) modifies the matrix mitochondrial membrane
properties that attenuate activation of mPTP, b) prevents mitochondrial outer membrane interaction with BAX.
These effects attenuate post-ischemic secondary energy failure and mitochondrial apoptotic cell death pathway,
contributing/explaining the neuroprotective mechanisms afforded by DHA. This hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims. Aim 1: To determine the role of exogenous NPD1 and DHA in attenuation of BAX-driven
mitochondrial cell death following HI brain injury. In this aim, we will compare the potency of DHA or NPD1 in
limiting BAX-mediated cellular death. Given that both compounds demonstrated beneficial changes in
mitochondrial functions (Ca2+ buffering and respiration (DHA) and Ca2+ buffering (NPD1)) after HI insult, we were
focused on determining the fate of exogenous DHA and its metabolite, NPD1 by tracing deuterated 2H10-DHA in
the ischemic brain, and mitochondria/mitoplasts isolated from the ischemic hemisphere. Aim 2: To determine the
origin of increased brain NPD1 after acute injection of DHA and distribution of NPD1 and exogenous DHA
following HI injury). Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine potential actions of NPD1 or/and DHA on preserving an
integrity of the inner mitochondrial membrane, directly testing electrical conductance driven by the presence or
absence of permeability transition. Our proposal is a translational study with a focus on specific mechanisms of
neuroprotection targeting post-ischemic mitochondria using innovative approaches toward an understanding a
temporal role of mitochondrial permeability transition in secondary energy failure and cell injury. Translational
impacts are defined by the neuroprotective strength and clinical utility of DHA metabolites, rather than DHA itself."

Angelman syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder caused by maternal allele deletions of UBE3A.
In neurons, the paternal allele of UBE3A is epigenetically silenced. Unsilencing the paternal allele of UBE3A
offers a potentially transformative opportunity for treating Angelman syndrome. We recently discovered a small
molecule that unsilences the paternal allele of UBE3A in neurons cultured from Angelman syndrome model
mice or from stem cells derived from Angelman syndrome individuals. When delivered noninvasively to
Angelman syndrome model mice, this small molecule leads to brain-wide neuronal UBE3A protein expression
without observable toxicity. We hypothesize that our small molecule approach can reverse Angelman
syndrome phenotypes in mice, justifying its advance towards additional safety studies and future clinical trials.
Towards developing this approach as a non-invasive treatment for Angelman syndrome, we propose to (1)
establish rescue of behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes in Angelman syndrome model mice, (2)
identify the mechanism of action by which our small molecule produces unsilencing of paternal UBE3A, and (3)
perform structure-activity-relationship studies to improve efficacy and maximize favorable pharmacology. By
advancing the first small molecule treatment of Angelman syndrome, this research may lead to therapy yielding
profound lifelong benefits for this patient population."

Mutations in Crumbs homologue-1 (CRB1) gene cause severe inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs). Worldwide
~80,000 CRB1 patients are affected, with a prevalence in the United States of 1 in 86,500. There is no treatment
available. Gene augmentation in Crb mouse models has shown mixed results, with successful proof-of-concept
(POC) using family member CRB2 but only limited morphological and no functional benefits in addition to adverse
effects using CRB1-A. CRB1 proteins localize adjacent to adherens junctions and are essential in maintaining
their stability in photoreceptors (PRCs) and Müller glial cells (MGCs). The role of CRB1 in retinal development
and disease has been focused on CRB1-A. However, three human retinal CRB1 isoforms exist: CRB1-A, the
human specific CRB1-C, and the newly identified CRB1-B. In mice, CRB1-A and CRB1-B operate in different
cell types (MGCs and PRCs, respectively). Our long-term goal is to halt the progressive retinal degeneration
found in CRB1 IRD patients. Our preliminary data confirm the predominate cell-type-distinct localizations of
CRB1-A and CRB1-B in addition to the localization of CRB1-C in human cadaveric retina and induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC)-derived retinal organoids. Further, the majority of CRB1 mutations affect more than one CRB1
isoform. Consequently, the objective of this grant is to determine an isoform-independent approach to treat
CRB1 IRDs. Prime editing is a double-strand break-independent gene editing system that can correct all
mutation types. Our central hypothesis is that prime editing is amenable to the correction of CRB1 mutations,
allowing us to develop the tools necessary to ascertain its therapeutic efficacy in post-mitotic retinal cells. This
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following three specific aims. Aim 1 (c.2843>A) and Aim 2 (c.3307G>A)
will assess if prime editing is amenable for the installation and correction of CRB1 mutations and define its safety
profile by evaluating off-targeting of the most efficient strategies. Further Aim 1 and 2 will characterize
phenotypic, histopathological, and molecular changes in the derived retinal organoids. Lastly, in Aim3 we will
define if a lentiviral all-in-one or AAV split-intein prime editing strategy is most amenable to perform post-mitotic
editing in retinal organoids. Impact: Results of this novel project would create new CRB1 retinal organoid disease
models, identify therapeutic outcome measures for CRB1 IRDs, and define the efficiency and safety profile for
prime editing tools for the amelioration of CRB1 IRDs. This proposal is innovative, as our approach would
correct all CRB1 isoforms affected by a given CRB1 mutation. Excitingly, the successful completion of this
project will establish a preclinical pathway for showing POC for CRB1 prime editing therapeutics."

This research proposal from a multi-disciplinary team including ophthalmologists and biomedical engineers
seeks to improve the imaging and characterization of posterior eye deformities such as in progressive or
pathologic myopic and high intracranial pressure. The three-dimensional changes seen in the posterior eye
with these diseases have usually been characterized using neuro-imaging. To make this assessment more
available in the clinical ophthalmic setting, we will further develop our “whole eye” optical coherence
tomography (OCT) system specifically for this application. This OCT system will have hardware and software
innovations to quantitatively assess the three-dimensional deformation of the posterior eye in these diseases.
With these data, we can identify shape metrics which can help to distinguish pathologic from “regular” high
myopia, progressive from non-progressive myopia, and for high intracranial pressure, we will assess the
evolution of the eye deformation in the posterior eye over the patient’s care.
These developments have both direct immediate clinical and research applicability by providing imaging
biomarkers to characterize posterior eye deformation. In addition, given that a whole eye OCT system will be
deployed to a second site, there will be a demonstration of the applicability of this technology outside the origin
laboratory."
10866549,"TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is an essential DNA/RNA-binding protein that plays a major role in RNA
processing and stability. Although predominantly nuclear in localization, over 95% of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) cases and up to half of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases show mislocalization of TDP-43
to the cytoplasm. Substantial evidence links TDP-43 mislocalization to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration
in ALS/FTD, and TDP-43 mutations have been identified in subset of familial ALS cases, further supporting a
primary role for TDP-43 disruption in disease. However, the cause of TDP-43 nuclear clearance in ALS/FTD
remains unknown. A major barrier has been lack of understanding of the mechanism of TDP-43 nuclear export.
Until recently, TDP-43 was thought to be a cargo of the nuclear export receptor, exportin-1 (XPO1). However,
multiple recent studies demonstrate that XPO1 does not bind TDP-43 or mediate its export. Alternative export
mechanisms may include passive diffusion from the nucleus, or active co-export with RNA, such as via the
NXF1/TREX mRNA export complex. Our preliminary data show that TDP-43 nuclear export is ATP- and RNA-
dependent, but the energy may be required upstream of the pore, for TDP-43 intranuclear mobility, rather than
translocation across the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Indeed, a permeabilized cell assay suggests that, once
displaced from nuclear RNA, TDP-43 likely diffuses out of the nucleus. Moreover, studies in an NXF1 auxin-
inducible degron (AID) cell line suggest that the bulk mRNA pathway is not required for TDP-43 export. Based
on these data, we hypothesize that ATP-dependent nuclear tethering of TDP-43, most likely to nuclear RNA,
critically dictates the rate at which it diffuses into the cytoplasm. In the proposed studies, we will perform an
arrayed CRISPRi and CRISPRa screen of a targeted library to determine the mechanism of energy-dependent
nuclear tethering of TDP-43. Hits will be validated in nuclear transport and photobleaching assays, and also
evaluated in ALS/FTD patient tissue. We will then combine high content microscopy with nucleocytoplasmic
transport assays, including a newly developed permeabilized cell export assay, to confirm the mechanism of
TDP-43 translocation across the nuclear pore during export. Additional AID cell lines and knockdown studies
will be used to definitively exclude a role for the mRNA export pathway. Finally, we will test the therapeutic
efficacy of a novel approach to promote TDP-43 nuclear retention, identified during our preliminary studies.
Testing will include TDP-43 mutant Drosophila (in collaboration with the Daniela Zarnescu lab), TDP-43 mutant
iNeurons, and mouse sciatic nerve axotomy, to determine if we can promote TDP-43 nuclear retention in vivo,
and whether this strategy will attenuate molecular and neuropathologic features of TDP-43 proteinopathy.
These studies will enable a precise mechanistic understanding of the mechanism and regulation of TDP-43
nuclear export, and advance preclinical testing of a candidate strategy to promote TDP-43 nuclear retention."
10828420,"Abstract: An important unmet clinical need for patients with the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS)
is an effective method for promoting remyelination that can ameliorate clinical symptoms associated with
demyelination and restore motor function while limiting immune cell infiltration into the CNS. The long-term
objectives of this research proposal are to i) define how chemokine signaling controls neuroinflammation and
disease progression, ii) assess the effects of chemokine signaling in regulating oligodendrocyte progenitor cell
(OPC) maturation and remyelination, iii) further characterize how engrafted human and mouse neural
progenitor cells enhance axonal integrity, promote remyelination and influence
neuroinflammation/demyelination, iv) define mechanisms by which microglia restrict the severity of
demyelination and influence remyelination. To accomplish these goals, we will use a well-accepted pre-clinical
animal models of MS. For over 20 years, my laboratory has used intracranial infection of susceptible C57BL/6
mice with the neuroadapted JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) as a model of viral-induced
demyelination to study molecular and cellular events controlling neurioinflammation, demyelination, and
remyelination. Proposed experimental procedures that will aid in accomplishing our research goals will include
genetic approaches through generation of mice in which targeted genes are either selectively induced/ablated
to assess effect on disease progression and repair, CRISPR technology to ablate specific target genes in NPC
cultures, single cell and nuclear RNA sequencing on immune cells and resident CNS cells and use of 2-photon
(2P) microscopy to visualize axonal damage/repair and remyelination. Collectively, we believe our
experimental goals outlined in this proposal will provide new insight into the pathogenesis of MS as well as
identify new targets for therapeutic intervention to impede disease progression and promote remyelination."

epithelial cells to produce muco-obstructive pathology, a central feature of severe asthma and a major contributor
to fatality from this disease. Our Center has made major contributions to identifying type 2 high asthma as the
major asthma endotype, demonstrating that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 acts directly on airway epithelial cells to
induce pathological changes in mucus, and showing that mucus plugging is a persistent feature of asthma that
is associated with type 2 responses and with increased asthma severity. The overall objective of this proposal is
to understand molecular mechanisms that account for alterations in secretory cell and mucus function that are
important in severe asthma. The overarching hypothesis that serves as the focus of this renewal is that local
type 2 immune responses induce IL-13-mediated changes in epithelial gene expression and that these changes,
which involve several novel molecular mechanisms not previously explored, alter differentiation of secretory cells
and production and secretion of mucins, leading to mucus plugging and airway obstruction. The proposal
includes two highly related projects, each of which focuses on molecules and pathways that have previously
unknown roles in secretory cell biology and mucus dysfunction. Project 1 will determine the roles of the
tetraspanin TSPAN8, which we recently found to be required for stimulated release of MUC5AC, the major
component of mucus plugs, and investigate the contributions of cysteine proteases and cystatin inhibitors
implicated in our preliminary studies of mucociliary clearance in IL-13-stimulated primary human bronchial
epithelial cells (HBECs). In addition, project 1 will directly assess the relationships between type 2 immune
responses, epithelial alterations, and mucus plugging by analyzing lung tissue and HBECs from individuals with
asthma and controls. Project 2 focuses on understanding new findings showing key roles for airway epithelial
miRNAs in the miR-141/200 family and particular portions of the ER stress response in secretory cell
differentiation, pathologic mucus production, and mucus plugging in asthma. Every aim of both projects depends
upon a Clinical Subject and Biospecimen Processing and Analysis Core that will study banked lung specimens
(for detailed molecular studies of mucus plugs, including from fatal asthma), conduct a new bronchoscopy-based
study to obtain freshly isolated cells, provide banked human bronchial epithelial cells, and store, analyze, and
disseminate data. The Administrative Core will coordinate our Center and our interactions with other AADCRCs
and NIAID. The proposed studies will provide new mechanistic insights that are highly relevant to the
pathogenesis of severe asthma and may lead to novel therapeutic targets that address unmet needs."
10809779,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE SUMMARY
The Administrative Core will be responsible for program coordination, communication with outside entities, and
fiscal management. The core will be led by the PI, Dr. David Erle, who has substantial experience with leading
large NIH-funded multi-investigator programs. The Administrative Core will coordinate activities of the two
projects and the Clinical Subject and Biospecimen Processing and Analysis Core to ensure that critical
information and biospecimens are shared efficiently. The Administrative Core will arrange monthly AADCRC
conferences and meetings with the internal advisory committee and external advisors. We will continue to seek
opportunities to use AADCRC infrastructure and opportunity funds to support a diverse group of early-stage
investigators working to establish careers related to asthma and allergic diseases and to support collaborations
with other AADCRCs. The PI will participate in monthly conference calls with NIAID staff and leaders of other
AADCRCs and will work with other program personnel to ensure we are well-represented at the annual
AADCRC meetings in Bethesda. The PI will work closely with an experienced administrative staff member to
ensure that AADCRC funds are spent wisely and according to all applicable NIH regulations."
10809781,"CLINICAL CORE SUMMARY
The Clinical Subject and Biospecimen Processing and Analysis Core will provide a core resource that will be
required for each aim of both projects. The core will 1) conduct unique processing and novel analysis of inflated
lung specimens from individuals with and without asthma across areas with and without mucus plugs, 2) recruit,
characterize, and sample airway tissue from human subjects in a clinical study, and 3) process and distribute
biospecimens and data to the projects. Dr. Nirav Bhakta (Core Director), along with a team consisting of a
research coordinator, a technician, and a programmer analyst, have considerable experience in all aspects of
recruiting human subjects for translational research protocols, and collecting and banking high-quality
biospecimens. Co-investigator Dr. Tillie Hackett directs a large lung tissue biospecimen bank, The James Hogg
Lung Registry at University of British Columbia, and has developed state of the art methods for detailed molecular
characterization of lung tissue. Using the resources of this highly experienced and well-resourced group, the
core will have three aims. Aim 1 is to identify immune and airway epithelial features associated with asthma and
mucus plugging in banked lung tissue; this includes single-cell, imaging mass cytometry and gene expression
profiling to measure proteins, mRNAs, and miRNAs in lungs from individuals with fatal and non-fatal asthma and
COPD and controls without airway disease. This data will support both projects. Aim 2 is to collect high quality
biospecimens from a new bronchoscopy study using systems and methods which ensure compliance with
federal and local regulations. This will support studies in both projects that require freshly harvested cells. Aim 3
is to provide specialized processing, secure storage, and timely distribution of human biospecimens and data to
both projects and coordinate deposition of data into the publicly accessible NIAID ImmPort database. In addition
to providing very high quality clinical phenotyping and biological specimens from human donors and subjects,
this core will process and distribute epithelial brushings from bronchoscopy and from donor lungs for subsequent
culture, cryopreservation, and single-cell RNA sequencing. Dr. Bhakta and the UCSF Airway Clinical Research
Center in which he conducts human studies have a track record of success in human subjects recruitment,
characterization, and research bronchoscopy, and in the processing, banking, database recording and
distribution of high-quality biospecimens and RNA, as well as linking of molecular and cellular assays to safely
handled and validated databases of associated clinical data. Research conducted by Dr. Hackett and colleagues
from The James Hogg Lung Registry is notable for the methods of inflating donor lungs and imaging them with
CT scanning to enable the comparison of not only the pathology but also molecular (RNA, DNA, protein) profiles
of diseased lungs compared to healthy donor controls. Given that human studies are an integral component of
this grant application, this core will be critical for the successful performance of each project and for establishing
the clinical significance of the scientific studies proposed within them."
10809783,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
Mucus plugging is a major cause of cause of airway obstruction, morbidity, and mortality in severe asthma. Work
performed in our Center has helped to establish a strong association between type 2 inflammation and mucus
plugging and has revealed that direct effects of the type 2 cytokine IL-13 on airway epithelium induce changes
in the composition and organization of mucus that result in plugging. The overall objective of this project is to
understand novel molecular mechanisms that alter secretory cell and mucus function in asthma. In Aim 1, we
will build on new preliminary data showing that the IL-13-inducible goblet cell protein, tetraspanin 8 (TSPAN8) is
required for stimulated mucin release. Based upon our results and existing information about other tetraspanins,
we hypothesize that TSPAN8-enriched microdomains in goblet cells play critical roles in mediating intracellular
signals required for mucin secretion and in the organization and function of mucin-containing secretory granules.
We will test this hypothesis using primary human bronchial epithelial cells and in a mouse model, which will allow
us to determine the importance of this molecule in vivo. In Aim 2, we will investigate the impact of cathepsin
cysteine proteases and their inhibitors on mucus. Cystatin SN and cystatin S are human cysteine protease
inhibitors (absent in mice). We found that these cystatins are strongly induced by IL-13 and in type 2-high asthma
and that CRISPR targeting either cystatin or addition of excess cathepsin to mucus prevents IL-13-induced
impairments in mucociliary clearance. We hypothesize that these cystatin SN and cystatin S impair mucociliary
clearance by inhibiting cathepsin-mediated degradation of mucins and activation of ENaC, a channel that is
important for mucus hydration and mucociliary transport. We will test this hypothesis by using in vitro assays to
study the biochemical functions of relevant cathepsins and cystatins and by assessing the physiologic role of
these molecules in the primary HBEC culture model. In Aim 3, we will test whether mucus plugging in lung
specimens from individuals with asthma is associated with strong local type 2 immune responses and prominent
IL-13-related epithelial changes. Preliminary data from our Center and others is consistent with the hypothesis
that mucus plugging occurs in the setting of a strong local type 2 immune response and strong epithelial cell
induction of the mucin MUC5AC after exposure to IL-13. We will test this hypothesis by comparing IL-13
responses in epithelial cells from individuals with asthma and controls and by collaborating closely with the
Clinical Subject and Biospecimen Processing and Analysis Core to obtain detailed spatial cellular and
transcriptional data about immune and epithelial states associated with mucus plugs. The impact of this work
will be to substantially advance our understanding of known and novel pathways responsible for formation and
persistence of mucus plugs, and by doing so provide new clues to therapeutic approaches likely to benefit those
with the most severe forms of asthma."
10809788,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
Mucus plugging is common in severe asthma, is associated with type 2 inflammation and poor lung function and
persists despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids. Mucus plugging is also a critical feature of fatal asthma.
Consequently, although we have made significant progress in targeting airway inflammation in asthma, there is
still an unmet need for therapeutic approaches that directly prevent or treat pathological mucus and mucus
plugging. The overall objectives of this project are to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the
differentiation and function of goblet cells that produce airway mucins and secrete pathological mucus in human
asthma and to develop pre-clinical data on two novel therapeutic approaches that target these processes. In Aim
1, we propose to determine the roles of miR-141/200 family members in epithelial cell differentiation, pathological
mucus production, and airway mucus plugging in asthma. Of the highly homologous five-member miR-141/200
miRNA family, our preliminary data implicate miR-141 in goblet cell differentiation, mucin production and mucus
secretion. However, our data suggest that other members of this microRNA family also play a role in these
processes. We propose to test the hypothesis that miR-141/200 family members are important for the transition
of basal cells to secretory cells, mucin production and mucus secretion, playing roles that are complementary
(or even antagonistic) to miR-141. We will also test the hypothesis that these miR-141/200 family members
localize to epithelial cells at sites of type 2 inflammation and mucus plugging in human asthma and are
associated with severe disease. In Aim 2 we propose to determine the mechanisms underlying IRE1α regulation
of secretory epithelial cell differentiation and pathological mucus production. Our preliminary data show that
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway activation and activation of IRE1α
kinase endoribonuclease (RNase) are increased during secretory cell differentiation in patients with asthma. We
also show that conditional deletion of IRE1α in the murine airway epithelium or inhibition with a novel small
molecule inhibitor (KIRA8) in human airway epithelial cells, inhibit goblet cell metaplasia and airway epithelial
mucin production. IRE1α may mediate these effects through two distinct outputs: an “adaptive” mode which
typically promotes homeostasis, and a “terminal” mode, which leads to maladaptive cellular outcomes. Recently
we have developed another novel small molecule inhibitor, PAIR2, which specifically inhibits the terminal mode
of UPR activation. In this aim, we propose to test the hypotheses that IRE1α inhibition decreases goblet cell
metaplasia by inhibiting the transition of basal cells into a transitional secretory cell state, that terminal UPR
activation mechanistically connects IRE1α to goblet cell metaplasia (which can be inhibited by PAIR2), and that
terminal UPR signaling pathway is increased in human asthma and especially in severe asthma at sites of mucus
plugging. Successful completion of the studies proposed here would identify new therapeutic opportunities for
the treatment of pathological mucus and mucus plugging in asthma and other muco-obstructive lung diseases."
10850893,"SUMMARY: Vision loss from age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major, expanding problem due to the
aging population. While treatment is available for intermediate AMD and the advanced wet form, no prevention
or treatment is available for early AMD. While cellular heterogeneity can help tissue adapt to stress, degenerative
heterogeneity from aging is associated with disease. The current perspective is that RPE (retinal pigmented
epithelium) degeneration is a central, chronic process that inevitably leads to cell death. Thus, prior studies have
focused on the impact of RPE cell death on AMD pathobiology. However, a subset of RPE cells exhibit features
of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an adaptive process that allows cells to survive a harsh environment.
RPE heterogeneity has been recognized for some time, but the impact of disease driving cell subsets on AMD
pathogenesis has not been considered. Lysosomal dysfunction is clearly involved in several age-related
diseases including AMD, but the impact of heterogeneity of lysosomal impairment, which can cause disease, on
RPE cellular function or heterogeneity has not been considered. This proposal is a departure from the norm
because it proposes that RPE heterogeneity including a subset of cells with EMT in early AMD is initiated by
heterogeneity of lysosomal clearance defects. RPE in EMT are resistant to death, and thus, could drive AMD
pathobiology for an extended period. On the other hand, since EMT can be reversed, RPE in EMT are a
compelling treatment target because its vision preserving functions can be restored. Lysosomal function and
autophagy are modulated by the master regulator transcription factor EB (TFEB). Our laboratory has
demonstrated reduced nuclear TFEB staining in the RPE of early AMD globes compared to age-matched
controls, thus identifying TFEB as a potential therapeutic target for AMD. Given the possibility that heterogeneity
of lysosomal dysfunction drives RPE heterogeneity, from EMT to degeneration, the objective of this proposal is
to determine the impact of restoring lysosomal function and autophagy on the AMD-associated RPE
heterogeneity in our validated Cryba1 cKO rodent model of lysosomal impairment that develops a dry AMD-like
phenotype, and in human-iPSC derived RPE cells. The central hypothesis of “rejuvenating lysosomal and
autophagic function by activating TFEB will maintain RPE cell function and prevent pathologic RPE heterogeneity
including EMT, in early AMD” will be addressed with the following aims: Aim 1: Test the extent that TFEB
activation rejuvenates lysosomal/autophagy function, and modulates RPE heterogeneity and RPE cell health.
Aim 2: Test the degree that TFEB activation in the RPE of Cryba1 cKO mice rescues its AMD-like phenotype.
Aim 3: Test the degree that lysosomal heterogeneity leads to RPE heterogeneity in AMD. Successful completion
of this proposal will establish the novel concept of lysosome/autophagy dysfunction as a key driver of RPE
heterogeneity in early AMD and identify TFEB as a novel therapeutic agent."
10864957,"We normally think of the neural retina as the only light-responsive tissue of mammals. Recently,
however, it has been shown that the atypical opsins Opsin 3 (OPN3, encephalopsin) and Opsin
5 (OPN5, neuropsin) are expressed in other tissues. Investigating this further, the Lang lab has
shown that OPN5 mediates light reception in skin and brain and that OPN3 does so in adipose
tissue. In all cases, these opsins mediate direct, acute light responsiveness of the non-retinal
tissue. Here we identify the ocular lens as an intrinsically light sensitive tissue. Lenses
isolated in culture show an acute response to blue (470 nm) light that changes their optical
properties. According to preliminary data, OPN3 is required for the intrinsic light response of the
lens and we further show that light stimulation of the lens suppresses the phosphorylation of the
water channel Aquaporin 0, a substrate of protein kinase A. Since Aquaporin 0 regulates lens
transparency, we hypothesize that an OPN3-dependent, intrinsic light response regulates
aquaporin activity via the cAMP-PKA pathway and thus the optical performance of the lens.
This hypothesis implies that the lens has distinct optical states adapted to daytime and
nighttime vision. Seeking a deeper understanding of this unique lens biology, we propose three
aims, (Aim 1), To determine which G-protein OPN3 uses for signaling in the lens, (Aim 2), To
confirm the OPN3 signaling mechanism, and the influence of that signaling on aquaporins and
lens transparency including cataractogenesis, and (Aim 3), To assess the influence of lens OPN3
on lens refractive power and eye refractive development. This application builds on a long history
of interest in the ocular lens from the Lang lab and combines expertise in lens cell biology from
Steve Bassnett and eye refractive development from Rafael Grytz and Machelle Pardue.
Identification of a direct, light- and opsin-dependent optical change in the ocular lens is
unexpected and so when complete, this work will fundamentally change the way we think
of the eye as a light sensing organ. There is also the possibility that this work will identify
the lens as a new target for myopia treatment."
10898556,"WNK-SPAK kinases are integral components of a potassium-dependent signaling system, coined the “potassium
switch,” that adjusts the activity of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) in the distal
convoluted tubule (DCT) and shapes the structure of the entire distal nephron to maintain sodium and potassium
balance over a wide range of dietary potassium intakes. Low potassium consumption, common in modern diets,
presses the pathway to conserve potassium at the expense of increasing sodium absorption and increasing blood
pressure. A decrease in plasma K+, leads to a decrease in intracellular Cl- which stimulates the WNK/SPAK
pathway, leading to activation of NCC and hypertrophy/hyperplasia of the DCT. The molecular details of the
signaling pathway are still mostly unknown or are controversial, especially the specific role of a kidney-specific
isoform of WNK1 and Cab39 (MO25), a kinase adaptor protein. How Na+ transport signals to increase DCT mass
remains another great mystery. Here, we tackle these pressing unknowns, challenging prevailing views, and
pushing the boundaries of the field with an innovative, stepwise multidisciplinary approach, combining molecular
genetics, genomics, cellular biology, imaging, state-of-the-art physiological phenotyping in novel mouse models,
and, mechanistically in innovative in vitro systems Aim 1: Newly published and preliminary data challenges the
view that KS-WNK1 is an inhibitor of WNK4 and suggests that it acts to enhance WNK4-SPAK signaling in the
DCT. We test this idea by specifically targeting KS-WNK1 gene knockout in the DCT and performing a molecule-
to-physiology phenotyping analysis; characterize the KS-WNK1 transcript and protein, which our preliminary data
indicate are different than previously believed; and define mechanistically how KS-WNK1 modulates NCC
function. Aim 2: Recent data, including our preliminary data, indicate that kinase adaptor proteins, Cab39/Cab39l,
enhance WNK-SPAK signaling in the DCT. Here, we have engineered a new mouse model, overcoming a
roadblock in the field, to test this idea in a mammalian system for the first time, and have developed a new system
to understand mechanistically how the adaptor proteins interact with WNK4 and SPAK, and modulate their
function. Aim 3: Our RNAseq analysis on our DCT-specific constitutively active SPAK mouse, which is sufficient
to activate DCT hypertrophy and hyperplasia, identified a network of DCT-specific transcription factors. We
hypothesize that one of these Spalt like transcription factor-3 (Sall3) is the master regulator of the transcription
network that defines the epigenetic fingerprint of the DCT and maintains the DCT lineage as it expands. To test
this novel idea, we will define how Sall3 is induced in response to activation of SPAK and/or NCC; establish the
impact of specifically targeting Sall3 knockout in the DCT on the remodeling response using a innovative new
imaging approach; and determine if Sall3 represses gene methylation of DCT-specific gene networks. Together,
we expect these studies to have a major impact and push the field forward."
10824380,"Abstract:
Flaviviruses are primarily insect-borne, associated with global morbidity and mortality, and found on every
inhabited continent. Unfortunately, current therapeutic options for treating diseases associated with these viruses
are limited. All flaviviruses encode methyltransferases (MTases)—flaviviral NS5 for both N-7 and 2'-O
methylations of viral genomic RNA. The N-7 MTase function is essential for replication of the viral RNA genome,
whereas 2'-O MTase function is required for the virus to evade the host innate immune response. These activities
are conserved among the flaviviruses. For this project, our collaborative team will optimize the current lead
compounds, perform high throughput screening (HTS) to identify additional lead candidates, chemically optimize
the lead candidates, and define structure activity relationships. Optimizing current lead compounds using cutting-
edge medicinal chemistry, the team will perform a large scale HTS campaign using innovative fluorescence
chemical probes to identify additional small molecule inhibitors of flavivirus RNA capping MTases. We will
perform an in-depth investigation of the model of action and antiviral efficacy using in vitro biochemistry, structural
biology, virology, in vivo pharmacokinetics, and in vivo animal models, which will allow the development of novel,
effective, broad-spectrum, and druglike therapeutic agents against both flaviviruses. Preliminary progress has
been made in the identification of initial lead inhibitors of these MTases, demonstrating low nanomolar antiviral
activity. We will advance these compounds to further develop potent antiviral compounds while conducting large-
scale screening in parallel for additional structural scaffold discoveries. Complementary expertise among our
investigators will synergize and expedite the progress of this research. Our collaborative objective is to provide
first-in-class drug candidates for the treatment or prevention of these viral infections."
10847436,"Project Summary
Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that sense microbial infections and respond by inducing a caspase-
1-mediated form of inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis. Inflammasomes have been implicated in the
detection and clearance of a variety of bacterial pathogens, but little is known about whether there is active
cross-talk between the host sensing mechanism and the expression of stimulatory ligands by the pathogen. We
have found that inflammasome activation regulates expression of the NLRC4 ligand, flagellin, by Salmonella. A
host lipid stimulus released upon NLRC4-mediated macrophage pyroptosis increases expression of flagellin by
extracellular bacteria that enhances pyroptosis upon internalization, establishing a positive feedback loop that
potentiates Salmonella detection and clearance. As infection progresses, a natural type I interferon-dependent
host negative feedback response shuts down expression of NLRC4 and the lysophospholipid biosynthetic
enzyme iPLA2 to sub-baseline levels, switching Salmonella to a flagellin-low phenotype inside macrophages.
Based on these findings we hypothesize that Salmonella has evolved to co-opt NLRC4 activation and lipid
production to initially enhance production of extracellular flagellin that promotes systemic spread of the pathogen
at the risk of NLRC4-mediated clearance, and later on take advantage of decreased NLRC4 and lipid production
(a host strategy likely aimed at limiting excessive NLRC4-mediated immunopathology) to downregulate flagellin
intracellularly within macrophages. In this proposal we will investigate the host cell-intrinsic innate regulatory
circuit involving type I IFN signaling, NLRC4 and iPLA2 activity that regulates the temporal switch of Salmonella
from a flagellin-high to a flagellin-low phenotype inside macrophages. We will conduct these investigations in the
following specific aims: 1) To identify how macrophage pyroptosis promotes early increase in flagellin production
by extracellular Salmonella; 2) To dissect the natural type I interferon-dependent host negative feedback
response that establishes a NLRC4-low and iPLA2-low intracellular environment prompting Salmonella to switch
to a flagellin-low phenotype inside macrophages. Our investigations will identify the temporal and biphasic
regulation of a pathogen-derived inflammasome ligand by the very process of inflammasome activation as a
novel mode of host-pathogen cross-talk and reveal a host mechanism that Salmonella takes advantage of for
flagellin downregulation and immune escape within macrophages. These studies will also have broader
implications for understanding how host innate immunity contributes to modulation of microbial effectors
impacting the development and resolution of infections."
10820643,"ABSTRACT
Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States, though many of them pay a heavy price for
their survivorship status due to long-term side effects from cancer therapies. Radiation cystitis (RC) results
from radiation therapy for pelvic cancers. RC is a debilitating and progressive bladder condition with no
effective therapy that may be life-threatening. Thus, the treatment that killed the cancer, may ultimately kill
the cancer survivor as well. Research in cancer survivorship is highly significant and represent a great
unmet need. This grant proposal is greatly innovative and results from our studies may lead to new
diagnosis and treatment for radiation cystitis.
The PI, Bernadette Zwaans, PhD, completed a successful and productive NIDDK K01 training award. The
KO1 was focused on a systematic research on better understanding of radiation cystitis using SARRP at
the capable and resourceful environment at Beaumont Research Institute. We developed an RC
preclinical model that closely mimics the human condition. In this model, we identified that RC is a biphasic
condition, characterized by urothelial damage in the weeks after radiation therapy (=acute RC), and by
chronic fibrosis, vascular damage, and loss of detrusor muscle in months to years after radiation therapy (=
chronic RC). We have identified Amphiregulin (AREG) to be significantly elevated after radiation therapy,
and to continue to grow in abundance over time. AREG is a member of the epidermal growth factor family
that binds the EGF receptor. It has been implicated in many processes including tissue regeneration,
cancer, tissue fibrosis, and cellular senescence. AREG is present throughout the body but is most
prominently expressed in the bladder urothelium. We hypothesize that AREG mediates radiation-induced
bladder fibrosis and can serve as a potential therapeutic target. We further hypothesize that AREG
can serve as a predictive urine biomarker to identify patients that are at risk for developing chronic
RC.
Our hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: 1. Determine the expression pattern of AREG
and its importance in maintaining urothelial integrity in normal and irradiated bladder; 2. Determine the role
of AREG in mediating radiation-induced fibrosis; 3. Assess AREG as a predictive biomarker for RC. Given
our experience with RC preclinical models our team is well-suited to successfully complete these aims.
This study is investigating the first potential therapeutic target for RC and its use as a predictive urine
biomarker. The outcomes of our studies can significantly improve the quality of life of many cancer
survivors suffering from severe bladder complications due to radiation therapy. Thus, this study falls within
the mission statement of the NIDDK to improve health and quality of life of cancer survivors."
10849801,"Understanding the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is
crucial for preventing treatment resistance and tumor progression and for devising therapies that
may prolong the lives of the 200-400 pediatric DIPG patients diagnosed each year. Radiotherapy
remains the standard of care, but tumors recur in 100% of patients, resulting in dismal patient
survival of 8-11 months. Over 250 clinical trials have failed to move these numbers. Mechanistic
research is urgently needed to understand the underlying biology of CSCs and how they drive
treatment resistance to develop innovative combinatorial therapies that can change the natural
history of DIPG. Extensive preliminary data and existing literature, support the overarching
hypothesis that aldehyde hydrogenase positive (ALDH+) CSC cause therapeutic resistance and
drive tumor progression. We propose, in mechanistic studies, to characterize an epigenetically
regulated stemness program and stem cell niche (Aim 1 and 2) as potential targets (Aim 3) in
pediatric DIPG. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine the role and regulation of ALDH-positive
CSCs in DIPG. We will evaluate the regulation of specific ALDH isoforms, particularly ALDH1A3
and ALDH2 by H3 K27M mutation, and by IL1β secreted by microglia, respectively, in carefully
designed in vitro and in vivo assays using isogenic DIPG models. We will define the role of specific
ALDH isoforms, including ALDH1A3 and ALDH2, in cell differentiation, tumor initiation and
progression, and immunity. In Aim 2 we will evaluate whether ALDH+ CSCs are the cause of
therapeutic resistance and responsible for tumor progression. We will modulate expression of
disease relevant ALDH isoforms and evaluate whether therapeutic sensitivity can be restored.
We will characterize the therapy induced stem cell niche and mechanisms of immune evasion
with cutting-edge technologies, including single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and CyTOF.
In Aim 3, we will target ALDH+ CSCs as the cause of resistance to prevent tumor progression.
In preclinical proof-of concept studies we will target ALDH (Disulfiram) and PI3K/mTOR (GDC-
0084), a cell intrinsic signaling of ALDH+ CSC, to enhance outcomes from standard of care
(radiotherapy) and to prevent progression. Therefore, our studies will (1) confirm that CSCs
present a mechanism of resistance and (2) provide a rationale to target these cells specifically
and (3) address an unmet clinical need for efficacious therapies.
In summary, our proposal will mechanistically address the role of ALDH+ CSCs in
therapeutic resistance and tumor relapse of DIPG and provide druggable targets, which
can accelerate clinical translation against this devastating pediatric disease."
10877883,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Food insecurity is highly prevalent in the U.S., affecting 11.1% of households. This high prevalence is significant
because food insecurity is associated with metabolic consequences such as obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS),
and chronic diseases such as diabetes. One solution for relieving the health burden of food insecurity is to target
those most at risk for its poor outcomes. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to use a multidisciplinary,
multimethod approach to identify such individuals. The central hypothesis of this project is that those with food
insecurity and high levels of the stress hormone cortisol are most at risk for the negative behavioral and health
consequences of food insecurity. This hypothesis is based on literature and preliminary data showing that (a)
food insecurity can be stressful for many; (b) cortisol is a causal driver of high-fat, -sodium, -sugar, and -
carbohydrate (“hyperpalatable”) food consumption and (b) cortisol is associated with poor metabolic outcomes
like diabetes and MetS. Further, preliminary data for this project show that cortisol modulates the relationship
between experimentally manipulated stressful states and consumption of hyperpalatable foods. Two patterns of
cortisol levels can potentially index higher risk: (1) chronically high levels of cortisol and/or (2) high cortisol
reactivity to acute in-the-moment stressors. This project examines both by pursuing the following specific aims:
AIM 1. Determine the modulating effect of chronic high cortisol levels on associations between food insecurity
and (a) hyperpalatable food intake and (b) MetS—Recently collected data from the study team’s NHLBI Growth
and Health Study (N = 624; R01 HD073568 ) will test the hypothesis that those with higher chronic cortisol levels
indexed in hair will show a stronger relationship between food insecurity with hyperpalatable food intake and
MetS, respectively. AIM 2. Determine the modulating effect of experimentally manipulated high cortisol reactivity
on the association between food insecurity and objectively measured hyperpalatable food intake—In a laboratory
paradigm using within-subjects design, 400 individuals with food insecurity will be exposed to a gold-standard
laboratory stressor to measure cortisol reactivity compared to a no-stress session. The hypothesis tested will be
that those with greater cortisol reactivity to stress (vs. control) will engage in greater hyperpalatable food intake,
measured objectively. In an EXPLORATORY AIM, the project will examine potential roles of perceived stress
and psychosocial resilience factors. By successfully achieving these aims and demonstrating the strong
biobehavioral drivers of unhealthy diet, federal food programs (updated every 5 years) will have stronger
rationale to prioritize nutritious foods over hyperpalatable ones. With screening for food insecurity becoming
commonplace in clinical settings, additional resources for stress screening and management could be
disseminated. Discovering factors that confer resilience in the face of food insecurity will allow future work testing
them as intervention targets. This project, therefore, could ultimately reduce the consequences of food insecurity
and improve the nation’s health."
10762998,"The COVID-19 Pandemic, which became widespread in the United States in March 2020, has directly
impacted nearly everyone in our country. An exceptionally large number of Americans have contracted the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. The long-term effects of being infected by the virus are unknown, but it is evident that
many of those who contracted the virus are continuing to exhibit severe cognitive and psychological impacts
months after becoming infected. While the pandemic has affected everyone in some way, it may have
disproportionately impacted those who are the most vulnerable of our population, including those who are
homeless. Homelessness in Veterans is a major national issue, and the pandemic has only heightened the
need to address the issue. Many homeless Veterans either lived in unsheltered environments or in congregate
settings that may have limited their ability to socially distance, putting them at increased risk for infection.
Furthermore, those who have recently obtained housing often face a disruption in their daily routines and social
and family networks, which may have been exacerbated by the pandemic. This, in turn, could have further
reduced social integration and resulted in increased mental health burden. Critical knowledge gaps exist in that
we do not know how long negative cognitive and mental health outcomes from infection last, how pervasive
they are in those who have been infected, or how infection affects vulnerable Veterans (for this proposal,
Veterans with a history of chronic homelessness).
This research proposal will address these crucial knowledge gaps by examining the effects of infection on
cognitive functioning, mental health, and social integration in recently housed Veterans vs. Veterans without a
history of chronic homelessness. In an exploratory aim, we will examine if risk and protective factors
(resilience, coping, tolerance of uncertainty) and VA service utilization buffered the negative effects of infection.
In the proposed 4-year study we will recruit a total of 400 Veterans across four large metropolitan areas (Los
Angeles, Houston, Orlando, and Seattle) using VA databases to identify those who have been infected and
have a history of chronic homelessness. There will be four groups in total, with 100 participants in each group,
consisting of those infected vs. never infected and those with or without a history of chronic homelessness. All
participants will be assessed remotely every 2 months over an 18-month period.
By identifying the impact of COVID infection on vulnerable and non-vulnerable Veterans, this study can provide
valuable information not available in any VA database or other study. The VA must plan for and provide
effective treatment strategies to combat long-term effects of infection as the pandemic moves into the endemic
phase. The results from this study will help guide interventions and treatments that ultimately are aimed at
improving community integration in vulnerable Veterans and Veterans who may become infected with COVID-
19 in the coming years."
10840443,"The field of ASD screening is at a crossroads: the sensitivity of the most popular screening tool is only 33%-
38%1,3, and pediatricians consistently refer only about a third of children who fail a screening tool for an
evaluation4,5 - citing a lack of confidence in screening results as the primary reason for non-referral5. Within this
context, it is not entirely surprising that the mean age of ASD diagnosis and eventual treatment remains at ~52
months6 - years beyond the disorder’s prenatal origins7, and beyond the age when it can be reliably diagnosed
in many cases8. Clearly, new approaches need to be tested. Eye-tracking, which generates biologically-relevant,
objective, and quantifiable metrics of social and non-social visual attention patterns, is a technology that holds
considerable promise as a tool to dramatically change how screening is implemented. With the help of NIH
funding, we developed 6 novel eye tracking tests that tap into key challenge areas for children with ASD including
visual social attention, gaze shifting, and auditory social attention. Leveraging our large legacy eye tracking
dataset collected from >2,000 toddlers spanning multiple diagnostic groups including ASD, non-ASD delay, and
TD we determined optimal eye tracking metrics and cut-off values across for each test that result in very high
specificity and PPV (~97% & ~90%) but modest sensitivity (~20% per test). Combining across all 6-tests
however, dramatically improves sensitivity (~90%) and results in high classification accuracy (AUC .95). These
findings, however, were demonstrated in a laboratory setting with utility in real-world clinical settings unknown.
Thus, in AIM 1, we take the bold step of testing whether eye-tracking administered across 8,000 12, 18, & 24
month well-baby check-ups (from ~5,2000 unique toddlers) serving families from a wide range of racial, ethnic,
and SES backrounds can improve ASD early screening when implemented by medical staff in pediatric offices.
Toddlers who fail eye-tracking using resarcher defined criteria, and a percentage who pass, will be evaluated by
a licensed psychologist blind to eye tracking scores, and diagnostic classification accuracy of eye-tracking
computed. Relationships between eye tracking profiles and clinical phenotype will also be examined. In order to
fully understand the accuracy of eye tracking as a screening tool, diagnostic outcomes of the entire screened
cohort needs to be determined. Thus, in AIM 2 electronic health records (EHRs) will be leveraged to allow us to
not only determine the true sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of eye tracking for detecting ASD, but to also
compare results to rates of ASD detection using the CSBS, a parent report screening tool used as standard of
care in San Diego as part of our Get SET Early model9. State of-the-art bioinformatics will allow us to further
determine if combining eye-tracking with parent report is superior relative to either approach alone. Statistical
modeling will reveal whether or not factors such as age at screening, sex, race, ethnicity or SES impacts eye
tracking scores. Finally in AIM 3, pediatricians and parents will rate their satisfaction with eye tracking."
10838487,"Project Summary
Over 40% of pregnancies fail in women, most before or during embryo implantation. During this time, embryos
are dependent on secretions into the uterine lumen that contains all of the growth factors and nutrients
necessary for embryo development. In particular, embryos need glucose. From fertilization until the morula
stage, glucose uptake is low, but without glucose, the embryo degenerates. As embryos approach the
blastocyst stage, glucose uptake increases dramatically, providing ATP to the embryo within the hypoxic
uterine lumen. The endometrial stroma also uses a large amount of glucose to decidualize. After
decidualization, the stroma relies on Warburg metabolism to produce ATP and supplies glucose to the invading
embryo. Thus, it is clear that glucose availability must be regulated in a spatiotemporal manner to ensure a
successful pregnancy. Finally, obesity leads to reduced fertility in women through, in part, effects on the uterus
and its ability to support pregnancy. Most research on endometrial glucose has focused on the role of glucose
transporters. However, the endometrium can also transiently store glucose as the macromolecule glycogen. In
women, endometrial glycogen concentrations are correlated with fertility, but a direct link between uterine
glycogen and fertility has never been established. To investigate this in mice, we collected uteri on proestrus
and days post coitum (DPC) 1.5, 3.5, and 5.5. Our preliminary data show that the mouse endometrium stores
two distinct glycogen pools: in the uterine epithelium and the uterine decidua. Epithelial glycogen peaked at
proestrus and significantly reduced during the preimplantation period. The epithelial expressed glycogen
phosphorylase and glucose-6-phosphatase, suggesting the epithelium can catabolize glycogen and secrete
the resulting glucose. In contrast, the endometrial stroma stored little glycogen until decidualization, when
glycogen content increased 7-fold. Similarly, artificially induced decidualization in hormonally primed mice
resulted in a 5-fold increase in glycogen levels. In order to establish a definitive relationship between these
distinct pools of glycogen and fertility, we obtained glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) floxed mice so that we can
knockout GYS1 in a tissue-specific manner. Aim 1 will generate an LTFiCre/+ GYS1flox/flox mouse to study the role
of epithelial glycogen in glucose secretion and preimplantation embryo survival. Aim 2 will use AMHR2Cre/+
GYS1flox/flox mice to study the role of glycogen in the decidua. Collectively these aims will establish a causative
link between the ability of the uterus to store glycogen in the epithelium and decidua and fertility. Aim 3 will use
a diet-induced obesity model to study how maternal obesity affects glycogen metabolism in the mouse uterus.
We will determine how a 45% and 60% fat diet affects uterine metabolism and fertility in a C57BL/6 mouse
model. In vitro, we will determine the effects of hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia on decidual glycogen. In
summary, this research will evaluate the role of endometrial glycogen stores in support of early pregnancy and
assess the potential for maternal obesity to result in dysfunctional endometrial glycogen metabolism."
10800698,"Project Summary
Critical technological challenges have significantly restricted the applicability of polymer-based drug delivery
systems (DDSs). Aliphatic polyesters, such as polylactide (PLA) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB), are
biodegradable and biocompatible, but their hydrophobicity and lack of functionalities limit their biomedical
applications. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) has been broadly used in DDSs, but can cause undesired
immunogenicity. Zwitterionic polymers (ZPs) have emerged as promising alternatives of PEGs, but typical ZPs
are non-biodegradable and may possibly result in severe in vivo side effects. Combination therapy has great
clinical potentials; however, the lack of appropriate DDSs limits its applicability. Cyclic polymers have shown
novel biointerface properties, but in-depth studies are needed to gain insights into their in vitro and in vivo
behaviors. To address these challenges, we design multifunctional biodegradable zwitterionic polymer-drug
conjugates (ZPDCs; with both open-chain and cyclic structures) as novel PEG-free DDSs. It is hypothesized that
such ZPDCs can possess a broad range of favorable biomedically relevant properties for effective multidrug
co-delivery. To examine the hypothesis, we propose to systematically investigate ZPDCs with three specific
aims: 1) to synthesize multifunctional biodegradable multidrug-containing ZPDCs, 2) to understand their
structure-dependent interactions with biochemical environments & cells, and 3) to understand their
structure-dependent in vivo behaviors. We will synthesize a library of well-defined ZPDCs with PLA or
P3HB-based backbones that carry sulfobetaine-based zwitterions, paclitaxel and gemcitabine as multidrug as
combination therapy for pancreatic cancer, cyanine5.5 as imaging dye, and plectin-1 targeted peptide as
targeting ligand. These ZPDCs will be prepared through living ring-opening polymerization of
alkene/alkyne-functionalized cyclic esters, followed by alkyne-azide and thiol-ene dual Click functionalization.
Comprehensive analytical approaches will be employed to characterize the ZPDCs to verify their well-controlled
structures. To achieve insightful understanding on their structure-dependent biointerface properties, systematic
biochemical, cellular and in vivo studies of ZPDCs will be performed. Research activities will include
anti-biofouling analysis, drug release study, degradation assessment, cytotoxicity assay, evaluation of cellular
uptake efficiency and mechanisms, the determination of blood circulation time, the measurements of
pharmacokinetics and biodistribution, the examination of immune responses, and the evaluation of therapeutic
efficacy in vivo. Together, the proposed R01 studies will establish the synthetic method for ZPDCs, provide key
insights into their structure-dependent biointerface properties, and elucidate their design rules. These studies will
lay a solid foundation for the development of ZPDCs as a new, PEG-free platform technology. The in-depth
comparative studies of cyclic and open-chain ZPDCs will provide critical guideline on topological design of
polymeric biomaterials. The outcomes of this project potentially may also benefit patients with pancreatic cancer."

This project will leverage emerging knowledge about the role of immunometabolism in the pathophysiology of
depression in people with HIV to generate hypotheses about potential future treatments. Depression in PWH
is characterized by features that differentiate it from depression in people without HIV (PWoH). The first is the
predominance of anhedonia - inability to gain enjoyment from activities. The second is a higher prevalence of
depression that is resistant to treatment with standard antidepressant drugs in PWH versus PWoH. These
clinical observations suggest not only that the underlying pathophysiology of depression is different between
the two populations, but that different treatments are needed to successfully treat depression in PWH.
Molecular studies of immunometabolism, defined as reciprocal interactions between immunity and metabolism
that are dysregulated and linked to depression in PWH, support these distinctions. Based on our preliminary
data and that in the literature, we propose to perform RNA-Seq transcriptomics, relating immunometabolic
gene expression to protein and other biomarkers of immunometabolism, and to clinical depression as well as
to cognitive processes impacted by depression. Our hypothesis-driven approach will focus on two interacting,
co-regulated gene pathways central to depression and immunometabolism, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) and the NLRP3 inflammasome. We will study 80 newly recruited PWH and 40 age-
matched PWoH. Given our early work suggesting that the relationship between immunometabolism and
depression is sex-dependent, we aim for a 50/50 breakdown of men and premenopausal women in order to
examine sex differences in these relationships. To optimize the spectrum of depressive symptom severity in
our sample (e.g., avoid over-representation of individuals with minimal depressive symptoms), we will stratify
with a 50/50 breakdown above and below the previously established Beck Depression Inventory-II cut-score
for clinically-significant depressive symptoms (≥16). Since clinical studies cannot rigorously establish
mechanistic relationships, we will study in parallel the roles of mTOR and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling in
depression-like behaviors in a mouse model of HIV infection, EcoHIV, which expresses seven of nine key
human HIV proteins. These pathways will be dissected using mTOR and NLRP3 inhibitors. Also, in these
animals we will characterize immunometabolic markers in brain tissue, presumably the substrate of
depression."

 In this K23 career development award, Dr. Lawren VandeVrede, a behavioral neurologist and Assistant
Professor at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), will obtain training in the use, validation, and
translation of multimodal biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). This project
supports his long-term career goal to become a leader in ADRD biomarker translation and novel clinical trial
design, and to establish a lab that paves the way for a new generation of clinical trials that will evaluate and
refine treatment approaches for patients with dementia. Through this K23 and the enriched multidisciplinary
training environment at UCSF, Dr. VandeVrede aims to accomplish the following specific training goals: 1) gain
expertise in the use of clinical, neuropathological, biofluid, and neuroimaging biomarker modalities, 2) develop
specialized proficiency in validation of novel plasma AD biomarkers benchmarked to gold-standard
neuropathology and current-generation positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging, and (3) develop a
pathway for translation of biomarkers into clinical settings for use as large-scale screening and diagnostic tools
for ADRD. To achieve these goals, Dr. VandeVrede has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including
his primary mentor, Dr. Adam Boxer, a leader in ADRD fluid biomarker discovery and clinical trial design, and
co-mentors, Drs. Lea Grinberg and Gil Rabinovici, experts in ADRD neuropathology and PET imaging
respectively. In addition, he has two collaborators with expertise in relevant plasma biomarker assays, Drs.
Michelle Mielke and Jeff Dage, and a biostatistician, Dr. John Kornak, with significant expertise in ADRD
biomarker validation and clinical trial design.
 The overarching goal of the project is to better characterize the diagnostic performance of several novel AD
plasma biomarkers in an important and clinically relevant patient population: mixed etiology dementia. The
central rationale is that blood tests are critically needed for large-scale diagnostic screening for AD, and
whereas several proposed plasma biomarkers in the research world show promise as future clinical tools, key
validation data and comparisons between biomarkers are missing in real-world dementia patients with mixed
etiology. Therefore, in this project, novel plasma biomarkers of ADRD will be validated (1) in Aim I against
gold-standard neuropathology in autopsy cohorts that include comorbid and alternative neuropathologies; (2) in
Aim II against current-generation PET biomarkers in several prospective observational studies that include
early, mixed, and atypical clinical phenotypes; and (3) in Aim III in a large community-based study specifically
designed to recruit under-represented minorities. This project provides critical data that would support
translation of these specific blood tests into clinical use, and establishes a platform for future discovery and
validation projects for ADRD biomarkers."

Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (ATAAD), either associated with genetic conditions or
spontaneous as sporadic ATAAD, are extremely lethal diseases that often present as surgical emergencies.
Unfortunately, no clinically proven medication is available to prevent sporadic ATAAD progression. There is a
critical need to develop effective pharmacological strategies to treat ATAAD. The hallmark of sporadic ATAAD
is progressive aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) depletion and extracellular matrix (ECM) destruction leading to
aortic dilatation, dissection, and ultimately rupture. Our long-term goal is to improve our understanding of the
molecular pathogenesis of sporadic ATAAD in hope of developing new pharmacological strategies to prevent
disease progression. Our preliminary studies suggest that damaged DNA in SMCs activates a pore-forming
protein, gasdermin D (GSDMD), that drives SMC pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death
that may represent a common pathway to aortic SMC loss. Therefore, the objectives of this application are to
determine the role and mechanisms of GSDMD-mediated SMC pyroptosis in ATAAD development and to ex-
amine the extent to which cytosolic DNA sensing and pyroptosis represent therapeutic targets against ATAAD.
Our central hypothesis is that sensor pathways triggered by damaged DNA activate GSDMD-mediated SMC
pyroptosis, leading to aortic degeneration, dissection, and rupture. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of
GSDMD-mediated SMC pyroptosis in ATAAD formation. We will test the hypothesis that GSDMD-mediated
SMC pyroptosis is critically involved in aortic degeneration, biomechanical failure, and ATAAD development by
examining these aspects in Gsdmd-/-mice and inducible SMC-specific Gsdmd knockout mice in our established
sporadic ATAAD model. In Aim 2, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying the activation of GSDMD-
mediated SMC pyroptosis. In a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, we will test the hypothesis that cyto-
solic DNA-triggered cGAS-STING sensor signaling, through TBK1/IKK2/DNA-PK kinases, directly phosphory-
lates GSDMD and promotes its activation and pore formation in plasma membranes, leading to mitochondrial
damage and ultimately pyroptotic SMC death. In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which suppressing cy-
tosolic DNA sensing and pyroptotic cell death will prevent ATAAD development and progression. We will test
the hypothesis that simultaneously blocking the cGAS-STING pathway and pyroptosis will prevent aortic de-
struction and disease progression in our sporadic ATAAD model. We expect that this work will determine how
damaged DNA induces pyroptosis and thereby compromises the structure and function of the ascending aortic
wall. The positive impact of this work will be an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms that
cause SMC pyroptosis in the development of aortic degeneration, providing an exciting new direction for treat-
ment strategies for preventing ATAAD formation and its fatal sequelae. The novel mechanisms regarding DNA
damage-induced pyroptotic cell death will also have broad implications in many other cardiovascular diseases.

 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes lifelong infection in 95% of adults worldwide. EBV
causes infectious mononucleosis, lymphomas, nasopharyngeal and gastric cancer, and oral
hairy leukoplakia. EBV is transmitted between hosts through saliva, from which it translocates
across the oral cavity and tonsillar epithelium to reach the B-cell compartment. Upon B-cell
infection, the ~170 kilobase linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) EBV genome is delivered to
the nucleus. EBV then uses a series of latency programs to navigate the B-cell compartment,
and colonize the memory B-cell compartment. Ultimately, to spread between cells and to the
tonsillar epithelium for transfer to a new host, EBV must undergo lytic replication, in which
nearly 80 viral proteins are expressed and infectious virion are produced. Lytic replication is
increasingly implicated in oncogenesis. Yet, much remains to be learned about how the viral
lytic switch is controlled. We therefore used a human genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to
identify host factors that control the viral lytic switch. Our analyses a network of host factors that
repress lytic reactivation, centered on the transcription factor MYC, including cohesins, FACT,
STAGA, and Mediator. Depletion of MYC or factors important for MYC expression, reactivated
the lytic cycle, including in Burkitt xenografts. MYC bound the EBV genome origin of lytic
replication and suppressed its looping to the lytic cycle initiator BZLF1 promoter. Our central
hypothesis is that the MYC:MAX control the EBV lytic switch through regulation of viral genome
loop extrusion. Our Aims are to (1) Define key MYC roles in regulation of oriLyt loop extrusion to
control the EBV lytic switch; (2) Define MYC-gated cohesin roles in regulation of oriLyt loop
extrusion in EBV lytic switch control (3) Define MYC-gated CTCF roles in regulation of oriLyt
loop extrusion to control the EBV lytic switch. Collectively, these studies are expected to identify
how EBV subverts host DNA loop extrusion pathways to control the viral lytic switch.
Our studies may therefore support strategies to develop rational lytic induction therapeutic
therapies for EBV-associated diseases."
10775831,"Project Summary / Abstract
A long-standing question in immunology is why some naïve CD8+ T cells become effectors and die after
infection, whereas others survive to become memory cells. The current dogma suggests that a single lineage of
naïve CD8+ T cells can give rise to either effector or memory T cells depending on cues they encounter
(inflammation, antigen) in the priming environment during infection. However, we recently discovered that the
propensity for cells to adopt particular fates during infection is linked to their development origins, i.e., whether
they were derived from stem cell populations in the fetal liver or bone marrow. We found that fetal-derived CD8+
T cells are the first to respond to infection in adulthood but rapidly become short-lived effectors. In contrast, adult-
derived CD8+ T cells respond with slower kinetics but give rise to more memory CD8+ T cells. An important
question is, why are fetal-derived T cells the first to respond to infection in adult animals? Answering this question
has been a challenge because we lack critical information on how developmental origin alters CD8+ T cell
position and behavior during priming in the lymph node. To overcome this challenge, we have formed a
collaboration with the Xu lab to image the behavior of live T cells throughout the entire depth of the lymph node
during infection. Our hypothesis is that fetal-derived cells are the first to respond to infection in adulthood either
(a) because they are optimally positioned in the lymph node prior to infection, or (b) because they respond
differently to dendritic cells (DCs) in the lymph node during priming. To differentiate between these possibilities,
we will use fate-mapping ‘timestamp’ mice and high-resolution three-photon (3P) microscopy to map out the
developmental layers of CD8+ T cells in the lymph node during infection. Upon completion of these studies, we
expect to provide a new conceptual framework to explain why individual CD8+ T cells behave in distinct ways in
the lymph node and are recruited into the response with different kinetics."

10953722,"PROJECT SUMMARY: THE SEQUENCING AND MICROARRAY FACILITY (SMF)
The mission of the Sequencing and Microarray Facility (SMF) is to use state-of-the-art instrumentation and
innovative technical expertise to provide investigators with the highest quality genomic data from a
comprehensive range of genomic services, which include Illumina platform-based next-generation sequencing
(NGS) services (whole genome, whole exome, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and single-cell analysis), Sanger- and
Illumina-based gene resequencing, and microarray platforms (gene expression, microRNA, methylation, single-
nucleotide polymorphism, and copy number analyses). For these services, the SMF innovates and develops
customized protocols, as needed, to enable investigators to obtain reliable genomic data on specimens that are
commonly found in cancer center tissue banks such as FFPE tissues, serum, plasma, and urine, the analytes
from which are often of low quality and/or quantity. Demand for SMF's NGS service has increased 1374% over
the prior grant cycle.
The SMF director is Dr. Vicki Huff, co-directors are Drs. Sharon Dent and Nicholas Navin, and the Facility
Manager is Ms. Erika Thompson. Instrumentation includes two NovaSeqs, a HighSeq4000, two HiSeq2000s,
a NextSeq500, a MiSeq, two ABI 3730s, a digital droplet PCR System, a Fluidigm C1 Single-Cell Auto Prep and
EVOS FL Auto Imaging Systems, a Nanostring nCounter MAX Analysis System, a 10X Genomics Chromium
System, an Affymetrix Fluidics Station, and two robotic workstations (Agilent Bravo and Eppendorf epMotion
5075 TMX). Many of these were purchased using the $3,171,019 the institution has provided the SMF for
equipment since 2013. One of the NovaSeq6000s was purchased with an NIH S10 HEI grant award.
The SMF supported the research of 482 MD Anderson investigators, 361 of whom are CCSG program members
representing all 16 CCSG programs. In the past grant cycle, SMF contributed to 649 publications, 78% of which
were published in journals with IF >5 and 29% of which were published in journals with IF >10. Chargeback fees
provided 93% of the SMF budget of $7,138,252. CCSG support was 6.8% ($486,766). Because 93% of the
samples processed by the SMF were from peer-reviewed users, CCSG funds were well leveraged. In grant Yr44,
the SMF is requesting $497,812 from the CCSG (estimated 6.6% of its budget).
In the coming grant cycle, the SMF will continue to build on its record of providing cutting-edge genomic services
to support high-impact science. Current plans include 1) continuing the development of specialized protocols
and services, including immune profiling, single-cell copy number analysis, single-cell ATAC-Seq, and single-
cell CRISPR sequencing, as well as phased exomes and whole genomes, accurate large structural variant
identification, and digital spatial profiling, and 2) expanding SMF services to include enhanced data processing.
With these measures, we will continue to provide investigators with the unique and exceptional genomic services
they have come to expect from the SMF."

that affect the environment, animal health, model fidelity, and data integrity. Aim 2: To provide expert
consultation and collaboration in areas including animal husbandry, veterinary care, surgical and imaging
techniques, and rodent colony management. Aim 3: To provide specialized services such as rodent-specific
genetic characterization and research histology for both live animals and cell lines, to develop new surgical
techniques and imaging procedures, and to collaborate on the design of animal studies for therapeutic
discovery and preclinical drug development."
10953726,"PROJECT SUMMARY: GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MOUSE FACILITY (GEMF) 
The MD Anderson Genetically Engineered Mouse Facility (GEMF) provides a wide range of mouse genetic 
engineering services to investigators at a reasonable cost. Compensated services provided include transgenic 
mouse generation (using pronuclear and blastocyst injection), gene targeting (using CRISPR/Cas9, 
transposon-mediated transgenesis, the electroporation of embryonic stem [ES] cells, and TARGATT@ 
protocols), archiving of mouse embryos and sperm, generation of ES cells from investigators' own mouse 
lines, and rederivation of mouse lines. In addition, consultation for assessing how genetically engineered 
animals can contribute to PIs' projects and grant support are provided at no cost. A service unique to the 
GEMF is the inclusion of a Mouse Resource Facility to provide reagents (e.g., superovulation hormones, ES 
cell media), DNA plasmids (required for generating DNA constructs for gene targeting and pronuclear 
injection), and Cre, LacZ, GFP, and p53 transgenic mice (commonly used for the detection and/or generation 
of conditional mutations in mice and for probing tumor phenotypes). Support provided through CCSG 
Development Funds was essential for developing the new GEMF service of in vitro transcription of sgRNA. The 
facility has been in service since 1988 and was started by Dr. Guillermina Lozano, who was appointed 
director in 2013, and is currently managed by Dr. Jan Parker-Thornburg, the co-director, who is a recipient of 
an R50 award. The facility has an annual budget of $775,887 (74% for costs for highly expert personnel), 
$342,039 (44%) of which is supported with CCSG funding. During the present grant period, the institution 
invested $292,586 in funding for capital equipment, including replacement microscopes, automated injection 
systems, and a multi-functional electroporation system that can be used both for ES cells and for 
CRISPR/Cas9 embryo electroporation. Services provided have been fairly evenly distributed among 
investigators at MD Anderson; 155 cancer center members representing all 16 CCSG programs have used 
GEMF services over the past 6 years. In grant Yr42, peer-reviewed funding–supported usage accounted for 
95% of all usage, and CCSG funds are requested to cover 41% of total expenses in Yr44 ($316,563). The 
animals and materials produced by the GEMF have contributed significantly to high-impact science at MD 
Anderson that has resulted in more than 201 publications, including 69 (34%) in journals with IF >10 and 146 
(73%) in journals with IF >5. The GEMF's specific aims are: Aim 1. To produce the genetically engineered 
animal models required by MD Anderson investigators for their studies in cancer research using both 
traditional and state-of-the-art techniques, based on the need of the faculty. Aim 2. To provide services to MD 
Anderson investigators to derive and archive mouse models. Aim 3. To use investigator-produced mouse 
embryos for the generation of unique ES cell lines. Aim 4. To provide expertise and training in the generation, 
care, and handling of GEM models."

combined research training and career development at UCLA that launched careers of dentist-scientists and
oral health-scientists and prepared them for adverse challenges in science, healthcare, and society. The
application continues this long-standing tradition and aims to bolster a vigorous and diverse dental, oral and
craniofacial research workforce via a rigorous and interdisciplinary training program that offers trainees novel
and innovative research training experiences in a highly supportive institutional environment. We have
assembled an excellent team of faculty mentors who embody four areas of scientific strengths – (1) Cancer
Biology, Oral Cancer & Stem Cells, (2) Craniofacial Biology, Bioengineering & Regenerative Medicine, (3)
Microbes – Virulence Mechanisms and Advanced Imaging by CryoEM, and (4) Translational Genetics,
Epigenetics, & Genomics. Our interdisciplinary training program links trainees to mentors at the School of
Dentistry, School of Medicine, School of Engineering, Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Molecular
Biology Institute, Stem Cell Institute, and California NanoSystem Institute. The integration of these
interdepartmental centers and institutes provides a rich training environment with enormous physical resources
and centralized core facilities. We offer five training tracks, (i) Dentist-Scientist Trainee Program (dual degree
DDS/PhD), (ii) Dentist-PhD Program (predoctoral research training to dentists), (iii) Dentist-Scientists
Postdoctoral Fellow (postdoctoral training to dentists), (iv) Predoctoral PhD Trainee (predoctoral training in oral
health), and (v) Oral Health Postdoctoral Fellow (postdoctoral training in oral health). Collectively, our proposed
training program will train the next generation of dentist-scientists and oral health scientists to conduct basic,
translational, and clinical research to improve dental, oral, and craniofacial health."
10869952,"Project Abstract
Despite decades of research in the understanding and treatment of diseases of the heart and lung,
cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases remain the leading causes of hospitalization, disability, and death in the
U.S. Notably, growing numbers of patients with childhood-onset chronic illnesses, such as congenital heart
defects, cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and hemophilia, are surviving into adulthood, making it
imperative to conduct research encompassing the lifespan. Against this background of critical research needs,
there is a strikingly growing shortage of M.D.-scientists, such that the proportion of M.D.s that remain primarily
in research careers has decreased by 3-fold in the last 3 decades, despite the climbing number of total physicians
in practice. The pipeline of M.D.-scientist development is also at risk: fewer medical students express interest in
a research career, and fewer graduates apply for NIH funding. Importantly, relative to the overall physician
workforce, women and minorities are disproportionately underrepresented in the proportion of M.D.-scientists.
These challenges require the implementation of innovative recruitment and training strategies to feed the M.D.-
scientist pipeline and ensure that women and minorities are well-represented. To help fill these critical gaps, we
will establish the University of Texas Southwestern (UTSW) - Stimulating Access to Research in
Residency (UT-StARR) training program to recruit and train a diverse group of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics
residents that will become the next generation of M.D.-scientists conducting laboratory-based, translational,
clinical, and population health research to detect, treat, and prognosticate diseases affecting the heart, lungs,
and blood of diverse populations throughout the lifespan. Our institution will provide an ideal environment with a
multidisciplinary cadre of funded research; robust didactic training program; and diverse patient population. We
hypothesize that the 3 axes of diversity at UTSW - M.D. trainees, mentors, and patient community - afford the
unique opportunity to address unmet needs in M.D. research training, personalized medicine, and population
health. The following Aims organize our approach: Aim 1. To provide broad-based comprehensive mentored
research training for a group of diverse Internal Medicine and Pediatric resident-investigators in the conception,
design, and implementation of laboratory-based, translational, clinical, and population research in diseases
affecting the heart, lungs and blood, encompassing detection, prevention, treatment, and outcomes to improve
the health of individuals and populations throughout the human lifespan; Aim 2. To provide the essential research
training and mentoring platform needed to build a strong foundation allowing successful transition of residents
to independent M.D.-scientists conducting biomedical research in the heart, lung, and blood fields; Aim 3. To
enhance the participation and persistence of M.D.s from underrepresented groups in research by implementation
and maintenance of institutional mentored residency training programs involving diverse residents, mentors, and
patients through evaluation and monitoring the progress of UT-StARR and other institutional training programs."
10885083,"Nearly 400 million people are infected with dengue virus (DENV) each year through the bite of infected mosquitos
concentrated in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Symptoms can range from febrile illness to
severe dengue that manifests as plasma leakage, sudden loss of blood pressure, organ failure, and shock that
can ultimately lead to death. Severe dengue complications are often associated with a secondary heterotypic
infection of one of the four circulating serotypes. In this scenario, humoral immune responses targeting cross-
reactive, poorly-neutralizing epitopes lead to increased infectivity of susceptible cells via antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE). Additionally, DENV immunity has been implicated in increased susceptibility to Zika virus
through ADE. Currently there are no available therapeutics to combat DENV disease. Dengvaxia, the only
licensed DENV vaccine, was found to increase hospitalization rates in naïve populations, and thus is not
recommended for a large portion of at-risk individuals. There is an urgent need for a safe and efficacious vaccine
that elicits a robust, balanced, neutralizing response to all four DENV serotypes. We propose to develop a novel
DENV vaccine utilizing an emergent platform: mRNA encoding for viral proteins encapsidated in a lipid
nanoparticle (LNP). mRNA-LNP vaccines elicit robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in a safe,
non-infectious platform. Additionally, we can direct the host immune response towards neutralizing epitopes by
mutating the mRNA encoding for the viral protein. We hypothesize that a sequence-engineered tetravalent
mRNA-LNP vaccine will induce a balanced, protective immune response against all four serotypes of
dengue without the potential of causing immune enhancement and ADE. In Aim 1 of this study we will
generate and optimize mRNA constructs encoding for the pre-membrane and envelope viral glycoproteins for all
four serotypes of DENV. We will mutate the poorly-neutralizing, cross-reactive epitopes that drive ADE. In Aim
2 we will characterize the immune response to the vaccines in a mouse model. In addition to quantifying humoral
and cellular immune responses, we will also measure the immune enhancement capacity of all vaccines. In Aim
3, we will evaluate vaccine efficacy and safety in susceptible mouse models, by challenging vaccinated mice
with different DENV serotypes to monitor protection and ADE. We will also determine mechanism of protection
via adoptive transfer experiments. Through this study, we will identify DENV vaccines that demonstrate broad
protection and lack of immune enhancement for further evaluation as candidate human vaccines."
10873854,"Project Summary:
Our laboratories have focused on the most prevalent chemical modifications that we have identified to be
associated with the insoluble proteins present in the nucleus of the lens- deamidation and oxidation. These
modifications are most relevant to age-related nuclear cataract, by far the most common type of cataract. In
this proposed work, we will examine the interplay between deamidation and oxidation in order to mimic the
age-related processes in the lens. Although the lens environment is normally in a reduced state, oxidation of
sulfhydryls in crystallins has long been associated with age-related cataract as the pool of lens glutathione
diminishes with aging in the center of the lens. The formation of non-native, disulfide crosslinked crystallin
subunits via the oxidation of Cys residues is therefore anticipated to be a key process leading to the
aggregation and insolubilization of lens proteins. In Aim 1, we will determine how specific, age-related
deamidations in γS promote its aggregation by identifying non-native disulfide bond formed in response to
combined deamidation and oxidation. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that non-native disulfide bond
formation leads to higher ordered oligomers of γS. While the focus of Aims 1 and 2 is the oxidation of
deamidated γS, Aim 3 explores whether these age-related modifications in γS lead to non-native crosslinks
between γ- and β-crystallin subunits and thereby disrupt the native quaternary arrangement of the crystallins.
Overall, these findings will elucidate how deamidation, a spontaneous modification, contributes to the
oxidation-driven aggregation cascade that underlies age-related nuclear cataract. Establishing that
deamidation mediates its effects predominantly via augmenting the oxidation of crystallin proteins will provide a
robust model for the development of therapeutic strategies aiming to delay the onset of age-related nuclear
cataract by restoring the antioxidant levels of the lens. The work will also have significant implications for
several other diseases where deamidation and oxidation of long-lived proteins is associated with amyloid fibril
formation."
10866563,"The trans-golgi network (TGN) serves as intermediate target organelle of the cytoplasmic transport during HPV
infectious entry. It has previously been established that nuclear envelope breakdown is required for viral genome
to enter the nucleus. We recently found that viral genome dissociates from TGN in prophase and associates with
microtubules to accumulate at the microtubule-organizing center. At later stages of mitosis (metaphase), viral
genome moves away from the mitotic spindle poles towards chromosomes. Our data point to a switch in the
directionality of microtubule mediated transport from minus end- to plus end-directed during mitosis. Preliminary
inhibitor studies point to dynein and Kif11 as motor proteins involved in the transport. Shift in directionality and
the role of motor proteins for microtubule mediated transport will be further studied in Aim 1. Rather than
egressing from the endocytic compartment in prophase, viral genome is still found in a membrane-bound
vesicular compartment throughout mitotic transport. Viral genome egresses from membrane vesicles after
nuclear envelope reformation. These are paradigm shifting findings, which have recently been confirmed by Day
et al using electron microscopy. It is unclear, how HPV achieves egress from the nuclear transport vesicles. We
hypothesized that HPV utilizes a cellular pathway to dissolve vesicles ending up in the nucleus, whether on
purpose (e.g. viral infection) or accidentally. Indeed, preliminary data suggest that specific isoforms of
phospholipase C, whose knockdown severely impairs HPV16 infection at a stage after nuclear delivery, may be
involved in dissolving the vesicular membrane. The hypothesis will be tested in Aim 2 using knockdown and
knockout approaches combined with differential staining techniques and EM. Release from transport vesicles is
preceded by PML protein recruitment. Recruitment of another component of PML nuclear bodies (NB), Sp100,
is specifically delayed in PML NB assembling around incoming genome. In cells deficient for PML protein, viral
genome is lost and therefore transcriptionally inactive. In Aim 2, we will test our hypothesis that the recruitment
of specific PML isoforms is the underlying reason for delayed recruitment of Sp100 and that HPV-induced PML
NB reorganization is important for transcriptional regulation of the incoming genome. We have recently described
a novel cell culture model that allows efficient infection of primary keratinocytes for investigating the role of PML
NB components in a relevant cell culture model.
Overall, our proposed studies will fill a huge gap in the understanding of microtubule mediated transport during
late HPV intracellular trafficking and will help us unravel the role of PML NB during the immediate early events
of the HPV life cycle essential for establishing infection. Furthermore, the proposal has the potential to uncover
a hitherto unrecognized cellular pathway to dissolve vesicles ending up in the nucleus. Even though speculative
at this time, the observations may trigger a rethinking of possible roles of vesicular cargo delivery to the nucleus
during mitosis and its role in nucleus homeostasis."
10862592,"ABSTRACT
Despite the availability of vaccines, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) infections in the elderly
remain a health and economic burden in the USA. This calls for a better understanding of pathways driving
immune dysregulation in aged hosts, reducing vaccine efficacy and rendering this population susceptible to
infections. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the role of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the age-
driven reduction in vaccine responses and increased susceptibility to S. pneumoniae infection. Background:
A key immune cell following S. pneumoniae infection is PMN. PMNs are innate cells required for controlling
bacterial numbers and whose function is known to decline with age. Recent work shows that PMNs are
important regulators of adaptive immunity. However, the role of PMNs in clinically relevant vaccinations and
their impact in the reduced vaccine efficacy seen in aging remains completely unexplored. We found that
vaccination with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar-13, failed to protect old mice against
pneumococcal infection. Further, in young hosts, optimal protection following vaccination required PMNs both
at the time vaccine administration and at the time of pneumococcal-challenge, highlighting the role of PMNs as
both inducers and effectors of vaccine responses. This led to the Hypothesis that age-driven changes in
PMNs result in the decline of vaccine efficacy against S. pneumoniae in the elderly. Here we test this
hypothesis in both murine models and human volunteers with the following Aims: 1) Test the role of PMNs as
effectors in the decline of pneumococcal vaccine efficacy during aging. 2) Test the role of PMNs as inducers of
the age-driven decline in pneumococcal vaccine efficacy. 3) Test the effect of host aging on PMN responses
following vaccination in human donors. Significance/ innovation: Elucidating the role of PMNs in the decline
in vaccine efficacy against pneumococci in the elderly will vastly contribute to our understanding of how aging
alters innate immune responses and how innate immunity in turn regulates the decline in adaptive memory
responses. Further, understanding the role of PMNs, which are involved in host defense against multiple
pathogens, is imperative for future design of better preventative approaches against pneumococci and other
relevant infections that target the vulnerable elderly population. This proposal is perfectly in line with NIA’s
mission to promote healthy aging."
10878810,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Peripheral metabolic tissues engage in pervasive inter-organ crosstalk to maintain
systemic glucose and lipid homeostasis. This long-range intercellular communication is mediated by blood
borne, secreted polypeptides. Over the last decade, there has been renewed interest in identifying additional
proteins secreted from metabolic tissues. This is because the collection of secreted proteins (e.g., secretome)
from metabolic cell types is large and also poorly characterized, and therefore many additional polypeptides
that mediate peripheral tissue crosstalk likely remain to be discovered. It is not unreasonable to imagine that
many of these orphan factors represent new signaling pathways and consequently potentially new therapeutic
targets for obesity, diabetes, and related metabolic disorders. Typically, approaches to this problem have relied
on surrogate methods that attempt to predict, rather than directly measure, in vivo polypeptide secretion
events. In recent work, we have introduced an in vivo chemical methodology that enables a radically different
strategy: to measure metabolic tissue secretomes directly in living animals (Wei et al., Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020).
Importantly, this chemical strategy provides unique insights into the composition and dynamics of secretomes
in mice that could not have been predicted by existing in vitro or computational approaches. This proposal
seeks to further develop these chemical methodologies with the goal of generating a complete endocrine map
of the secreted polypeptides that mediate peripheral metabolic tissue crosstalk. To achieve this goal, we will
(1) produce a 6 organ, 15-cell type atlas of peripheral metabolic tissue polypeptide secretomes and determine
how these secretomes are dynamically altered by metabolic perturbations such as obesity, diet, environmental
temperature, and physical activity; (2) develop new in vivo chemistries that enable high-resolution mapping of
secreted polypeptide fragments produced via proteolytic cleavage events; and (3) integrate metabolic tissue
secretomes into endocrine circuits through in vivo chemical pulse-chase approaches. Successful completion
of this high-risk, high-reward project will provide a chemical toolbox for dissecting cellular secretomes, open
potentially important new areas in tissue crosstalk, and ultimately enable the long-term vision of “capturing”
the pathways of tissue crosstalk to combat obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic disorders."
10897800,"This project will test the effectiveness and equity of a multicomponent adherence intervention on adherence to
medications prescribed for two common chronic conditions, breast cancer (BC) and cardiovascular disease
(CVD). Among adults with chronic illness, 30% to 50% of medications are not taken as prescribed, and this
medication nonadherence is associated with higher risk of death, hospitalizations, and high costs. Race,
ethnicity, and income are consistent predictors of nonadherence and poor health outcomes. Thus, improving
adherence has the potential to reduce health disparities. For both BC and CVD, there are large disparities in
health outcomes. Black and Hispanic adults have the highest risk of inadequate CVD risk factor control, and
BC mortality rate is 40% higher in Black women compared to White women. Decades of research have
revealed that those few medication adherence interventions that are effective have been complex, costly, and
difficult to scale. Further, there has been insufficient attention paid to considering equity during intervention
design. The scientific premise is that an equity and design-informed adherence intervention will increase
adherence to BC and CVD medication. To accomplish this, we will refine a theory-informed intervention with
input from a diverse group of patient and provider stakeholders as part of human-centered “design with justice”
process. We will then conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in 300 patients with comorbid BC and
CVD risk factors to determine the effectiveness of a targeted, personalized multicomponent adherence
intervention versus usual care on adherence to CVD (statins and antihypertensives) and BC (endocrine
therapy) medications. Key components of the intervention are expected to include pharmacist-directed
medication regimen optimization, patient portal access and training, optional smartphone reminder application,
pharmacy fill adherence monitoring and feedback, with optional step-up in care to community healthcare
worker-led motivational interviewing for persistently nonadherent patients. We will evaluate the intervention’s
effectiveness on combined medication adherence (primary outcome) as well as clinical outcomes (blood
pressure, LDL) and proposed mechanisms of action (regimen complexity, medication adherence self-efficacy),
and will assess equity by comparing outcomes among patients in underrepresented minorities and low-income
groups. Finally, we will use mixed methods to assess determinants of equitable implementation and to
determine barriers and facilitators to implementation and sustainability at the patient, clinic, and health system
level. To our knowledge, this will be the first pragmatic trial to investigate an intervention to equitably improve
adherence to medications for multiple chronic conditions in a diverse cohort of patients. If successful, this
intervention will result in an intervention that can be disseminated across our network and to the broader health
system."
10897805,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
African American (AA) adults are more likely to contract and die from Colorectal Cancer (CRC) than any other
racial group in the U.S. AAs are the least likely to undergo CRC screening, have precancerous colorectal
polys removed, and have CRC detected at stages early enough for curative excision. Lower screening rates
are linked to the downstream effects of structural racism and other socio-ecological factors. Although reducing
the mortality from CRC is best accomplished by screening, compelling evidence links inflammatory diets and
other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors to increased risk of CRC. Black churches are central
institutions in AA communities that can help increase access to CRC screening and address CVD risk factors.
Community Health Workers (CHWs), who are trusted paraprofessionals from the target community, may be
able to bridge the connection between CRC screening and CVD risk factors through church-based intervention
delivery. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive, culturally tailored community-
based CRC prevention model with a dual emphasis on reducing CRC risk along with its CVD risk factors. The
study intervention has two components: Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to
address CRC screening and a web-based lifestyle program called “Alive!” to address CVD risk factors linked to
CRC. The C.H.U.R.C.H. Trial (Community Health workers United to Reduce Colorectal cancer and
cardiovascular disease among people at Higher risk) has four specific aims: (1) to compare the effect of a
CHW-Led SBIRT (Intervention) to Referral As Usual (RAU) (Usual Care) on guideline-concordant CRC
screening uptake; (2) to evaluate the effect of a Culturally Adapted CHW-linked Alive! (CACA) program
incorporated into the intervention arm on dietary inflammatory score (DIS); (3) to evaluate the effect of CACA
on changes in Life Simple-7 (LS7) scores; and (4) to examine the multi-level contextual mechanisms and
factors influencing CHW effectiveness, reach, and implementation of CRC screening uptake and CACA
activities through a mixed-methods process evaluation. Given the broad reach and influence of Black
churches, results from this study can be used to inform future scale up of this multi-pronged intervention."
10884518,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
NIDDK-funded training programs have been essential for fostering the career development of scientists and
physician-scientists tackling questions in the kidney, urology and hematology (KUH) research areas, but these
programs have yielded varying degrees of success. To best meet future challenges, NIDDK understands the
need to train promising individuals for interdisciplinary team science and draw upon extensive, collaborative
resources to establish communities of trainees. Chicagoland is a metro area rich in world-class medical centers
and other resources essential to establish such an interdisciplinary training program and make sustained impacts
on KUH research training. The interdisciplinary Chicago Kidney Urology Hematology network FOR city-Wide
reseArch tRaining and career Development (Chicago KUH FORWARD) brings together 6 public and private
academic institutions that provide unique and complementary training opportunities across Chicagoland. These
critical assets must be coordinated to yield the best training opportunities for fellows and to maximize
effectiveness of the Professional Development, Network and Training Cores. The Administrative Core will
ensure effective function of Chicago KUH FORWARD through establishing shared governance, collaborative
workflow, continual assessment and improvement, and disseminating the work and successes of trainees
through yearly NIDDK U2C/TL1 KUH Institutional Network meetings. The Specific Aims of the Administrative
Core are: 1) Establish an organizational and governance structure fostering communication, collaboration and
integration; 2) Develop comprehensive program evaluation, data review and cycles of improvement; 3) Establish
an External Evaluation Board (EEB) for performance and diversity oversight; and 4) Organize a meeting of the
NIDDK U2C/TL1 KUH Institutional Network. The Administrative Core will be directed by Dr. Alfred George, who
has extensive experience in the oversight of training programs, shared leadership of the George M. O'Brien
Kidney Research Core Center at Northwestern University (NU-GoKIDNEY) and leadership of large collaborative
research projects, which have necessitated oversight and management of multiple subcontracts. Dr. Pinelopi
Kapitsinou will serve as the Co-Director and she has experience in co-leading a NU-GoKIDNEY Research Core.
They will be assisted by dedicated Program Coordinator and Manager, who will serve all aspects of the program

evaluation will lend their expertise to ensure continual cycles of evaluation and improvement. An inter-
institutional Steering Committee with shared leadership and representation of all stakeholders will foster equitable
governance among disciplines and institutions. Together, successful completion of these Aims and effective
function of the Administrative Core will result in an interdisciplinary and collaborative environment that draws
upon the unique and complementary strengths of our world-class research institutions to train the next generation
of KUH researchers. This training environment will contribute to an important nationwide Institutional Network."
10884520,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CORE
The incorporation of professional development education into current pre- and postdoctoral training programs
requires a paradigm shift from outdated strategies that rely on passive didactic learning environments or top-
down training from a single mentor. The Professional Development Core of the Chicago Kidney Urology
Hematology network FOR city-Wide reseArch tRaining and career Development (Chicago KUH FORWARD)
will augment cross-disciplinary mentorship and hands-on research experiences with a transformative
professional development program that leverages adult learning theory, emphasizes active participation
through faculty- and peer-led small group settings and deploys experiential learning approaches for career
development training. The overarching goal of the Professional Development Core is to advance the
professional skills of trainees essential for ensuring successful careers in the KUH fields. Strategies to
accomplish the Core's objectives include active learning in small group settings; opportunities for acquisition of
discipline-specific and interdisciplinary knowledge and new skills in team science, technology innovation and
entrepreneurship; individualized career planning; and tailored experiences that encourage career exploration in
a cross-disciplinary setting. The deliberately selected Core activities form a rich matrix of professional
development resources that map to the Chicago KUH FORWARD basic and interdisciplinary core
competencies. The Specific Aims of the Core are: 1) To build professional skills using an active learner model
that leverages both faculty-to-trainee and peer-to-peer interactions; 2) To deliver both core and tailored didactic
programs for the acquisition of new knowledge and skills to enhance trainee competitiveness in the transition
to independent investigator; 3) To enhance career exploration and planning that optimizes post-training
placement, career satisfaction, sustained professional development, and contribution to the KUH fields; and 4)
To train faculty mentors to adopt mentoring best practices and to provide mentorship training to trainees. The
Professional Development Core will be co-led by Drs. Aline Martin and Robert Liem, whose collective
experiences in mentoring trainees across the spectrum of career development will serve them well in

assisted by experts in teaching grant writing skills to trainees, STEM education, interdisciplinary graduate
training, and mentor development. Continuous cycles of evaluations and refinement of strategic approaches
will ensure that Core activities are well integrated across all institutions, in line with overall vision and mission
of Chicago KUH FORWARD and complement the goals of the Network and Training Cores. In synergizing
with Chicagoland CTSA-funded institutions and the NIGMS-funded Postdoc Academy, the Professional
Development Core will increase trainee competitiveness, support successful career transitions, improve
retention of trainees in research settings and, ultimately, enhance research impact in the KUH fields."
10884523,"PROJECT SUMMARY: NETWORK CORE
Professional advancement of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows is critical to assure a sustained
research workforce and to inspire a new generation of trainees. Too often, graduate students and postdoctoral
fellows are isolated, unaware of opportunities available to them and lack access to cross-disciplinary mentors.
These factors could contribute to the intertwined challenges in recruitment, advancement and retention of
trainees. The 6 public and private academic institutions that compose the interdisciplinary Chicago Kidney
Urology Hematology network FOR city-Wide reseArch tRaining and career Development (Chicago KUH
FORWARD) are deeply committed to developing a city-wide environment encompassing a continuum of
education, training and career development, within which aspiring researchers have access to ideas,
successful role models, peer trainees, scientific information, and methodological support. The primary goal of
the Network Core is to foster a vibrant community, in which trainees will feel valued, supported and connected
and will be eager to pay it forward through interactions with high school, college and medical students.
Strategies to accomplish the Core's objectives include cultivation of a dynamic community of trainees who will
develop kinship with peers, alumni and mentors through professional and social interactions; creation of
personal support teams of peers and near-peers to guide career development; maintenance of continuous
interactions through electronic platforms; and contribution to high school, college and medical student outreach
activities. The Specific Aims of the Core are: 1) To cultivate an engaged, supportive and inclusive city-wide
KUH community by connecting trainees professionally and socially with peers, research training alumni and
mentors; 2) To promote creation of support teams for career guidance by facilitating small group sessions for
peer and near-peer mentoring and coaching; 3) To enhance connectivity, collaboration and career
development by creating an online portal for sustained trainee interaction; 4) To attract new talent to KUH
research by exposing participants of existing outreach programs to Chicago KUH FORWARD trainees. The
Network Core will be co-led by Drs. William Schnaper and Luisa Iruela-Arispe, whose collective experiences in
mentoring trainees will serve them well in overseeing the implementation, management and evaluation of the
Specific Aims. Drs. Schnaper and Iruela-Arispe will be assisted by experts in peer mentoring and coaching and
leaders of high school, college and medical schools outreach programs. Continuous cycles of evaluations and
refinement of strategic approaches will ensure that Core activities are well integrated across all institutions, in
line with overall vision and mission of Chicago KUH FORWARD and complement the goals of the
Professional Development and Training Cores. In synergizing with existing KUH events in Chicago and robust
outreach programs, the Network Core will foster a true community of trainees, who in addition to receiving
expert cross-disciplinary mentorship, constantly learn from each other and inspire the next generation."
10851854,"The Career Enhancement Core (CEC) is essential for meeting the Center for Social Capital (SoCa) mission of
reducing cancer incidence in persistent poverty areas (PPAs). The SoCa CEC will implement a multipronged
approach to support early stage investigators entry, retention, and progression into conducting cancer health
disparities research among the most impoverished populations. To this end, we develop the SoCa Method which
we define as the development of a sustainable infrastructure for a social network where the established norms
of the network produce the expectation of entry, retention, and progression of investigators in cancer health
disparities, advancing the individual and the collective goals of the community. To this end, the CEC will leverage
existing programs and build needed programming, harmonizing collective efforts that activates and supports
sustained movement of early stage investigators across the biomedical enterprise with the expertise needed to
serve underserved communities. The CEC will support entry by developing web-based programmatic
infrastructure to identify and aid established investigators in securing diversity supplements (DSs) that will
support all eligible stages of early stage investigators (from as early as high school through junior faculty support)
who are dedicated to cancer health disparities in impoverished communities (Aim1). To retain early stage
investigators dedicated to serving underserved communities, we will implement a Clinical Research Coordinator
Training Program for undergraduates, post baccalaureates, and master’s students that will facilitate entry into
clinical coordinator positions within persistent poverty communities (Aim 2). To progress early stage
investigators, we will provide a personalized approach to team-based mentoring and training to bolster the
scholars’ ability to compete effectively for external research funding, to strengthen promotional packages, and
instill cancer research in PPAs within their portfolio (Aim 3).
 The CEC objectives are leveraged by unparalleled resources including the outstanding training and
educational programs at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), Cornell University (CU), and
Downstate Health Sciences University (Downstate), as well as, available core resources including the Clinical
and Translational Science Awards (CTSA) and the affiliated Cancer Centers. The CEC will work collaboratively
with the SoCa Center Cores (Research and Methods, Development, and Administrative Core), Advisory Board,
and Projects to support the SoCa Center’s overall mission. The CEC will support the submission of ≥40 DSs,
clinical research coordinator training of 20 students, and personalized training of 12 SoCa Scholars across the
granting period. Supported by the Core Co-Directors (Drs. Yazmin Carrasco and Jasmine McDonald), SoCa
Center Faculty, and cross-institutional opportunities within and across CU, CUIMC, and Downstate - the CEC
will create sustainable and scalable infrastructures and programs that increase biomedical workforce diversity."
10851857,"The Development Core (DC) will contribute to the SoCa Center’s mission to reduce cancer health inequities in
persistent poverty areas (PPAs) in the New York City (NYC) Region by helping junior faculty, especially from
groups underrepresented in the biomedical workforce (URiBW), develop new pilot research projects and
preliminary data necessary for future extramural funding, and successfully compete for K and R-level grant
mechanisms. The SoCa DC builds on a 20-year track record of exemplary outcomes among programs that
promote diversity in the biomedical research workforce at Downstate Health Sciences University (Downstate),
Cornell University (CU) and Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC).
To address career development barriers, the DC will fund innovative pilot projects, led by early career faculty
from URiBW backgrounds at SoCa partnering institutions. The DC pilot project recipients will be fully integrated
into training and mentoring opportunities funded through the Career Enhancement Core (CEC), have access to
a robust Research and Methods Core (RMC) to support the pilot projects, and participate in networking and
career development activities organized by the Administrative Core (ADMIN). Further, we will fully integrate the
SoCa Community Advisory Board (CAB) as partners in the prioritization, co-production, and dissemination of
pilot projects, and review of future proposal submissions. In Aim 1, we will establish a SoCa pilot project program
that will support 25 cancer health equity pilot projects (5 per year). The SoCa DC will directly fund 2 pilot projects
per year. Downstate, CUIMC, and CU will each provide additional pilot funds to maximize cancer equity research
activities. URiBW early career faculty from Downstate, CUIMC, CU, and SoCa Scholars are eligible to apply. In
Aim 2, we will enhance collaboration and synergy to develop new pilot project ideas by coordinating a SoCa
Hub, which will provide centralized resources for URiBW early career investigators to participate in longstanding
research cohort studies. SoCa Hub resources will be housed and maintained on the SoCa website as described
in the ADMIN. URiBW faculty across all Minority Serving Institutions in NYC with an interest in cancer health
equity will be eligible to participate. In Aim 3, we will expand a Mock Study Section program, that will engage
participants from the SoCa Hub, SoCa Scholars (from CEC), SoCa pilot project PIs with opportunities to undergo
an NIH-level review process for K or R-level grant submissions. Mock Study Sections will be comprised of SoCa
faculty with NIH review experience. The SoCa DC will develop a critical mass of diverse scientists who will
promote cancer health equity in NYC persistent poverty areas."
10852003,"Project Summary
 Current approaches to treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remain unsatisfactory. There
remains an unmet need to establish novel alternative therapies that can both exert targeted effects on
cancer cells as well as stimulate an anti-cancer immune response that may render additional opportunity
for combination with emerging immunotherapy. We have uncovered a novel onco-metabolic feature in TNBC
wherein cancer cells exploit a sphingomyelin lipid scavenging phenotype that is targetable through repurposing
of the selective glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor eliglustat, an FDA approved drug for treatment of Gaucher
Disease. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that eliglustat promotes accumulation of mitotoxic ceramides with
resultant shift from survival mitophagy to lethal mitophagy and subsequent cancer cell death. Moreover, we show
that eliglustat suppresses tumor growth at clinically achievable doses in TNBC tumor-bearing mice and that the
anti-cancer effects of eliglustat are associated with pronounced increases in tumor infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+
T-cells, suggesting an additional role of eliglustat in potentiating an anti-tumor immune response. The primary
objectives of this proposal are to establish novel utility for eliglustat as an ‘immunometabolic adjuvant’ for the
treatment of TNBC and to also define the mechanism(s) by which eliglustat potentiates an anti-cancer immune
response. To test this, we will assess the anti-cancer efficacy of eliglustat in patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
models generated from patients with primary treatment-naïve TNBC that did or did not go on to respond to
chemotherapy (Specific Aim 1a). To test whether the combination of eliglustat plus anti-PD-L1 yields improved
anti-cancer effects compared to either treatment alone, we will use the BRCA1co/co; MMTV-Cre; p53+/- and
4T1 orthotopic syngeneic mouse models of TNBC (Specific Aim 1b). Primary endpoints of interest for in vivo
studies will be overall survival and tumor growth; effects on the tumor immunophenotype following intervention
will be assess using multiplex immunofluorescence panels and single cell transcriptomics for single cell-level
expression profiling of tissues. We also aim to define the mechanisms by which eliglustat induces an anti-cancer
immune response. First, we will evaluate the effect of eliglustat on cGAS-STING signaling proteins and
downstream pathway activities in TNBC cells (Specific Aim 2a). Next, we will use advanced mass spectrometry
technologies coupled with novel isolation methods for extracellular vesicles (EVs) to define the MHC-I bound
peptidome on surfaces of TNBC cells and TNBC-derived circulating and intra-tumor EVs following eliglustat
treatment. ELIspot and Cytotoxic T Cell-based tumor killing live-cell assays will be used to test the functionality
of EVs on activating T-cells ex vivo (Specific Aim 2b). If successful, our potential findings will provide key pre-
clinical evidence for the use of eliglustat and justification for moving eliglustat into early phase clinical trials.
Given that eliglustat is already FDA-approved for another indication, it has high potential to be readily translated
into clinical use, and potentially providing a new paradigm for cancer immunotherapy."
10848444,"Project Summary: The operation of RNA polymerases (RNAPs) relies on numerous conformational changes.
During eukaryotic transcription, RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) encountering oxidative lesions in its DNA template
often leads to misincorporation and transcriptional stalling. These events contribute to tumor growth in skin
cancer. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes lethal tuberculosis and is responsible for over 1 million deaths
per year. Transcription initiation complexes of Mtb RNAP, especially the DNA loading gate, are effective targets
for the development of antibiotics. Revealing the dynamics of transcription initiation can thus provide novel
mechanistic insights into prokaryotic transcription and greatly facilitate the understanding of inhibition
mechanisms for antibiotics targeting Mtb RNAP. These two important biological problems in transcription drive
us to develop novel methodology using the generalized master equation (GME) to model biomolecular
conformational changes. My group has been successful in developing GME methods that explicitly consider the
memory functions of biomolecular dynamics and outperform the popular Markov State Model (MSM) method.
However, as an emerging approach, the current implementation of GME is prone to instability when estimating
memory functions for complex RNAP systems. We here propose novel methods to build GME models. Our
specific aims are: 1. To develop new GME methods to model conformational changes. Specifically, to derive a
new theory (IGME) to solve the GME, to develop efficient implementations of the GME to enhance numerical
stability when computing memory kernels from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, and to create a
protocol tailor-made for building GME models to study biomolecular conformational changes. Our preliminary
work shows that the proposed IGME method greatly outperforms the original implementation of GME in yielding
robust and accurate predictions of the biomolecular dynamics, especially for the complex RNAP system. 2. To
reveal how the dynamic coupling of several key conformational changes (i.e., the loading of NTP, the rotation of
the damaged DNA base, and the translocation of Pol II on the DNA template) leads to transcriptional
mutagenesis and/or stalling. Specifically, to construct GME models to elucidate molecular mechanisms of 8-oxo-
guanine (8OG) and Guanidinohydantoin (Gh) lesions induced ATP misincorporation and/or transcriptional
stalling. 3. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional initiation and its inhibition of Mtb RNAP.
Specifically, to construct GME models to reveal the dynamics of the Mtb RNAP’s loading gate without DNA, and
to further reveal the dynamics for the transition from a partially formed transcription bubble to a fully formed
bubble, a conformational change involving both Mtb RNAP’s gate opening and DNA unwinding. We further aim
to understand the recognition mechanisms of multiple antibiotic compounds, including Myxopyronin (Myx) and
Fidaxomicin (Fdx) that target the loading gate motion, and Sorangicin (Sor) that inhibits the formation of the full
transcription bubble. These mechanistic insights will facilitate the rational design of new inhibitors fighting drug
resistance of Mtb in the long term. Throughout our studies, we will work closely with our experimental
collaborators to conduct biochemical, time-resolved X-ray, and Cryo-EM experiments to test and validate our
predictions. Our innovative GME methods will provide a general computational framework to model functional
conformational changes of biomolecules. Our developed protocol and associated code development in the
MSMBuilder software will widely benefit the biophysics community."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a common, progressive, and ultimately fatal brain disease. Currently approved
treatments provide only minimal symptomatic benefits and do not stop the disease from progressing. The field
is in dire need of novel drug targets which could lead to disease-modifying therapies. The most common
genetic risk factor for AD is the ε4 variant of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4). The effect of APOE4 varies
greatly between people of African ancestry and people of European ancestry. The current study—Illuminating
the APOE Locus with Long-Read Sequencing and Targeted Genomics—will apply a new genome sequencing
technology (long-read sequencing) to the study of APOE and several other AD-relevant genes including
ABCA7. Long-read sequencing will be performed on DNA from roughly 2000 African-Americans with AD and
2000 healthy older African-American control subjects as well as DNA from roughly 5000 European-American
AD patients and 5000 European-American controls. A subset of these patients will also have long-read
sequencing of these genes’ RNA derived from white blood cells, fibroblasts, or brain tissue. These analyses
will help us understand how local genetic variants near the APOE4 variant can alter the type or amount of the
APOE4 protein and how this affects risk of AD. Similar analyses will be done on ABCA7 and another 15-20
targeted genes that will be selected just before sequencing begins and following an up-to-date review of the
AD genetics literature. In addition to understanding the local variants regulating a gene and the protein it
produces, long-read sequencing will be useful in detecting large, damaging genetic mutations that are easily
missed with standard whole-genome sequencing. The results will allow for more specific estimates of AD risk
in individuals of diverse ancestral backgrounds and will provide novel targets for drug development."
10783052,"Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases and brain cancers are challenging to treat due to the presence of blood brain barrier
(BBB), which is formed by tight junctions between endothelial cells in the microvasculature of the brain and
prevents most of the therapeutics from access to the brain tissues. Among several reported approaches,
ultrasound (US) has been demonstrated to be the most effective and safe method to facilitate the BBB opening.
External US is however limited in efficacy to small animals whose skull bone is thin. In the case of humans, the
thick skull bone absorbs more than 90% of US energy, requiring large and bulky arrays of external US
transducers, which often consumes several hours of stimulation and requires tedious MRI monitoring during the
sonication. Moreover, this extensive process is only useful for a single-time stimulation while research has shown
the opening of BBB requires repetitive application of US. Implanted US transducers have thus emerged as an
excellent alternative. Unfortunately, commercial US transducers rely on conventional piezoelectric materials,
which contain toxic elements such as Lead in PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) and are non-degradable, therefore
requiring invasive brain-surgery for removal. To overcome these problems, the PI’s group has recently developed
a new biodegradable piezoelectric transducer, based on Poly-L-Lactide (PLLA). PLLA however has a modest
piezoelectric constant and thus cannot generate a powerful US to open the BBB deep inside the brain tissue.
Glycine, a biodegradable and safe amino acid, has been found to possess an extremely high piezoelectric
constant, even comparable to that of piezoelectric ceramics like PZT. Unfortunately, glycine crystals are brittle
and difficult-to-handle, rendering the material challenging to be used for high performance piezoelectric US
transducer. Here, we propose a new strategy for material processing and device fabrication to (1) manufacture
a biodegradable, flexible, easy-to-use, and highly piezoelectric nanofiber film of glycine crystals embedded inside
a polycaprolactone (PCL) polymeric matrix and (2) employ this flexible glycine/polymer nanofibers to create a
powerful US transducer which is implanted into the brain to facilitate drug-delivery through the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) for the treatment of brain cancers. Our major hypothesis is that; the glycine-based ultrasound transducer
will be able to provide a sufficient acoustic wave which can facilitate a safe and transient opening of BBB for the
diffusion of anti-cancer drugs through the BBB to treat brain cancers. To demonstrate the hypothesis, we design
the project with three specific aims. Aim 1 is to assess the piezoelectric performance, characterize the functional
lifetimes, and evaluate acoustic field from the glycine/PCL transducer in vitro. Aim 2 is to asses safety (local and
systemic toxicity) of the implanted transducer and the applied US in a large animal model. Aim 3 is to assess
anti-tumor efficacy of the treatment using the implanted transducer + anti-cancer drugs in vivo."

 The overall goals of this research proposal are to define specific pathways of sphingolipid metabolism,
define specific roles, define mechanisms, and help place the field of bioactive lipids on solid mechanistic
grounds. Based on strong ongoing data, we propose the overall hypothesis that individual enzymes of
ceramide metabolism serve as transducers of specific inputs, and the product bioactive sphingolipids function
to mediate key responses. This proposal will develop this paradigm in the case of the DNA damage response
and other stimuli activating mammalian and yeast neutral sphingomyelinases in distinct compartments leading
to formation of compartmentalized and species-specific ceramides. We propose the following major goals: 1.
Advance our understanding of structure and activation of nSMase2; 2. Develop tools and approaches
to probe compartment-specific functions of bioactive sphingolipids and neutral sphingomyelinases; 3.
Define functions and mechanisms of neutral sphingomyelinases in the nucleus, especially in the DNA
Damage Response; and 4. Define mechanisms of regulation of protein phosphatases by ceramides. Taken
together, we endeavor to advance our understanding of bioactive sphingolipids and reduce the complexities of
the field to manageable and specific components that promise to shed important light on how these specific
pathways function, and their specific roles in stress responses. The ongoing results are defining totally
unexpected roles for neutral sphingomyelinases in distinct compartments, including the eukaryotic DNA
damage response through a nuclear lipid-mediated pathway. These are critical towards the understanding of
human disease (cancer) and therapeutics."
10916181,"Metastatic melanoma is the most aggressive type of skin cancer with no treatment. Acquisition of invasive
phenotypes is a critical event driving progression from primary to metastatic melanoma which is most detrimental
for patient survival in THE case of melanoma brain metastases (MBMs).
 Invasion of melanoma cells depends on activation of several RHO-GTPases which regulate the biogenesis
of cell protrusions. Among RHO-GTPases, RAC1 plays the most prominent role in melanoma progression.
Indeed, P29S activating mutation of RAC1 (detected predominately in melanoma) is the 3rd most common
mutation in sun-exposed melanomas. In addition, RAC1 and other RHO-GTPases function as effectors and/or
regulators of signal transduction programs activated in MBMs, including MAPK, PI3K/AKT or STAT3 pathways.
However, mechanisms regulating RHO-GTPase activity in melanoma in general or in MBMs are understudied.
 Physiological changes of intracellular GTP have not been thought to regulate RHO-GTPase activity because
total GTP levels in the cell were considered to be much higher than GTP dissociation constant of RHO proteins
(KdRHO•GTP). In our papers (Bianchi-Smiraglia et al. Nature Methods 2017 & Nature Communications 2021; Wolff
et al, Cell Chemical Biology 2022), we demonstrated that not only free GTP levels comparable to KdRHO•GTP
existed in the cell, but also that RAC1 activation depended on availability of local free GTP. Furthermore, RAC1
interacted with inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2, a rate limiting enzyme in GTP biosynthesis)
and, through this interaction, with other GTP metabolism enzymes (GMEs). Accordingly, IMPDH2 and GMEs
were enriched together with RAC1 in cell protrusions of invading cells.
 Disruption of IMPDH2-RAC1 interaction via sequestration of IMPDH2 away from the plasma membrane did
not alter total GTP pools, but decreased local GTP levels in cell protrusions, RAC1 activity, and cell invasion.
IMPDH2 and other GTP metabolism enzymes do not contain membrane localization sequences, however, do
associate with the plasma membrane. We also demonstrated that high IMPDH2 levels correlate with poor
prognosis in melanoma patients.
 Thus, in the 1st Specific Aim we will establish the mechanisms that recruit IMPDH2 to plasma membrane and
cell protrusions. In the 2nd Specific Aim, we will identify and characterize mechanisms maintaining high IMPDH2
levels in metastatic melanoma cells. In the 3rd Specific Aim, we will interrogate the inhibition of IMPDH2 as a
novel strategy for treatment of MBMs."
10812269,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The alveolar-capillary membrane facilitates efficient gas exchange while maintaining a restrictive permeability
barrier. Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection disrupts the alveolar-capillary barrier leading to exudative edema
and impaired oxygenation. P. aeruginosa utilizes a type III secretion system and its effectors to disrupt barrier
integrity. In particular, the exoenzyme Y is introduced into lung endothelium, where it acquires nucleotidylyl
cyclase activity and produces cGMP, cAMP, and cUMP. These cyclic nucleotide monophosphates activate
protein kinase A resulting in endothelial tau phosphorylation, tau dissociation from microtubules, and microtubule
breakdown, which collectively hinders repair following infection. Phosphorylated tau is released from
endothelium as cytotoxic variants that contribute to lung injury. The signaling mechanisms used by exoenzyme
Y to produce cytotoxic tau is incompletely understood, yet cUMP is produced at especially high concentrations
and the cUMP signal parallels the generation of cytotoxic tau. Elevations in cUMP are sufficient to promote the
production of cytotoxic tau variants. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the exoenzyme Y-induced cUMP
signal also decreases endothelial nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and increases nicotinamide, the
product of NAD+ hydrolase activity, which may impair recovery following infection. Lung endothelium expresses
sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (SARM1), the only TIR (Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor) domain protein in
mammalian cells that possesses NAD+ hydrolase activity. Recent studies revealed a SARM1 bacterial
homologue is directly activated by cUMP as an essential innate immune mechanism. While our studies illustrate
an important role for cUMP in the endothelial cell response to infection, how exoenzyme Y generates the cUMP
that leads to tau phosphorylation and production of cytotoxic tau variants, and how cUMP lowers NAD+ while
hindering endothelial cell repair remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap in a rigorous way,
this project tests the hypothesis that the P. aeruginosa exoenzyme Y generates cUMP, which contributes to the
tau phosphorylation, microtubule breakdown, and SARM1-dependent NAD+ hydrolase activity that causes lung
injury and hinders repair."
10849889,"Control of gene expression involves interactions between genomic cis-regulatory elements (CREs) and the
transcription factors that bind them, while chromatin modifiers also modulate genome access to control cell
type specification during development. Defining these regulatory controls is important, as most human genetic
variation linked to disease is in non-protein coding sequences, but the locations and functionality of CREs that
specify many developing human cell types has not yet been defined. In the cerebral cortex, balanced
development of inhibitory cortical interneurons (cINs) and excitatory neurons (cEXs) is required for proper
function. cIN development is susceptible to perturbation to cause multiple neurodevelopmental disorders
(NDDs), while NDD contributory mutations are found in many genes encoding chromatin modifiers, linking
disrupted epigenetic regulation of cIN development to NDD etiology. However, most aspects of molecular
regulation of human cIN development remain undefined, including which regulators are required, the CREs
through which these regulators act and networks of gene expression under their control, effects of their
disruption on cIN development, and contributions of human mutations in these genes and CREs to NDDs. To
elucidate these, we use a directed differentiation model that mimics many aspects of human cIN specification
and differentiation, is robust and experimentally manipulable, and has high utility for studying these processes.
 Here, we begin to define the central regulatory logic underlying the cIN developmental program and build a
foundation for studying how its disruption contributes to NDD etiology. We first integrate several types of
genome-wide data to define putative CREs controlling cIN specification. These data will be used to assess how
pathogenic mutations in both CREs and in genes encoding chromatin modifiers disrupt cIN development to
cause NDDs. We next explore roles for CHD2, a gene encoding a chromatin remodeler mutated to cause
several NDDs: we define direct targets of CHD2 regulation, their dysregulation in the context of different
pathogenic CHD2 gene variants, the epigenetic mechanisms involved, and effects of these CHD2 pathogenic
mutations on development and function of cINs and cEXs. This work will elucidate both CHD2's required roles
and mechanisms in cIN development and the basis of their disruption in NDDs. Finally, we conduct massively
parallel reporter analysis: high throughput, quantitative, CRE activity testing is used to identify bona fide
functional CREs, define cis-sequence requirements for CRE regulation during cIN specification, and compare
CRE activity in cIN versus cEX progenitors and with single or combinatorial transcription factor binding site
mutation. A subset of these CREs is then validated by epigenome editing. Together, this work will elucidate the
cis-regulatory logic of a human cell type-specific gene regulatory program central to neurodevelopment and
disease, while building a resource and experimental foundation for further dissection of how pathogenic
variants both in human coding and non-coding genome sequences disrupt this program, contributing to NDDs."
10877079,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project aims to assemble a foundational resource of functional DNA elements, transcription factor (TF)
binding sites and gene regulatory interactions for the Impact of Genomic Variation on Function (IGVF)
consortium. The resource will facilitate interpretation of noncoding genetic variation associated with human
traits and diseases, advance understanding of disease mechanisms and hasten progress towards genomic
medicine.
 A large majority of genetic variants associated with human diseases are non-coding, which has
hindered their interpretation and utility for understanding disease. Non-coding disease variants are enriched
within promoters, enhancers and TF binding sites. Hence, a compelling hypothesis is that they modulate the
activity of functional elements, TF interactions and gene targets in specific cellular contexts. To interpret the
function of a variant, investigators must determine the element and/or TF that they impact, which gene is
affected, and the cell state in which the effect is manifested. This process is greatly facilitated by genome-wide
maps of functional elements, TFs and regulatory interactions. However, existing resources under-represent
disease-relevant functional elements that are specific to early developmental stages, rare cell states,
physiological responses, genotypes or disease states.
 To overcome these limitations, the proposed project will deploy an innovative suite of single-cell assays
to profile RNA transcripts, chromatin accessibility, TF footprints and histone modifications at unprecedented
scale. These assays will be applied to an expansive collection of phenotypically- and genotypically-diverse
BioSamples selected for their relevance to cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune, neuropsychiatric and
neurodegenerative diseases. We will acquire >16 million single-cell profiles for thousands of BioSamples that
span cadaveric tissues, surgical specimens, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cohorts, brain
organoids and other innovative experimental models. Integration of this vast dataset will enable us to (1)
annotate millions of regulatory elements and TF motifs; (2) predict gene targets from co-variation of element
accessibility and gene expression across single cells; and (3) identify quantitative trait loci for gene expression
(eQTLs) and chromatin accessibility (caQTLs) from the diverse genotypes represented in our cohorts.
The project will bring together a diverse team of experts in human genetics, disease biology, genomics and
production research. The team will coordinate closely with IGVF colleagues and the DACC in the design,
assembly and integration of this resource. All data will be made freely available and maximally accessible to
the scientific community, with the goal to catalyze human genetics, disease biology and genomic medicine."
10825597,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 50% of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) relapse after first-line treatment. Chimeric
antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells have recently emerged as a curative therapy for relapsed or refractory (R/R)
DLBCL. However, only 35% of R/R DLBCL patients treated with CAR T-cells have a durable response, and
survival is measured in months for patients who fail to benefit. Improvements in CAR T-cells are urgently required
to improve outcomes. Recently, we identified the cell surface lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTBR) as a positive T-
cell regulator that enhances CD19 CAR T-cell efficacy in vitro and in vivo. LTBR is typically expressed in a subset
of myeloid cells but absent in lymphocytes; however when expressed in T-cells, LTBR induces proinflammatory
cytokine release, and improves antigen-specific CAR T- and γδ T-cell responses with no appreciable off-target
toxicity. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that LTBR can effectively potentiate anti-tumor activity in
R/R lymphoma T-cells, reducing markers of T cell exhaustion and outperforming current FDA-approved CAR-Ts
across R/R DLBCL subtypes. In Aim 1, we characterize differences in expression of T-cell differentiation,
activation, and exhaustion markers and myeloid populations in 25 treatment-naive and 25 R/R DLBCL patient
samples. To understand if LTBR can similarly improve CAR-T response in the R/R context, we will use single-
cell profiling and functional assays to test autologous CD19+ cell killing, with and without LTBR. In Aim 2 we will
evaluate the impact of DLBCL subtype on CAR T-cell activity by introducing LTBR and CAR T-cells into mice
xenotransplanted with multiple germinal center B-cell (GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) cell lines. Since T-cell
activation and kinetics are further influenced by patient tumor burden, we will also investigate the efficacy of
LTBR-CAR T-cell therapy in a high tumor burden context and test for durable immune memory after complete
tumor regression. Recently, by fusing the intracellular signaling domain of LBTR directly to existing (CD28 and
4-1BB) CARs, we have developed a novel CAR construct with more potent antitumor response. In Aim 3 using
comprehensive scanning mutagenesis of the LTBR domain, we will create a library of CAR variants and test
their ability to improve tumor killing, resistance to exhaustion and cytokine section. We will also measure changes
in T-to-B cell immune synapses and resistance to immunosuppression by myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs) in the most promising LTBR-CARs. This project is the first to comprehensively characterize T cells
states in treatment-naive and R/R DLBCL and evaluate LTBR as a T-cell activating strategy to maximize intrinsic
anti-tumor activity in R/R DLBCL. There is substantial potential for our work to serve as a bridge from laboratory
studies to clinical trials and to help the 40,000 patients per year with R/R DLBCL and other B-cell NHLs."

While activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), immunotherapy has yet to be harnessed for targeted
therapy due to GBM’s heterogeneity and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Unleashing immunotherapy
against GBM requires new technologies that activate the tumor microenvironment (TME), while concomitantly
engaging both innate and adaptive arms to generate sustained cellular immunity.
We developed a novel RNA-nanoparticle (RNA-NP) formulation to simultaneously orchestrate innate/adaptive
response against a heterogeneous cohort of personalized tumor derived mRNA. By layering tumor mRNA into
a multi-lamellar nano-lipid formulation (for systemic administration), we can deliver increased antigenic load (per
particle) triggering potent innate activation which then facilitates adaptive effector responses. Our technology
unlocks activity in poorly immunogenic small animal and spontaneous large animal glioma models.
RNA-NPs activate systemic/intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs), upregulate critical innate gene signatures in the
glioma TME, and induce glioma-specific T cell immunity. In murine tumor models resistant to immune checkpoint
inhibitors, RNA-NPs induce robust anti-tumor efficacy with long-term survivor benefits. We have previously
demonstrated safety of RNA-NPs in acute/chronic murine GLP toxicity studies, and launched a large animal
canine glioma trial (IACUC#201609430). Our canine trial demonstrated that RNA-NP administration is feasible,
safe and immunologically active with improvement in overall survival in pet dogs with terminal gliomas (compared
with historical controls). We have since received FDA-IND approval (BB-IND#19304, Sayour) for first-in-human
studies in GBM patients.
In this proposal, we will explore mechanistic underpinnings for innate modulation and adaptive response
following RNA-NPs. Our experiments will be conducted in clinically relevant small and large animal glioma
models, which recapitulate many human GBM features before translation into a human clinical trial. We
hypothesize that RNA-NPs reprogram the glioma microenvironment unlocking vaccine response across the
BBB. Our SPECIFIC AIMS will be to:
1. Establish RNA-NPs as innate biomodulators of glioma immunogenicity.
2. Elucidate mechanistic interactions between innate and adaptive anti-glioma immunity following tumor
specific RNA-NPs.
3. Determine in a neoadjuvant clinical trial design the modulating effects and immunogenicity of RNA-
NPs in recurrent GBM patients."

Azetidines, azetines, and oxetanes are four-membered heterocycles that exhibit desirable pharmacokinetic
effects and represent important building blocks in current medicinal chemistry. Cycloaddition reactions
between alkenes and imines or carbonyls, also referred to as (aza) Paternò-Büchi reactions, represent the
most direct synthetic approach to access these compounds, however the current utility of these
transformations is highly restricted due to the stringent requirement of UV-light and competing reaction paths
accessible upon photochemical excitation. Thus, the ability to incorporate functionalized azetidines, azetines,
and oxetanes into pharmaceutical lead structures is currently severely limited due to a lack of efficient synthetic
methods. To date, no visible light-based platform of general synthetic utility for cycloadditions between alkenes
and imines or carbonyls exists. The objective of the proposed research program is to identify and develop
chemical strategies that enable efficient cycloadditions between these functional groups to access azetidines,
azetines, and oxetanes based on energy transfer catalysis facilitated by visible light.
These new synthetic methods will provide general and modular protocols for the synthesis of a large variety of
heterocyclic motifs that are highly desirable in current medicinal chemistry. Additionally, the strategies
described will enable cycloaddition reactions between alkenes and imines or carbonyls under mild reaction
conditions with high functional group tolerance as they forego the requirement of UV-light. The utility of the
accessible 4-membered heterocycles as building blocks will be demonstrated in secondary modifications and
by enabling the synthesis of biologically active target structures from commercially available starting materials.
The compounds prepared within this research program will be incorporated into the compound library
maintained by the Center for Chemical Genomics (CCG) at the University of Michigan and become part of
high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches for biological research and new drug discovery projects.
In summary, the research described will enable general, catalytic strategies for aza Paternò-Büchi and
Paternò-Büchi reactions relying on energy transfer upon excitation with visible light. These new
transformations represent desirable synthetic tools that will enable direct access to functionalized azetidines,
azetines, and oxetanes, and are expected to have broad implications in the area of medicinal chemistry."
10846725,"The goal of this interdisciplinary team science proposal is to extend and inform biochemical and structural
biology approaches for studying membrane proteins by understanding how their native environments define
structure and function. To date, the majority of mechanistic studies of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) have
not captured the properties and functional contributions of the membranes in which the IMPs are embedded.
The central goal of our collaborative team is to develop new technologies and approaches that will allow us to:
i.) Define lipid components and protein co-receptor components of functional complexes; ii.) Evaluate the role
of the local membrane environment in function and regulation of the IMPs; and iii.) Determine the structures of
these assemblies. Driven – and made possible – by the recruitment of six key junior faculty to the Departments
of Pharmacology and Cell Biology over the past 5 years, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team with
shared interest in transmembrane protein structure and function. Our team members bring complementary
expertise to the project with skills in cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM), top-down and bottom-up mass
spectrometry (MS), multi-omic analysis, optical imaging, biochemistry, and cellular signaling. We are very well
placed to make unique advances in understanding membrane proteins involved in regulation of bacterial
lipopolysaccharide synthesis, insect olfaction, mammalian ion channels, and mammalian receptors in the G
protein-couple receptor (GPCR), Frizzled, and receptor tyrosine kinase families. Our Specific Aims are:
1: Identify native environments of integral membrane proteins
To achieve this, we will identify new membrane-active copolymers that efficiently extract IMPs of interest, and
use state-of-the-art lipidomics, proteomics, and native mass spectrometry to elucidate the molecular
components of the protein’s membrane environment.
2: Understand how the native membrane environment modulates or determines membrane protein function
Using a wide variety of assays – tailored to each IMP – we will ask how the specific membrane environment
identified in Aim 1 influences IMP activity and oligomerization. We will also use limited proteolysis and H/D
exchange mass spectrometry approaches to assess the influence of the membrane composition on
conformation and structural dynamics
3: Determine structures of membrane proteins and complexes in native membrane environments
We will determine structures of the target IMPs in defined membrane environments using cryoEM, to ask how
known specific IMP-associated lipids and other components interact with and modulate IMP structure."
10875371,"SUMMARY
We will focus on a previously largely under-explored but highly relevant time window in progression of
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), i.e., `early atrophic AMD'. We postulate that a therapeutic effect
in early atrophic AMD would probably save a large proportion of patients from progressive visual function loss
and that it seems more justifiable to risk interventions in this time window than in earlier AMD stages. Against
this background, a comprehensive knowledge of the natural disease progression in this potential
therapeutic margin is essential. We will implement innovative multimodal high-resolution retinal imaging,
comprehensive functional testing, and assessment of vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) combined with
standardized and exploratory analysis strategies in a prospective, longitudinal study. This will enable us to
characterize and quantify the microstructural changes and associated functional and VRQoL deficits in
eyes with early atrophic lesions with unprecedented accuracy. Knowledge of the strongest risk factors for
accelerated disease progression will allow identification of patients at highest risk for visual function loss.
Moreover, our hypothesis on disease-stage specific risk-factors may guide selection of therapeutic targets that
are particularly susceptible in early atrophic AMD. Tailoring therapeutics to specific phenotypes and disease
stages may be key to prevent irreversible vision loss and the associated reduced quality of life in patients with
AMD."

The role and mechanism of RNA m6A modification in the pathogenesis and drug-resistance of prostate cancer
PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT):
Background: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is the most prevalent and abundant internal modification in
eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and plays diverse and important roles in normal biological processes.
Emerging evidence suggest that m6A and m6A-assicated proteins also play critical roles in human diseases
including cancers. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer with the second leading
estimated deaths at the United States for more than a decade. Androgens and androgen receptor (AR) regulate
normal growth and function of the prostate gland. However, aberrant regulation of androgens and AR signaling
pathway are closely associated with PCa pathogenesis and progression. Thus, androgen deprivation therapies
(ADT) or targeting AR function have always been the mainstay of therapeutic strategy against advanced prostate
cancers. However, the current therapeutic strategies cannot cure most PCa patients due to drug resistance and
relapse, and eventually develop metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a lethal stage of the
disease. The acquired resistance to abiraterone and enzalutamide is considered as the main problem for the
treatment failure and relapse of PCa. Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
PCa pathogenesis and drug resistance, which may contribute to the development of effective new therapeutic
approaches to overcome the limitations of current treatment for PCa. RNA m6A modification is deposited by m6A
methyltransferase complex composed of three core subunits METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP and may have
functions as an important regulator of gene expression that can affect mRNA transcription, splicing, export,
stability, and translation. Previously, we have reported that METTL3-catalyzed m6A modification of target mRNA
plays critical oncogenic roles in human cancers including PCa, but its definitive roles in AR signaling activation
and especially in drug-resistant AR signaling remain elusive. Our preliminary data imply that m6A modification
on enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which are regulatory RNAs transcribed from non-coding enhancer elements, may
also have roles in drug resistance in PCa, which requires further systematic studies. The goal of this proposal is
to prove the central hypothesis that METTL3-mediated RNA m6A modification plays essential roles in AR
signaling, PCa pathogenesis and drug resistance. The m6A methylome of chromatin-associated regulator
RNAs (carRNAs) and nascent RNAs will be mapped, analyzed and correlated with the genome-wide binding of
AR and transcriptional machineries. Also, the role of YTHDC1, a nuclear m6A reader protein, will be systemically
examined to investigate its relationship with the transactivation of AR and genome-wide distribution, as it has
been known to regulate transcriptional activation or repression via binding to m6A-modified RNAs. Loss- and
gain-of-function experiments will address the widespread impact of RNA m6A modification in controlling the
activation of AR signaling and downstream gene expression, and thus will help uncover the molecular
mechanism underlying the role of m6A modification in PCa pathogenesis. Finally, the effects of m6A modification
manipulation in the AR signaling regulation with drug-resistant AR mutations will be explored using a xenograft
PCa mouse model, as well as a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and a panel of assays will be placed to
examine the underlying molecular mechanism. Our proposed study will successfully reveal the role of RNA m6A
modification in AR signaling and PCa pathogenesis, and help evaluate the clinical potential pharmacological
inhibition of m6A modification in PCa, especially metastatic and drug resistant PCa."
10802385,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bulimia nervosa (BN) is a disabling and often chronic eating disorder associated with medical complications and
premature death. There is an acute need to identify the mechanisms that maintain BN and that may serve as
targets for new treatments. Most studies have assumed that BN is perpetuated by stable, trait-like factors,
including self-reported impulsivity and deficits in the ability to exert cognitive control. However, the out-of-control
excessive intake and compensatory behaviors characteristic of BN are episodic and tend to alternate with
periods of restricted intake or even fasting, suggesting intermittent oscillations in control. In addition, emerging
work in behavioral economics and cognitive neuroscience suggests that failures to ultimately exert cognitive
control depend on numerous neural computations, including: updating predictions about whether control will be
needed in the next moment, and deciding whether trying to exert control is worth the costly cognitive effort. The
overarching goal of this R01 is to clarify how these cognitive control computations may fluctuate across fasted
and fed states in BN, potentially maintaining the cyclical nature of the disorder. Specifically, the proposed study
combines functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), computational modeling, and real-time mobile
assessments to examine whether food consumption abnormally impairs frontostriatal function and associated
control-related updating and effort-valuation processes in BN. We propose that the impairment of these
processes in the fed state and relative improvement of these processes in the fasted state perpetuate out-of-
control binge/purge episodes alternating with periods of dietary restriction. We will compare behavioral and
neural responses of women with BN to those of group-matched healthy women during an inhibitory control
paradigm to assess control-related prediction updating (Aim 1) and during a cognitive effort discounting paradigm
to assess control-related effort valuation (Aim 2) in two states: after a 16-h fast and after a standardized meal.
Aim 3 will use multi-modal symptom measures to examine main effects and potential interactions of state-specific
updating and valuation processes on binge eating, purging, and restriction severity at baseline and at 6-month
follow-up. The research team includes experts in BN-focused research, neuroimaging, computational
neuroscience and psychiatry, advanced statistical methods, and ecological momentary assessment. The project
innovatively 1) applies a neurocomputational framework to examine the roles of understudied subcomponents
of cognitive control in BN; 2) assesses the influence of metabolic state (fasted, fed) on these subcomponents;
and 3) relates the dynamics of these subcomponents in the laboratory to real-world, state-specific experiences
and symptoms at baseline and over time. Data from this project will pinpoint altered elements of the control
process that may represent prognostic biomarkers. Results will also identify the potential optimal patient state
(i.e., fasted or fed) for control-focused interventions. Therefore, this study will yield vital data to inform urgently
needed, precisely targeted treatments for cycles of binge eating, purging, and restriction."
10870080,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Down Syndrome – Ambulatory Research in Cognition (DS-ARC) study will develop and validate a
smartphone-based digital cognitive assessment designed specifically for participants at risk for Down
syndrome-associated Alzheimer’s disease (DS-AD). We will partner with sites in London, Barcelona, Munich,
and Gothenburg to develop and validate this approach in different cultures and languages. Nearly all
individuals with Down syndrome have elevated levels of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers by the time they
are in their 30s or 40s, though not all show symptoms of AD. It is during the pre-symptomatic and early
symptomatic stages of DS-AD that an in-depth understanding of cognitive changes is crucial, as therapeutic
interventions to stop, slow, or prevent disease are focused on these critical periods. Typically, prevention trials
and observational studies in AD populations assess cognition with standard “table top” paper and pencil tests.
But these conventional methods have several drawbacks. First, performance is influenced by day to day
fluctuations in stress, fatigue, sleep patterns, and mood. Second, the testing takes place in environments that
are fundamentally different from where cognition is relied upon to function in daily life. Finally, by design,
cognition is typically assessed in “one-shot” in extended testing sessions on an annual or semiannual basis.
 The DS-ARC study will address these difficulties by developing a smartphone-based assessment solution
adapted specifically for individuals with Down syndrome. This approach uses a measurement “burst” design in
which participants complete very brief cognitive tests on their smartphones several times per day for one week
while living in their natural environments. Instead of focusing on one of these measurements, tests are
averaged across the week to provide a score that captures and normalizes natural variability and dramatically
increases reliability. Studies of our original ARC assessments in autosomal dominant and sporadic AD
demonstrate extraordinary reliability and strong relationships with AD biomarkers, while reducing costly and
burdensome in-clinic evaluations. The study has two phases: a 2-year development phase and a 3-year
validation phase. In the development phase, we will adapt an existing smartphone application called the
Ambulatory Research in Cognition (ARC) app for use in DS-AD studies. This will include an iterative pilot
testing process for psychometrics and task development, focus groups and user experience testing to address
accessibility and compatibility concerns for DS-AD populations, and readiness audits to ensure that the DS-
ARC app meets strict compliance guidelines for clinical trial applications. In Phase 2, participants complete DS-
ARC assessments every 6 months and complete standard clinical, cognitive, and blood tests for AD
biomarkers annually. We hypothesize that DS-ARC assessments are accessible, sensitive, and reliable
indicators of cognitive change in DS-AD and will exhibit associations with AD biomarkers and disease stage
over and above those of conventional in-clinic assessments."
10932850,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Introduction: Biomolecular condensates, composed of a concentrated network of
proteins and nucleic acids, compartmentalize cellular biochemistry. The establishment of a precise molecular
composition is critical for the biological functions of condensates. In particular, cells must assemble either (a)
coexisting condensates of distinct composition within a shared environment or (b) coexisting sub-layers of
distinct composition within the same condensate. In both cases, the mechanisms by which cells specify
compositional identity are poorly understood. In this proposal, I will examine how two types of biological
“surfaces,” (a) two-dimensional lipid membranes and (b) one-dimensional long noncoding RNA polymers,
establish condensate identity and dictate the formation of distinct layers. I hypothesize that each type of surface
regulates condensate composition and function by modifying RNA structure in distinct ways. Research: In Aim
1, I will examine how membrane surfaces modify RNA structure to control condensate identity and regulate
mRNA translation in the cytoplasm. In Aim 2, I will examine how the structural features of a long noncoding RNA
control the formation of condensates with discrete layers and regulate mRNA retention in the nucleus. The overall
outcome will be an enhanced, mechanistic understanding of how cells assemble key compartments of mRNA
function. Training: I will complete my training with Prof. Amy Gladfelter at UNC Chapel Hill. During the training
period, I will work with innovative collaborators to acquire new skills that will enable me to probe and manipulate
RNA structure and dissect the molecular driving forces of biomolecular condensation. These skillsets will
accelerate discovery during the remainder of my training and form the foundation for my independent lab.
Specifically, I will learn powerful strategies to (1) map RNA structure with Kevin Weeks at UNC; (2) study long
noncoding RNAs with Mauro Calabrese at UNC; (3) examine the spatial regulation of mRNA translation with
Chris Nicchitta at Duke University; and (4) develop mathematical models of biological self-assembly with Krishna
Shrinivas at Harvard University. Environment: Prof. Gladfelter is a supportive and inspiring mentor who fosters
creativity and collaboration. UNC Chapel Hill is a hub for world-class RNA biology and will provide valuable
opportunities to learn from experienced scientists. This K99/R00 award will enable me to pursue exciting new
research directions beyond my core skillsets, form strong collaborations with leading labs, and immerse myself
in new disciplines through a variety of courses, seminars, workshops, and conferences. Impact on Public
Health: The process of biomolecular condensation has generated intense interest in recent years, in part due to
its role in the formation of pathological aggregates that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis. My work will uncover fundamental mechanisms by which cells control the composition and
emergent functions of biomolecular condensates. Through these discoveries, I hope to aid in the development
of clinical interventions to treat diseases caused by disruptions to this important cellular phenomenon."
10782003,"Project Summary/Abstract
Programed death ligand-1 (PD‐L1) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) that interacts with its receptor,
programmed death‐1 (PD‐1) to inhibit T‐cell activation. Cancer cells adapted to manipulate this mechanism, by
overexpressing PD-L1 to evade immune activation and attack. Therefore, abrogation of PD-L1/PD-1 interaction
by monoclonal antibodies (MAb’s) is an effective therapeutic strategy for several cancers. However, it is
complicated by immune related adverse events (irAEs), including endocrine AEs (eAEs). Thyroid dysfunction,
including destructive thyroiditis and hypothyroidism, are the most common eAEs associated with PD-L1/PD-1
blockade, affecting up to 21% of patients. Because their mechanisms are not known, currently these conditions
are treated symptomatically and as a result, patients are often difficult to manage, and the eAEs can interfere
with the cancer treatment. Therefore, new therapies are needed that target the mechanisms causing eAEs. We
have found that PD-L1, expressed in the thyroid, exerts intrinsic functions in thyroid cells. We have generated
human thyroid cell lines with either downregulated or increased PD-L1 expression and demonstrated that PD-
L1 engages cell survival mechanisms in response to inflammatory cytokine-induced stress. Suppression of PD-
L1 in thyroid cells rendered them more susceptible to cellular stress and apoptosis induced by inflammatory
cytokines. The intrinsic functions of PD-L1 in thyrocytes and their role in the development of ICI thyroiditis have
not been studied before. In this proposal we will dissect the immune-independent functions of PD-L1 in thyroid
cells and their role in the development of ICI-thyroiditis. Our hypothesis is that blockade of PD-L1 in thyroid cells
through anti-PD-L1 therapies, triggers dysregulation of pro-survival intracellular signals controlled by PD-L1,
rendering thyrocytes vulnerable to cytokine mediated destruction. In Aim 1 we will perform cellular and molecular
studies in thyroid cell lines with upregulated and downregulated PD-L1 expression to dissect the intracellular
functions of PD-L1 by assessing: (1) Molecular mediators of PD-L1 intrinsic activity (e.g., signals delivered
through the PD-L1 intracytoplasmic domain); (2) The role of PD-L1 in cellular responses to inflammatory stress;
and (3) The downstream effectors of PD-L1 activity. In Aim 2 we will use a new mouse model of anti-PD-L1
induced thyroiditis we developed to test: (1) How inflammatory cytokines affect the development of anti-PD-L1
induced thyroiditis; and (2) The possibility of reversing/suppressing thyroiditis in this mouse model by restoring
autophagy in thyroid cells. In summary, we are proposing a “two-hit” model for ICI thyroiditis whereby PD-
L1 blockade triggers both: (1) Activation of intra-thyroidal T-cells & inflammatory cytokine secretion; and (2)
Dysregulation of thyrocyte intra-cellular signals making them susceptible to inflammatory cytokine damage. In
this proposal we will dissect the nonimmune roles for PD-L1 in thyroid cells and extend the understating of the
“off-target” effects of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. Our studies will hopefully help design targeted mechanism-
based therapies for ICI associated adverse events in the thyroid and other organs."

and societal impact of the Center. The Core will be led by Drs. Goran (CHLA) and Baezconde-Garbanati (USC)
who provide complementary expertise in clinical/translational research in Latinos and community engagement
and have a track record of working together leading mulit-investigator Centers related to minority health and
health disparities. The Core will be responsible for structuring, initiating, maintaining, and coordinating all Center
activities to ensure that goals are met, including scientific progress, developing a diverse pool of young
investigators, program evaluation, and influencing lasting changes at the community and system levels, through
3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to provide overall leadership and vision as well as scientific, fiscal, and administrative
oversight. This oversight will ensure scientific rigor and maximize interaction between Center cores, research
projects, and pilot studies to ensure integrated efforts in research, training, career development, and community
engagement are met, that team science strategies are utilized, and that trans-disciplinary opportunities are
maximized. Aim 2 is to ensure data quality and harmonization by providing high-level methodological expertise
to the projects and pilot studies through a Methods and Data Sub-Core. By leveraging existing Research Cores,
we will provide efficient and rigorous Center-wide expertise in biostatistics, data management and and
assessment of social determinants of health, dietary intake, and geospatial factors. This will accelerate and
promote transdisciplinary research, integration, and synergy across our Center and the P50 program. Aim 3 is
to conduct ongoing program evaluation to guide the progress and impact of the Center, with a feedback loop for
Center improvements to ensure the Center stays on track and meets its objectives. Ongoing and systematic
evaluation will determine progress towards aims within each project and core, and achievement of milestones

research that addresses the disparities in co-occurring chronic diseases affecting Latinos in Southern California,
including obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia, and that is led by
investigators who are early-career, new to the field, or from underrepresented populations. We will promote and

10889999,"Latinos are disproportionately affected by multiple chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D),
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and dyslipidemia, and this begins in early life. Understanding and
eliminating these disparities is a national priority given the clinical and public health burden associated with these
co-existing chronic diseases. Our work over the last 20 years in Latino infants and children has identified 3
recurring risk factors for these chronic diseases that emerge early in life: 1) formula feeding rather than
breastfeeding, as well as formula type (i.e., formula with added sugar); 2) early introduction of sugar sweetened
beverages and juices (SSB/J), and 3) environmental exposure to air pollution. Despite this, prior work in young
Latino children is limited to assessment of obesity outcomes based on height and weight and lacks robust
measures of adiposity and other sub-clinical markers of future chronic disease risk. In addition, no prior study
has holistically examined these risk factors in the context of broader environmental factors and social
determinants of health (SDOH) that may exacerbate their impact on health outcomes. We propose a
comprehensive study in Latino children to examine the contributions of early-life nutrition, exposure to
environmental toxins, and SDOH on subclinical markers of chronic disease risk at 5y of age. We will leverage 2
NIH-funded birth cohorts led by Dr. Goran (R01DK110793; R01DK109161), which have already thoroughly
characterized early-life exposures in Latino infants from Los Angeles County, with repeated assessments in the
first 2y of life. We will combine these cohorts and collect new outcome measures at 5y of age in the proposed
Early Life Social, Environmental, and Nutritional Determinants of Disease (ELSEND) study. In ELSEND, we will
collect follow-up measures from 190 children at 5y of age using robust subclinical markers of progressive
disease, including non-invasive assessments of fat distribution by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), liver fat
and fibrosis by MRI and elastography, and blood glucose regulation by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
over 7 days. We will update nutritional information and current and cumulative environmental exposures (air
pollution, CalEnviroScreen Index), and will collect new data on broader SDOH, including geospatial assessments
of social and structural factors such as the neighborhood and built environment. This project will address the
following aims: 1) Assess whether early nutrition and/or exposure to environmental toxins is associated with child
growth and/or risk for chronic disease at age 5y; 2) Assess if the food environment and broader SDOH is
associated with subclinical markers of disease and if they exacerbate the adverse effects of poor nutrition and/or
environmental toxins. In addition, by combining data from children across all 3 Center projects, we will also
examine the associations between social and environmental exposures and childhood diet with risk factors for
chronic disease in 530 children across Southern California, and explore whether the efficacy of 3 different family-
based interventions is impacted by individual and/or community level environmental factors."
10890004,"Latino children have higher rates of overweight and obesity (OW/OB) and related chronic diseases, such
as type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and dyslipidemia. This disparity starts early in life, persists
into adulthood, and is associated with a myriad of negative cardiometabolic and psychosocial health
consequences. At present, the most effective program for weight management in children is family-based
treatment (FBT), which is delivered to the target child and a parent (typically the mother). An emerging strategy
is parent-based treatment (PBT), which provides intervention to the parent only, without the child. PBT has
several benefits, including decreased treatment costs, developmental appropriateness for younger children and
potential for broader dissemination. In ongoing trials, we have found that Latino families attend less visits and
consequently treatment in children is less effective. Thus, a tailored program for Latino families is needed that
can address cultural values and capitalize on the value of familismo. The goal of Project 2 is to test the efficacy
of a durable, feasible, culturally relevant program to treat OW/OB and reduce chronic disease risk in Latino
children and their parents. We propose a randomized clinical trial to compare a telehealth PBT for Latino families
with a health education (HE) control group on changes in child and parent weight and chronic disease risk. We
will recruit 160 Latino families consisting of at least one parent with OW/OB, at least one other willing caregiver,
and a 5-10-year-old child with OW/OB and randomize them to 6-month PBT or control. We will assess outcomes
before treatment (month 0), mid-treatment (month 3), post-treatment (month 6), and at 6- and 12-month follow-
up. Specific Aim 1 will compare the efficacy of PBT versus control on child weight (BMIz) over 18 months. Specific
Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of PBT on parent BMI, child and parent diet and physical activity, home food
environment, parent feeding behaviors and parenting confidence and self-efficacy. Specific Aim 3 will determine
the efficacy of PBT on child and parent biomarkers of risk of type 2 diabetes, liver function and dyslipidemia. In
an exploratory aim we will evaluate the impact of potential moderators (e.g., parent and child gender and age,
acculturation level, parent education) and mediators (e.g., change in home food environment, parent feeding
behaviors, family functioning) on intervention efficacy. In a cross-center aim, data from this Project will be
combined with Projects 1 and 3 to examine the multi-level determinants of chronic disease risk in Latino children,
and how social and environmental factors affect the response to different types of interventions in Latino families
for reducing chronic disease risk. The development of interventions for Latino children with OW/OB that address
cultural values around food and the importance of family structure are needed to increase acceptance and
adherence to lifestyle changes, and to improve chronic diseases risk, not just in children but also in parents.
Further, delivering this intervention via telehealth will increase the reach of this intervention, decrease family
burden, lower the cost and make it more broadly appealing for dissemination to a wider audience."
10786142,"Project Summary
Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to complications after major surgery, with rates
approaching 35%. Such complications threaten independence and carry a higher risk of death,
underscoring the importance of careful coordination of care in this population. With ongoing
shortages of surgeons across multiple disciplines, some surgical practices have incorporated
nurse practitioners (NPs) and physician assistants (PAs) who provide the flexibility of
functioning in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. One advantage of this approach
includes improved access to the operating room (e.g., by allowing surgeons to perform
procedures more efficiently) and clinic (e.g., by offloading selected patient visits). Additionally,
this delivery model can enhance care coordination during the index hospitalization, and between
the inpatient and outpatient settings, which may improve surgical outcomes. Potential
disadvantages of this model relate to the relative inexperience of NPs and PAs with respect to
postoperative care, which may result in delayed complication recognition, and the possibility of
increased resource use (e.g., through greater use of diagnostic testing and/or consulting
physicians). This project comprehensively assesses these issues using national Medicare data
and has the following aims: 1) Measure the impact of integration of NPs and PAs into single-
specialty surgical practice on access to care for patients with Medicare; 2) Determine the impact
of integration of NPs and PAs into single-specialty surgical practice on surgical outcomes; and,
3) Assess the impact of NP and PA integration on practices that disproportionately care for
vulnerable Medicare patients. Findings from this study will shed light on how NPs and PAs can
be utilized to improve surgical access and outcomes in Medicare patients, and certain
vulnerable populations in particular. Furthermore, the project will directly inform policymakers,
health system leaders, professional societies and surgeons about the effects of NP/PA
expansion on surgical care in the elderly."

Understanding brain function critically depends on knowing the identities of neural cell types. The olfactory
(piriform, PCx) cortex is the main recipient of afferent inputs from the olfactory bulb and plays key roles in odor
perception and memory. However, we lack a detailed molecular description of piriform cell types and the
molecular machinery that defines their functional properties. Furthermore, and in contrast to sensory and motor
areas in the neocortex, the genetic programs underlying PCx cell lineage specification during development
remain largely unknown. A comparative analysis of cell types in the PCx and neocortex will reveal piriform-
specific cell types and molecular features.
Here, we propose to determine the gene expression and chromatin accessibility states of PCx neurons in the
adult mouse, and to characterize the dynamic interaction of domains of regulatory chromatin and transcription
factor activity that drive cell lineage specification during development. Our central hypothesis is that cell type
identity in PCx is specified during development by the activity of piriform-specific gene regulatory network (GRN)
activity. We further posit that GRN activity in piriform is distinct from neocortex due to the scarcity of epigenetic
mechanisms for transcriptional repression.
Aim 1: to identify molecularly distinct cell types in the adult olfactory cortex of mice. We will
simultaneously measure gene expression and chromatin accessibility states of single cells in the mouse PCx.
We predict that the molecular diversity of piriform neurons matches the diversity of their functional properties.
Aim 2: to determine epigenetic mechanisms of piriform cell lineage specification during development.
We will measure changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in developing piriform neurons and
computationally reconstruct their differentiation trajectories. We predict that cell lineage specification in PCx is
driven by piriform-specific dynamic interactions between domains of regulatory chromatin and associated
transcription factor activity. Aim 3: to reverse engineer a gene regulatory network model for piriform cell
type specification. We will infer data-driven, mechanistic GRN models for piriform and neocortex
(somatosensory cortex S1) development. We will compare GRNs for PCx and neocortex using dynamical
systems theory to test our model that the scarcity of repressive interactions between transcription factors drives
the specification of piriform cell types.
Our work will provide mechanistic insight into the epigenetic control of TF activity during neuronal differentiation
and test the role of TF cross-repression in cell type specification. By integrating experimental data across PCx
and neocortex, we will reveal piriform-specific cell types and the molecular features that specify the functional
properties of the olfactory cortex."
10791865,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed male cancer. Surgery or radiation therapy are curative
treatments for localized PC while systemic endocrine therapies are standard-of-care for advanced or
metastatic PC. The molecular target of endocrine therapy is the androgen receptor (AR), a transcription factor
activated by the steroid hormones testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. Because PC cells require AR for
proliferation and survival, inhibiting testosterone production (with gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs
and/or abiraterone acetate) and using competitive AR antagonists to block testosterone actions (such as
enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide) are the cornerstones of endocrine therapy. Unfortunately,
endocrine therapy is not curative and the disease will inevitably progress to advanced castration-resistant PC
(CRPC). CRPC is a lethal disease stage for which no curative therapies exist. Our analysis of tumor
specimens from patients has shown that one of the most frequent alterations occurring in CRPC is structural
rearrangement of the AR gene. Our preliminary data show that AR gene rearrangements uncouple the AR
transcription factor from endocrine regulation and also from negative feedback regulation that occurs when
tumor suppressor genes like PTEN are lost. This uncoupling renders AR activity insensitive to endocrine
therapies and promotes CRPC. The long term goals of this project are to harness AR gene rearrangements as
biomarkers to guide more effective use of current and future CRPC therapeutics, and to develop novel
therapeutics that can overcome the effects of AR gene rearrangements. To achieve these goals, we will
develop new mouse models of CRPC progression that harbor AR gene rearrangements and PTEN loss, and
use these models to identify mechanisms by which AR gene rearrangements promote PC progression and
therapeutic resistance. These models will fill a long-standing void in the field: a lack of mouse models reflecting
clinically-relevant AR alterations. We will test the utility of these models for advancing CRPC research by
evaluating CRPC responses to AR-targeted therapeutics in a whole-organism context. We will also use third-
generation genome structural variation analysis techniques to interrogate the structure of certain AR gene
rearrangements that occur via complex, multi-step mechanisms. This work is expected to provide clarity about
the role and origin of the most frequent and complex patterns of AR gene rearrangements in CRPC. Finally,
therapeutic vulnerabilities of CRPC models harboring AR gene rearrangements will be evaluated using a set of
candidate AR-targeted therapeutics. We will also use computational methods to nominate non-AR-targeted
therapeutics that will have efficacy in CRPC tumors harboring AR gene rearrangements. Collectively, this work
is expected to enhance understanding of AR gene rearrangements in CRPC progression, and yield new
models, biomarkers, and therapeutics that can be used to combat this lethal subset of the disease."
10875537,"Overall Component: Project Summary/Abstract
Persistent poverty environments impose particular challenges for cancer prevention, with complex and
intersecting factors creating barriers at the individual, health system, and population level. Improving cancer
outcomes in these areas requires transformational, multisector solutions targeting fundamental causes and
social determinants of health, with research and policy development processes that are co-created with the
impacted communities. To address this challenge, we will form the UPSTREAM Research Center, an
innovative approach to the fundamental problem of income deprivation by leveraging state programs for
Guaranteed Basic Income and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). Our team science approach to this
problem is supported by the unparalleled resources at Stanford University, the University of California, San
Francisco and the University of California, Davis. Our work advances multiple conceptual and methodological
innovations through two main research projects: 1) an ongoing partnership with the California Department of
Social Services to access and evaluate a $35M intervention of Guaranteed Basic Income in persistent poverty
areas with a focus on modifiable cancer risk factors and intermediate outcomes; 2) the impact of increases in
income support through the EITC, which in California has a unique focus on lower income wage earners, as
well as undocumented workers. Our Specific Aims are to: Aim 1. Build a collaborative community of residents
in persistent poverty areas, policy makers, trainees, cancer and social science researchers and data scientists
that co-create programs to address the fundamental impacts of income deprivation, Aim 2. Evaluate the
impact of income-based interventions in demographically diverse persistent poverty areas in Northern CA, Aim
3. Develop a mathematical model, with community input, that can assist in predicting long-term impacts of
income-focused interventions on cancer incidence, providing community members, policy makers, and
researchers with guidance on how best to eliminate the increased burden of cancer in persistent poverty areas,
Aim 4. Develop and implement a career enhancement program that will facilitate the training and career
development of a diverse cadre of interdisciplinary early-career scholars who are committed to advancing
cancer health equity through research and practice in persistent poverty areas, and Aim 5. Implement
innovative and collaborative cancer prevention and control programs identified through the UPSTREAM
Research Center research projects and our community partners to develop long-term sustainable strategies in
our Northern CA Catchment Areas and across the Persistent Poverty Centers Network. Results from this novel
groundbreaking work will lay the foundation for transformative approaches to address cancer prevention and
control programs in the face of severe economic and social disadvantage through capacity building and
sustainable partnerships with policymakers, state and local agencies and community partners."
10875538,"Administrative Core: Project Summary
The overarching goal of the UPSTREAM Research Center Administrative Core is to provide the administrative
support necessary to direct research activities through a cohesive, integrated, and efficient Center that will
serve as a critical hub and resource for participating institutions, community partners, and the national network
of persistent poverty centers. The Administrative Core will bring together a coalition with unparalleled
resources and reach, and coordinate activities across multiple institutional and community partners:
the Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Stanford University, the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
and the University of California, Davis (UCD); The UCD Center for Advancing Cancer Health Equity; The
Stanford Center for Poverty and Inequality; Stanford Basic Income Lab; state and local governments; and
community-based organizations. The Administrative Core will help build research capacity in areas of
persistent poverty, support community-engaged research and develop capacity for implementing multi-level
and multi-factorial cancer prevention and control interventions that include basic income interventions. As the
hub for the management and coordination of all Center activities, the Administrative Core will create synergy
within the Center and across the national network of persistent poverty centers. We will maximize efficiency,
cost-effectiveness, and productivity by centralizing common administrative and operational resources. The
goals of the center and the means of achieving those goals will be guided by a Regional Coalition of
Community Partners who will play an active role in the functioning of the administrative Core and the overall
center. Dr. Melissa Bondy, Professor and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Population Health at
Stanford University and Associate Director for Population Health at the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) will lead
the Administrative Core, supported by Dr. David Rehkopf (Stanford), Dr. David Grusky (Stanford), Dr. Robert
A. Hiatt (UCSF), and Dr. Luis G. Carvajal-Carmona (UCD), and Project and Core leaders, and the regional
coalition on a Center Executive Committee (EC). The Administrative Core will convene weekly meetings,
monthly full meetings, monthly Executive Committee meetings, and an annual retreat to foster collaboration
and synergy. Day-to-day operations of the Administrative Core will be overseen by a dedicated Center
Manager. The Administrative Core has the following Specific Aims: 1) Provide administrative leadership and
integration of Projects and Cores across the proposed Center 2) Convene internal and external advisory board
meetings and facilitate meaningful interactions between advisory boards, Center members, the regional
coalition of community partners and other persistent poverty centers. 3) Develop a diverse, transdisciplinary
research workforce. 4) Build research capacity in persistent poverty areas and provide infrastructure for
collaborative studies with community partners. 5) Establish practices to monitor Project productivity and assess
use of Core resources. 6) Coordinate and implement broad results dissemination."
10875540,"Research and Methods Core: Project Summary
The focus of our proposed UPSTREAM Research Center is examining the impacts of income intervention
programs for reducing the long-term burden of cancer in persistent poverty areas. Our proposal to achieve this
is through a scientific and collaborative process that prioritizes both the overlapping and also distinct needs of
the Latino and Vietnamese communities in the persistent poverty areas of Santa Clara County and Yolo
County, CA. The rationale for this approach is that there is robust evidence supporting a fundamental causes
approach to cancer prevention – that is, only through intervening on the “causes of the causes” will we make
substantial progress in reducing the cancer burden in persistent poverty areas. We cannot rely solely on
individual or group behavioral change interventions alone for population reductions in the cancer burden; we
must move ‘upstream’. The Research & Methods Core will support this mission through: Aim 1. Coordinating
data collection, measures and methods and ensuring the interoperability of both quantitative and qualitative
data within the Center and between Centers, Aim 2. Modeling the long-term effects of the project interventions
and other exposures on colorectal cancer incidence, Aim 3. Coordinating with the projects and Cores to create
data dashboards and insights with the persistent poverty communities in ways that will most benefit community
led actions in cancer prevention, Aim 4. Evaluating the Center’s research productivity and impact over the
funding period. The Research and Methods Core will address the needs of the Research projects by
coordinating the collection of similar measures across research projects to enable inference as to the relative
value of different income intervention programs, working with project investigators to coordinate
methodological approaches for inference, and coordinating with project investigators to use estimates from
their analytic data based models for inputs to a mathematical model that will predict population level changes
in colorectal cancer incidence in persistent poverty areas. Across all of the above processes, the Research &
Methods Core will evaluate the Center’s research productivity and impact over the funding period as part of the
leadership team aims outlined in the Administrative Core. The mission of the Research and Methods Core is
driven by two intertwining areas of intended impact – 1) robust and reproducible scientific discovery on the
impact of income interventions on preventing cancer in persistent poverty areas in combination with 2) building
capacity for cancer prevention research in those areas. Our team sees these as inseparable objectives.
Despite the compelling evidence for the impact of addressing social determinants of health as fundamental
causes of disease, less of this work has been based on actual interventions and actions, and even less of this
work in relation to cancer incidence. To build capacity for prevention in persistent poverty areas, this scientific
research needs to be co-produced with these communities in order to have the greatest impact, and the
Research & Methods Core will play a part in this mission of our Center."
10875542,"Research Project 1: Project Summary
The fundamental cause framework treats socioeconomic status as a master cause that lies behind the many
intermediary causes of cancer (e.g., behaviors and attitudes, access to preventative services, access to and
quality of care). This framework, although immensely influential, has mainly served as a scholarly school of
thought rather than a programmatic approach around which concrete cancer-prevention work has been built.
We aim to carry out the research needed to determine whether an upstream “fundamental cause” program
could be a cost-effective component of our country’s cancer-prevention policy. We focus on income not just
because it’s readily manipulated but also because it’s likely to be a consequential manipulation. The best
available evidence suggests that the key intermediary determinants of cancer (e.g., diet, tobacco use, excess
body weight, stress, health care quality) are likely to be quite responsive to increases in income. This novel
project proposed is a unique opportunity to build out this evidence base by collaborating with the California
Department of Social Services (CDSS) on the state’s $35 million guaranteed income pilots. These pilots will be
used to deliver a randomized field experiment on the effects of income on presumed intermediary determinants
of cancer. The overall objective of this project is to examine the effects of income on these intermediary
factors, and to assess whether guaranteed income could be a cost-effective intervention. This project will
address this through these Specific Aims: Aim 1: Estimate the causal effects of guaranteed income on
modifiable cancer risk factors using California’s Guaranteed Income Pilots (GIPs), Aim 2: Estimate the effects
of guaranteed income on key types of cancer by combining short-term outcomes into a surrogate index that
equals the predicted value of long-term cancer rates, and Aim 3: Develop a comprehensive fundamental cause
approach to reducing cancer that combines income supplementation with conventional services. We will
conduct follow-up interviews and preliminary tests to begin developing new approaches to combining income
supplementation with conventional services. This project focuses on a novel approach to evaluate income as a
fundamental cause, whereas our second proposed project of the UPSTREAM Research Center broadens the
assessment to include income and employment (by evaluating the EITC). Because the two projects will share
measures and methods (with coordination via the Research & Methods Core), it will be possible to compare
across our two formulations of a fundamental cause approach. These two projects, taken together, will also
allow us to train a new cadre of scholars on upstream community-informed interventions in persistent poverty
census tracts."
10875545,"Research Project 2: Project Summary
Despite some successes of individual-level programs and interventions to promote behaviors that prevent
colorectal cancer – the burden in persistent poverty areas remains particularly high. Many experts in cancer
prevention and control have recently argued that to truly address this inequitable burden we must take a multi-
level approach that includes addressing the fundamental causes of cancer. We propose a quasi-experimental
study of the impacts of the largest anti-poverty policy program for families in the U.S. -- the Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC), with a particular focus on local persistent poverty areas in two counties in California: 1) Yolo, a
largely agricultural county which is home to University of California, Davis (UCD), and the county with the
highest poverty rate in California; and 2) Santa Clara, an urban area home to Stanford University, with
dramatic income inequality. Since 2015, for households earning up to $30,000 per year, the California EITC
(CalEITC) and Federal Credits provide up to $10,000 a year. This amount of income, through helping pay for
daily expenses, food and housing, transportation, and healthcare, and therefore also by reducing the stress of
poverty, may influence several risk factors for colorectal cancer. Also notable is the change in eligibility for
CalEITC that occurred in California in 2020 – having a social security number is no longer required, opening
eligibility to non-U.S. citizens with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). We will work with our
Regional Coalition of community partners to accomplish the following specific aims: Aim 1. Examine the impact
of the California 2015 EITC expansion (CalEITC) on colorectal cancer risk factors and preventative screening,
Aim 2. Estimate the short-term effects of CalEITC on colorectal cancer risk factors and screening among
Californians living in persistent-poverty areas, Aim 3. Qualitatively examine 3.1) CalEITC recipients’ experience
to understand the impacts of CalEITC on behaviors and exposures related to colorectal cancer prevention, and
3.2) non-EITC recipients who qualify to understand the reasons for not applying for CalEITC benefits,
especially among newly eligible ITIN recipients in the Latino and Vietnamese communities in Yolo and Santa
Clara Counties, and Aim 4. Work with our Regional Coalition to build capacity in support of multilevel and
structural interventions by estimating the effects of EITC expansion on reducing colorectal cancer incidence
rates in persistent poverty areas. The project will build on the multiple institution and multi-disciplinary
collaborations of the UPSTREAM Research Center to address the most pressing needs for cancer prevention
in persistent poverty areas in Yolo and Santa Clara Counties, focusing on the needs of Latino and Vietnamese
people in these communities through our ongoing Regional Coalition community collaborations. Through the
case of the CalEITC, in coordination with the evaluation of Guaranteed Basic Income in Project 1, we expect
that our program will add evidence to support advocacy and actions to address the structural and social
determinants of health to promote colorectal cancer prevention and screening."
10875549,"CAREER ENHANCEMENT CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The UPSTREAM Research Center Career Enhancement Core will facilitate the training and career
development of a diverse cadre of interdisciplinary early-career scholars who are committed to advancing
cancer health equity through research and practice in persistent poverty areas. Leveraging the outstanding
training environment of Stanford, UCSF and UC Davis, we propose to implement the UPSTREAM Scholars
Training Program. The UPSTREAM Scholars Training Program will recruit, select, and train postdoctoral
scholars pursuing independent academic careers in cancer health disparities research. Our proposed career
development program has five pillars: 1) mentored research experience with a mentoring team composed of
Center faculty across institutions and Regional Coalition members; 2) didactic educational program with
curriculum in community engagement; health equity, and the social determinants of cancer; 3) experience
conducting community-led research; 4) career and professional development activities; and 5) vertical and
peer networking within the UPSTREAM Research Center and across the Persistent Poverty Initiative Network.
To complement the in-depth training of postdoctoral scholars proposed under Aim 1 and extend the reach of
the Core, the Career Enhancement Core will offer an intensive short course on the social determinants of
cancer, a new course on leveraging real-world data to reduce cancer disparities in persistent poverty areas,
expert consultations with members of our Regional Coalition, a monthly UPSTREAM Research Center seminar
series, and a cancer health disparities journal club. These activities are designed to be widely accessible to
trainees from diverse career stages within the UPSTREAM Research Center and across the Persistent Poverty
Initiative Network. The Career Enhancement Core will synergize and coordinate with each component of the
UPSTREAM Research Center and further the overall center goal of alleviating cancer health disparities in
communities living in persistent poverty."
10875551,"DEVELOPMENTAL CORE: ABSTRACT
The Developmental Core of the UPSTREAM Research Center will foster innovative and collaborative
research related to the impact of cancer prevention and control in communities with persistent poverty. The
Core will play a key role in advancing the mission of the Center by stimulating novel research directions toward
the upstream fundamental causes of cancer, facilitating transdisciplinary collaboration across Center activities.
The Developmental Core will capitalize on the breadth and depth of research expertise at the intersection of
poverty and cancer at the three Comprehensive Cancer Centers in Northern California: Stanford, the University
of California at San Francisco (UCSF), and the University of California at Davis (UCD). Funded projects will
synergize with, and extend the research performed under Projects 1 and 2, and the Research and Methods
Core. We propose to fund pilot projects in three complementary research tracks: 1) Supporting
community prioritized interventions and projects related to income support and cancer equity, 2) Elucidating
mechanisms linking lack of income to drivers of cancer inequities, and 3) Facilitating collaborative
transdisciplinary projects between early career scholars, clinicians, and community partners. Funds will be
used by investigators and community partners to develop pilot data that will serve as the basis for obtaining
subsequent research funding through external peer-reviewed grants. We will work collaboratively with our
community partners, the Persistent Poverty Initiative Network, and the Network Steering Committee. Aim 1 of
the Core is to administer and support 3 pilot projects per year to catalyze innovative and collaborative research
related to the impact of GBI and EITC programs on cancer prevention and control in our selected communities
with persistent poverty. Aim 2 of the Core is to build capacity for sustainable bi-directional partnerships
between university and community partners to reduce cancer inequalities in persistent poverty areas through
community-driven research. The sustainable products of the Developmental Core activities will be the creation
of novel avenues for collaborative research on the social determinants of cancer in persistent poverty
communities, broad transdisciplinary participation in Center activities, and the career development of pilot
project awardees committed to a focus on research in persistent poverty areas of Northern California."

these studies including that most of them were observational and non-randomized, included small sample sizes,
or focused on hostility, non-physical aggression, or self-harm, rather than violent acts. Further, the majority of
these trials were not generalizable to outpatient, community settings. No large effectiveness study has

with clozapine vs. treatment as usual (TAU) on the risk of violent acts in 280 individuals with schizophrenia at

including positive symptoms, psychopathy, impulsivity, and substance use, evidence suggests that the final
common pathway for many of these disparate causal influences likely runs through behaviors captured by the
Excitement Factor of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (i.e., a composite of the scores of excitement,
uncooperativeness, poor impulse control, and hostility). Importantly, our target (the excitement factor of the
PANSS) has been validated to measure excitement-like symptoms in clinical trials in schizophrenia, is sensitive
to treatment, has been linked to the neurobiology of violence in spectroscopy and PET studies, and
differentiates clozapine from other antipsychotic drugs. We will also explore the effects of clozapine vs. TAU on
positive symptoms (e.g., persecutory delusions) and alcohol and substance use, and how these effects
influence the risk for violent acts. To enhance the safe implementation of this study in this vulnerable population
at risk of violent behaviors, we will implement clinical safety and treatment engagement protocols that rely upon
standard personnel and that will be readily generalizable. This trial will provide guidance on the use of clozapine

10874744,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Circuits in the healthy central nervous system (CNS) have the capacity for reorganization and remapping of
functionality. Growing evidence suggests that circuit remapping may contribute to a number of neurologic
diseases as well. For example, it has been widely hypothesized that remapping of circuits underlies recovery
after a focal lesion of the CNS, such as stroke. However, how specific changes in neuronal circuits mediate
improvement in function and recovery after cortical injury remains a major gap in our understanding. Here, Dr.
Zeiger will utilize advanced techniques for imaging and manipulating circuits in vivo to define the local and global
changes in neural circuits that occur following a lesion of the somatosensory cortex in mice. In Aim 1, Dr. Zeiger
will investigate the role of GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) cells in peri-lesional remapping of somatosensory
function after small lesions to the cortex. PV cells shape cortical sensory representations and regulate
experience-dependent plasticity. Dr. Zeiger hypothesizes that PV cells in peri-lesional cortex play a critical role
in functional remapping. He will test this hypothesis by 1) recording sensory-evoked responses from PV and
pyramidal cells throughout recovery using in vivo two-photon (2P) calcium imaging and 2) modulating PV cell
activity using DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) and measuring the
effects on circuit remapping. In Aim 2, Dr. Zeiger will identify novel candidate brain regions for remapping of lost
functionalities that mediate behavioral recovery after large cortical lesions. He hypothesizes that remapping after
large lesions involves distributed networks of neurons across multiple brain regions. He will test this by
generating a quantitative atlas of all remapped whisker-responsive neurons following recovery, allowing
identification of novel candidate regions important for remapping. He will then measure changes in circuit function
in these sites over time during recovery and confirm the roles of these regions by manipulating neuronal activity
with DREADDs and testing the effect on recovery of somatosensory function.
Dr. Zeiger is currently an Assistant Professor in Neurology at the University of California – Los Angeles
(UCLA). His long-term career goal is to work as a physician-scientist investigating mechanisms of circuit
dysfunction contributing to neurologic disease. As part of this proposal he will carry out a detailed career
development plan focusing on gaining technical skills in advanced neuroscience methods for investigating
neuronal circuits, expanding his knowledge of how circuit dysfunction contributes to movement disorders, and
transitioning to an independent career. This work will be carried out at UCLA, a renowned research institution
with an extensive community of investigators in neuroscience and neurology and supported by numerous
institutional resources such as the UCLA Clinical and Translational Science Institute. Dr. Zeiger’s career
development will be guided by a team of mentors including his primary mentor Dr. Carlos Portera-Cailliau and
co-mentors Dr. Jeff Bronstein and Dr. S. Thomas Carmichael."
10824298,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe malaria due to infection by Plasmodium falciparum is a serious threat to global health with over
a million deaths per year. New antimalarial agents are needed due to widespread resistance to existing
therapies. A promising antimalarial drug target is the MEP pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, which
is not found in humans. We have used forward genetic screening to identify malaria parasites resistant
to MEP pathway inhibition. We have thus identified a new family of metabolic regulators in malaria, the
HAD proteins. We now propose to determine the mechanism by which loss of HAD phosphatases
confers drug resistance (Aim 1); establish the biological functions of HADs in parasite development
(Aim 2); and use a new MEP pathway inhibitor to identify and characterize additional mechanisms of
resistance (Aim 3). We will identify P. falciparum genes and pathways that genetically interact with the
essential MEP pathway and our strong preliminary results support this approach. In addition, our results
will inform our understanding of the basic biology of the HAD family of metabolic regulators and will
determine whether HAD-mediated drug resistance can be transmitted."
10842411,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Virus infections are highly associated with the exacerbation of allergic diseases including allergic asthma,
atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. IgE-mediated allergic sensitization has been shown to impair antiviral
responses by innate immune cells such as monocytes- enhancing pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion,
disrupting phagocytosis, and inhibiting virus-induced maturation, IFN production, and altering CD4 T cell priming.
These findings suggest a role for IgE-mediated signals in modulating innate antiviral signaling pathways,
however little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms behind these observations. Given the significant
morbidity and economic impact of allergic diseases, a thorough understanding of IgE-mediated effects on
antiviral responses is critical for the discovery of new therapeutics for viral and allergic diseases. The goal of this
study is to determine how IgE-mediated allergic stimulation inhibits monocyte antiviral responses to regulate
cellular functions. Using primary human monocytes, we will utilize established molecular and biochemical
techniques in combination with advanced flow cytometry techniques (flow cytometry imaging and mass
cytometry) and transcriptomics to: (Aim 1) determine how IgE-mediated signaling components regulate early
antiviral recognition pathways, (Aim 2) determine the mechanisms by which IgE-induced IL-10 regulates
interferon receptor signaling, and (Aim 3) translate the in vitro findings by comparing monocyte antiviral
responses in individuals with high and low serum IgE. These studies will fill a large gap in our current knowledge
of how IgE-mediated processes modulate antiviral responses to promote virus-induced allergic exacerbations.

infectious disease specialist trained in both human immunology and virology to establish a scientific platform to
answer a breadth of questions involving host-pathogen interactions in the context of human disease. Her
innovative approaches have the potential to identify new therapeutics to treat virus-induced allergic diseases,

10850831,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This T32 training grant renewal application is to support the training of 6 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral
trainees in Immunology. Training is to be performed at 3 institutions: The University of Colorado Anschutz
Medical Campus (UCD-AMC), the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes (BDC; at AMC), and National
Jewish Health (NJH). All training faculty are primary or secondary members of the UC-AMC Department of
Immunology & Microbiology. There are 43 faculty trainers and similar in number to our last renewal application
in 2015. This cohort of faculty provide expertise in both basic, human and translational immunology.
 The grant will be directed by two Program Directors, Dr. Raul Torres and Dr. Ross Kedl, whose
laboratories are both located at UC-AMC. This arrangement is to ensure appropriate attention is directed to
both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. Dr. Torres is a well-known B cell biologist who has had continuous
NIH funding for over 20 years and has successfully trained a number of graduate students that have gone on
to secure positions as faculty, in biotech, journal editor and strong academic postdoctoral positions. He has
been the PI on this T32 for the previous 5 years. Dr. Kedl has successfully trained a number of predoctoral and
postdoctoral fellows that also currently occupy (tenure-track) faculty and biotech positions. He was the
Associate Director of the Ph.D. training program in immunology at UC-AMC for almost 10 years and is well
known for his work on T cells. Responsibility for various aspects of the Training Grant will be shared by these
two PDs as described in the Multiple PD Leadership Plan.
 Trainees will be selected for support by the Program Steering Committee after application by trainee
and mentor. Selection will be based on the merit of their previous work and their proposal for future research
and appointments will typically be for 2 years. Trainees are required to take Responsible Conduct in Research
every 4 years, to attend and present in our weekly “Research in Progress” forum and to complete each year an
Individual Development Plan that is discussed with their mentor. Evaluation of progress of research and
advice about career direction will be provided for predoctoral students by their Thesis Committee and for
postdoctoral fellows by a mentoring committee consisting of at least 3 faculty members, chosen by the fellow.
Predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees must meet their committees at least once every 6 months, and the
committees must submit written reports describing the meetings.
 This Training Grant has a long and distinguished record, with almost all of its trainees going on to
successful careers as scientists, ranging from academia to public service at NIH or the CDC to research in
Biotech or with big Pharmaceutical companies. Particularly notable is its continued successful recruitment and
training of a number of underrepresented minorities. The Program continues to be a major focus for
immunological research in the Rocky Mountain region in particular and the USA in general."
10854855,"SUMMARY
 Immunglobulin µ (IgM) is an evolutionary old class of antibody that is the first antibody
produced in response to an infection. Several IgMs are present as natural antibodies and are vital
for immunity during the early stages of development. Unlike any other class of antibody, a single
copy is sufficient for activating the classical complement system, and several monoclonal IgMs
have shown massive potential for the treatment of cancers. The large size, high degree of
glycosylation, and structural heterogeneity of IgM has rendered them refractory to structural
studies and to date the molecular mechanisms of how antigen binding activates IgM to initiate the
complement cascade remain murky. In contrast, a detailed understanding of the structure and
various interactions of immunoglobulin g (IgG) have been fundamental to their advancement as
the premier molecular platform for biotherapeutics. Accordingly, a similar level of understanding
of IgM will be critical for their development as a new class of biotherapeutics.
 This proposal aims to apply structural mass spectrometry techniques, electron microscopy
with complementary structural approaches, and biophysical tools to study the structural changes
within IgM that govern activation of the complement cascade. Various types of IgM-antigen
complexes will be prepared and analyzed using hydrogen/deuterium exchange and X-ray foot
printing with mass spectrometry to track the local structural changes within IgM upon binding
different presentations of antigen (Aim 1). Electron microscopy and small angle X-ray scattering
will be used to visualize and track large-scale structural transitions in the antigen-IgM complexes
(Aim 2). The full combination of techniques will be used to study how IgM recruits and activates
the initial component, C1, of the complement cascade (Aim 3). The molecular mechanisms of
how IgM recognizes antigen and recruits complement will provide a foundation for modulating the
immune system for a new paradigm in biotherapeutics."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) includes mucosal squamous cell carcinomas of the oral
cavity, pharynx, and larynx. It represents over 65,000 new cancer cases, with 14,500 cancer-related deaths in

ceramide synthase 1 (CerS1)-generated C18-ceramide, a bioactive sphingolipid with anti-proliferative signaling
functions. Lower ceramide levels are associated with advanced disease stage and poor survival in HNSCC
patients with defective mitophagy. Our preliminary data showed that the reconstitution of C18-ceramide synthesis
in mitochondria by CerS1 restored mitophagy and HNSCC tumor suppression. Recently, we discovered that
instead of trafficking C18-ceramide, its metabolic enzyme, CerS1, is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) to damaged mitochondria, a paradigm-shifting mechanism, to induce mitophagy in response to cisplatin,
rapamycin or sodium selenite (SoSe)-mediated stress signaling. A previously unidentified 17 kDA protein
catalyzes this process. We coined its name as p17/PERMIT (protein ER-mitochondrial transporter). However,
mechanisms that regulate CerS1-p17/PERMIT and subsequent ceramide-dependent mitophagy and cell death
in HNSCC remain unknown. Accordingly, to restore ceramide accumulation in mitochondria, we developed a
novel ceramide analog drug, LCL768. This ceramide analog contains C18-ceramide, conjugated with selenium
and pyridinium moieties, which target C18-ceramide selectively to HNSCC cell mitochondria, leading to
mitophagy induction. Thus, our preliminary data suggested to us the novel hypothesis that mitochondrial
trafficking of CerS1 by p17/PERMIT mediates ceramide-dependent mitophagy, leading to HNSCC tumor
suppression in response to cancer therapeutics and stress signaling. As a corollary, we also hypothesize that
LCL768 reconstitutes mitochondrial ceramide and mitophagy in HNSCC with defective mitochondrial CerS1-
p17/PERMIT trafficking. To test these hypotheses, we propose three Specific Aims: 1) Determine the mechanism
whereby p17/PERMIT-mediated trafficking of CerS1 to mitochondria induces C18-ceramide generation and
mitophagy. 2) Define the mechanisms by which mitochondrial CerS1/C18-ceramide mediates mitophagy via
Drp1 activation. 3) Identify the therapeutic mechanisms and efficacy of mitochondria-targeted ceramide-analog
drug, LCL768, in HNSCC tumor suppression. Our research team, which includes both basic and clinical
scientists, is uniquely positioned to execute studies proposed in this application based on our complementary
expertise in the fields of sphingolipid metabolism, mitochondrial damage signaling, mechanisms of cancer cell
death, and HNSCC therapy. In addition to ceramide analogs (such as LCL768), we propose experiments here
using clinically available therapeutic drugs, such as SoSe, rapamycin and cisplatin in patient-derived 2D HNSCC
organoids and PDX tumors, which can readily be translated into the clinic to induce ceramide-dependent
mitophagy and tumor suppression in HNSCC."
10854899,"Summary: Mass spectrometry (MS) has proven invaluable in studying the mechanisms of cellular
signaling as MS platforms can directly provide amino acid residue site-specific phosphorylation
data compared to traditional antibody-based approaches. However, limitations exist in current
MS approaches in generating confident site-specific phosphorylation quantification. This is
particularly evident in complex multi-phosphorylated protein motifs, where the detection of
isomeric multi-phosphorylated peptides easily overwhelms any prediction scoring approach that
is simply based upon the fragmentation spectra. There are many biological examples of
hyperphosphorylated regions, where they are associated with receptor/ligand interactions,
including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), membrane receptors that are the most common
targets for FDA-approved drugs. For accurate site-specific quantification of protein
hyperphosphorylation we propose a transdisciplinary approach using ultrahigh resolution Ion
Mobility Separation (IMS) integrated with highly accurate and sensitive MS and MS/MS spectra
to enable the confident characterization of hyperphosphorylated GPCR ensembles with greatly
improved sensitivity, and speed. We will use multi-level Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations
(SLIM) technology (SLIM-Orbitrap platform) to fully characterize phosphorylation of
GPCR/antagonist interactions utilizing CXCR3, which plays a central role in inflammatory
diseases through its regulation of T cell function as an initial test case. We plan to first integrate
ultrahigh resolution IMS with an advanced Orbitrap MS platform for unambiguous decoding of
hyperphosphorylated sites, evaluate the SLIM-Orbitrap MS platform for resolving
hyperphosphorylated protein regions, and finally, perform comprehensive site-specific
phosphoproteomics for GPCRs through screening of activated T cells with dose-responses of
chemokine and small-molecule CXCR3 biased agonists."
10879148,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death. Increasing in prevalence, COPD
is a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information
about the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where
quantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study
has recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in
evaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different
scanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and
harmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners.
This goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical
phantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD
patients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not
fully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across
different scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed
radiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where
studies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable
and practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners.
Such models are currently lacking in the context of COPD.
We develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT
biomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the
first library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate
models of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT
cases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of
current and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms
(through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and
optimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the
algorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images
. We
then harmonize CT settings across different scanners to accurately and precisely assess COPD imaging
biomarkers for both single time-point and longitudinal studies.
The studies will be done for the top two image
processing algorithms, identified in the challenge, as well as our developed algorithm. Through these efforts,
the project will position CT as a more reliable method for improved characterization and monitoring of COPD."
10861865,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to establish personalized structural biology – a precision medicine approach for inter-
preting clinical sequencing data by jointly modeling all mutations in a patient’s proteome in the context of protein
3D structures, known human genetic variation, and other relevant data. In this project, we will develop the com-
putational tools needed to integrate the wealth of available genetic variation data with cutting edge algorithms
for efficiently modeling mutations to human protein structures and accurately quantifying their specific functional
effects. This will provide a rich characterization of healthy and diseased proteomes and the means to generate
actionable hypotheses about the effects of variants of unknown significance in individual patients. To demon-
strate the power and relevance of this approach, we will apply it to facilitate variant interpretation in individuals
in the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). We will then collaborate to validate our predictions.
 Our central hypothesis is that achieving the full promise of precision medicine requires the interpretation
of a patient’s genetic variants in their 3D structural contexts and the integration of structural and clinical infor-
mation. Patient genome interpretation is a major roadblock to fully realizing the transformative potential of per-
sonalized medicine in the clinic. Current approaches for characterizing protein-coding variants of unknown sig-
nificance have several shortcomings that limit their practical utility. First, they are not personalized; most are
trained en masse on databases of known mutations across thousands of individuals. Thus, they are subject to
ascertainment bias and ignore the background of other variants present in the individual. Second, most fail to
provide specific biologically interpretable and thus therapeutically actionable predictions of a mutation’s effects
beyond “benign” or “pathogenic”. Third, they are not stable and similar methods often disagree. Fourth, most are
unable to interpret multi-base insertions and deletions. As a result and most importantly, current methods often
give insufficient guidance to clinicians and fail to personalize next steps of treatment.
 Computational methods for modeling the effects of mutations on protein structures are now sufficiently
fast and accurate to provide a solution to these challenges. Building on our expertise in analyzing the effects of
mutations and modeling protein structures, the following aims establish a computational framework for interpre-
tation of exonic variants that is personalized, clinically relevant, accurate, and applicable to all mutation types."
10831010,"Declines in cognitive function and walking function are highly intertwined in older adults. For instance, lower
executive function exacerbates conversion to Alzheimer’s disease and is also associated with slow walking
speed, instability, and falling. In turn, low levels of walking activity are a risk factor for age-related cognitive
decline including Alzheimer’s disease. Combinatorial interventions that target both cognition and walking
function may break this vicious cycle. Prefrontal networks are a crucial intervention target due to their role in
executive function, which underlies performance of both complex cognitive tasks and complex walking tasks.
Our research targets prefrontal neuroplasticity using a potent behavioral intervention of complex (cognitively
engaging) aerobic walking exercise combined with frontal lobe transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS).
tDCS is a mild form of electrical brain stimulation which may be an effective adjuvant for enhancing the effects
of behavioral interventions on cognitive and motor function. The overarching hypothesis of our research is that
tDCS delivered over prefrontal regions during complex walking exercise can improve both executive function
and walking function. We have previously conducted a successful Phase 1 study that demonstrated feasibility,
safety, and positive behavioral outcomes from this intervention in older adults. Now we are proposing a Phase
2 study that is designed to establish initial efficacy, investigate mechanisms of intervention response, and to
develop a multi-site research infrastructure. We will enroll 104 older adult participants who have age-related
cognitive decline. All participants will undergo the same 18-session high intensity aerobic walking program,
which will emphasize the use of complex walking tasks that engage prefrontal cortex, such as obstacle
negotiation and walking on compliant surfaces. Participants will be randomly assigned to a tDCS treatment
group or sham control group. The treatment group will receive 20 minutes of 2mA tDCS over prefrontal regions
F3/F4. The sham control group will receive just 30 seconds of 2mA tDCS at F3/F4 at the beginning of the
session, which is known to be an effective sham procedure. A wearable stimulator will be used, so participants
can receive stimulation while simultaneously performing the complex walking exercise. Specific Aim 1 will
establish efficacy of prefrontal tDCS as an adjuvant to complex walking exercise for enhancing executive
function and walking function. Specific Aim 2 will investigate mechanisms of response, including task-based
prefrontal activity (with functional near infrared spectroscopy), MRI modeling of person-specific tDCS dosage,
and their association with behavioral outcomes. The deliverable for this line of research will be a clinically-
feasible multi-modal intervention for preserving function and independence in older adults."
10635900,"Background: Veteran suicide rates are 1.5 times higher than the general population rates and are especially
high following discharge from an inpatient mental health unit when up to a third of patients do not receive
timely outpatient follow-up care. Technology-based interventions are a scalable approach to provide additional
support to patients during these high-risk transitions. The Virtual Hope Box (VHB), a mobile phone application
(app) developed by the Department of Defense (DoD) and VA, allows patients to access reasons for living and
coping tools regardless of their location. VHB was effective for improving coping self-efficacy in a small
randomized controlled trial; however, no studies have been adequately powered to examine VHB’s
effectiveness for suicide attempts. Additionally, knowledge and use of the app is low according to a preliminary
study of mental health inpatients, calling for new strategies to facilitate greater use and impact of the VHB app.
Significance: The suicide rate among Veterans rose 35.9% from 2001 to 2019, leading to VA to make suicide
prevention a top clinical priority. We developed an intervention, which includes the VHB app and its enhanced
facilitation (VHB-EF), with the aim of reducing Veteran suicide attempts. Developing and implementing
effective strategies to reduce suicide attempts post-hospitalization is also a research priority within this RFA.
Innovation/Impact: We developed VHB-EF to provide awareness, active engagement, and support of VHB
with the aim of reducing suicide attempts post-hospitalization. This study will be the first to test the
effectiveness of VHB-EF on suicide attempts and may improve safety after discharge. It will examine potential
intervention mechanisms, according to self-efficacy theory and the theory of planned behavior, while also
considering ultimate implementation and scalability of the VHB-EF through provider and Veteran feedback.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the effectiveness of VHB-EF for reducing suicide attempts. Aim 2: Examine
the intervention mechanisms by measuring the effects of VHB-EF on 1) reasons for living, and 2) self-efficacy
to (a) cope and (b) refrain from suicide attempts. Exploratory Sub-aim 2: Examine whether higher reasons for
living and self-efficacy partially mediate the effect of VHB-EF on suicide attempts over 6 months. Aim 3:
Assess the determinants (barriers and facilitators) of VHB-EF adoption to inform future implementation and
sustainability of VHB-EF across the VA.
Methodology: A randomized effectiveness-implementation Hybrid Type I trial will be conducted at two VHA
inpatient mental health units. We will randomize 928 Veterans hospitalized after a suicidal crisis to either VHB-
EF or Enhanced Usual Care (EUC). The VHB-EF includes a single session on the unit that educates Veterans
on app purpose for suicide prevention, loads the app on their personal phone, provides practice of each app
component, and discusses strategies to enhance app usage after hospital discharge. It also includes a remote-
delivery phase which includes 2 phone calls after discharge to monitor risk, review/revise VHB content, and
support app use and outpatient treatment engagement. The EUC arm consists of reviewing a community
resources list. We will assess how VHB-EF (vs. EUC) impacts suicide attempts, as well as potential mediators,
across follow-up assessments (6 weeks and 3- and 6- months post-randomization). Qualitative interviews with
providers and Veterans will focus on barriers and facilitators of adoption.
Next Steps/Implementation: The VHB is already accessible in VA, but active intervention is needed to
engage high-risk suicidal Veterans, and additional effectiveness evidence is needed to support its
incorporation into treatment guidelines for suicide prevention. Through qualitative interviews we will examine
the determinants (barriers and facilitators) of VHB-EF adoption to inform future implementation and
sustainability of this approach across the VA. Broader implementation of the intervention will be coordinated
with Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention who supports the proposal."
10775793,"ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a deadly malignancy with limited treatment options. Signaling pathways
which promote HCC pathogenesis remain poorly defined. Activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade has
been demonstrated in multiple tumor types, including HCC. mTOR regulates cell growth and metabolism via the
formation of two multiprotein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. While mTORC1 has been extensively studied
in HCC, the functional contribution of mTORC2 during hepatocarcinogenesis is not well understood. mTORC2
functions by modulating AGC kinases, especially AKT kinases. AKT functions to regulate multiple pathways,
including FOXOs and TSC1/2 tumor suppressor genes. Our previous studies have shown that coexpression of
activated forms of AKT and Ras could cooperate to rapidly induce liver tumor development in mice. Recently,
we discovered that concomitant activation of Ras and loss of Tsc2 induced HCC formation in mice over long
latency. The results suggest additional signaling function downstream of AKT in HCC pathogenesis. FOXO1 is
a major downstream target of AKT, and its expression is strongly downregulated in human HCC samples.
However, whether loss of FOXO1 is able to promote HCC development, and how it interacts with TSC/mTORC1
to transduce signal downstream of mTORC2/AKT during HCC pathogenesis remains to be determined. Based
on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that TSC/mTORC1 and FOXO1 cascades have distinct roles in
mediating mTORC2/AKT signaling in HCC pathogenesis. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following
three aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the genetic crosstalk between FOXO1 and TSC tumor suppressors in
HCC. In Aim 2, we will define the functional roles of Tsc/mTORC1 and FoxO1 signaling cascades downstream
of mTORC2/Akt1 in c-Myc driven HCC. And in Aim 3, we plan to elucidate the signaling pathways downstream
of mTORC2/Akt during c-Met/β-catenin HCC pathogenesis. In summary, in this application, we will apply
innovative mouse genetic approaches in combination with in vitro experiments as well as human HCC sample
studies to delineate mTORC2/AKT, TSC/mTORC1 and FOXO1 signaling cascades during hepatic
carcinogenesis. The results will not only provide novel mechanistic insight into how deregulated signaling
pathways contribute to oncogene driven HCC development, but also will help pave the way for precision medicine
for HCC treatment."
10798238,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Schools face rising mental health needs among children that have been exacerbated by social isolation,
increased economic stress, and reduced societal supervision during the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. public
schools are the most common institutional entry point to mental health services for children, and school-based
health centers (SBHCs) increasingly serve as a “medical home” for vulnerable children. Yet there are
significant gaps in our understanding of SBHCs’ effectiveness and the extent to which they are reaching
underserved subgroups of children. Research on SBHCs has largely neglected the study of children’s mental
health outcomes; few studies have sought to study in-depth the mechanisms by which SBHC have the
potential to improve children’s outcomes; and we lack longitudinal research on SBHC effectiveness. We will fill
these critical gaps in research and generate new, generalizable knowledge on program and policy levers that
SBHCs can deploy to increase their effectiveness and reduce inequities in children’s health and education
outcomes. A key innovation of our proposed research is our use of a high-quality, linked health and education
dataset that encompasses the population of children in Tennessee who have a Medicaid record at any point in
time between 2006 and 2019, with the plan to add data through 2025. Our longitudinal data begin well before
the Affordable Care Act-funded expansion of SBHCs in Tennessee, allowing for a long baseline period before
the large majority of SBHCs opened. We will employ rigorous quasi-experimental methods with the linked
longitudinal data to compare children in schools that gained access to a SBHC with those in schools without
access to services provided by SBHCs and examine SBHC impacts on children’s mental health and
educational outcomes, including by subgroups of children of color, children of immigrants, children living in
rural areas, and those with specific health conditions. We will also advance our understanding of the
mechanisms by which SBHCs may improve children’s mental health and education outcomes by: 1)
elaborating and testing a child-centered conceptual framework for examining in-depth the organization and
implementation of SBHCs and factors that constrain or enable their effectiveness; 2) undertaking a
comprehensive documentation of the operations and services of traditional on-campus, school-linked, mobile,
and telehealth SBHCs and filling gaps in our understanding of how they are operating in rural areas and
through mobile/telehealth options, and 3) generating timely new information on how SBHCs adapted their
service delivery approaches during the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent to which disruptions in children’s
access to mental and behavioral health services disproportionately affected disadvantaged or underserved
subgroups of children. We will actively disseminate the study findings to ensure that they inform program
strategies, policies, and evaluation tools that state and local agencies can use to improve the efficacy of
SBHCs in serving children most in need of mental health services."
10899773,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal will determine whether increasing striatal cholinergic interneuron (ChI) activity in the developing
mouse brain can prevent dystonia following neonatal brain injury
. Dystonic cerebral palsy (CP) due to neonatal
brain injury is the most common cause of childhood dystonia and is often medically refractory and functionally
debilitating. Yet, its unique pathophysiology remains understudied. Dystonia pathophysiology is more commonly
studied in models of rare genetic dystonias which are characterized by striatal ChI hyperexcitability. However,
anticholinergic medications are often ineffective for treating dystonia in CP. Determining whether there is striatal
cholinergic pathology specific to dystonic CP could yield better targeted treatments. To this end, I have developed
a clinically-relevant rodent model of neonatal hypoxic brain injury that displays electrophysiologic markers of
dystonia three weeks after injury, mimicking the clinical latency period between neonatal brain injury and dystonia
emergence. This latency period allows testing of pre-symptomatic interventions for dystonia prevention. My
preliminary data demonstrate increased striatal ChI number in my model but that striatal ChI excitation in young
mice during the pre-symptomatic window may be protective against dystonia. In sum, these data suggest that
increased striatal ChI number and striatal ChI hyperexcitability may be compensatory mechanisms that are
protective against dystonia and, therefore, could be enhanced to prevent dystonia following neonatal brain injury.
To test this hypothesis, I propose the following aims: (1) determine whether chemogenetic modulation of striatal
ChI activity in young mice after neonatal brain injury changes dystonia severity in adult mice; (2) determine
whether chemogenetic modulation of striatal ChI activity in young, otherwise healthy, mice can cause dystonia
in adult mice; and (3) determine whether the striatal ChI hyperexcitability observed in genetic dystonias is also
present in my model of dystonia following neonatal brain injury. These studies will determine whether pre-
symptomatically increasing striatal ChI firing after neonatal brain injury could reduce or prevent dystonia.
My long-term career goal is to run a translational research lab focused on preventative treatment development
for dystonic CP. I have studied basal ganglia pathophysiology for ten years and have developed a new model of
dystonia following neonatal brain injury which will be used for the proposed experiments. However, to complete
the proposed research and facilitate my transition to independence, I need additional mentored training in slice
electrophysiology (Dr. Steve Mennerick) and chemogenetics (Dr. Jordan McCall). As my physician-scientist
advisor, Dr. Joel Perlmutter will provide expertise in dystonia pathophysiology and ensure the translational
relevance of my research. The Washington University School of Medicine and Department of Neurology provide
a world-renowned research environment and a legacy of passionately and effectively supporting junior faculty.
In sum, my proposed research, mentorship team, training plan, and institutional environment pave my path to
independence and submission of an R01 on
identification of treatment targets
for dystonic CP."
10890596,"Care coordination services have been developed to provide safer and more effective care for patients who
have difficulty managing their healthcare. The role of care managers (CMs) working in care coordination is
intended to take a holistic view of patients and to improve healthcare system efficiency, yet there remain
several gaps in the efficiency of this work. CMs often struggle to find resources for their patients, particularly in
the realm of depression management. Resources are limited, waitlists for services are long, and many patients
are hesitant to seek mental health care. Our research group has developed a productive partnership with the
Ambulatory Care Coordination service at Northwestern Medicine – a large integrated delivery system of more
than 3,500 physicians, serving 1 million patients. Currently CMs, primarily nurses by training, provide remote
coordination services to patients who typically have multiple physical and mental health conditions. They report
abundant challenges in supporting patients with depression. A digital mental health intervention packaged
within a patient management system for depression would fill the need for depression management resources
and fit into CM work. The overarching aim of the proposed project is to adapt and implement a digital mental
health intervention to improve access to and coordination of mental health services in Ambulatory Care
Coordination. Specifically, this study aims to: 1) adapt a digital mental health platform and service model to
address implementation barriers within care coordination, 2) develop and subsequently optimize a
multicomponent implementation strategy, and 3) conduct a randomized rollout effectiveness-implementation
trial of the digital mental health platform and a sustainment pilot period in the 4 regional teams of the
Ambulatory Care Coordination service. Data gathered throughout this project will be used to develop an
implementation guide, capable of being used by other for healthcare systems as they expand their mental
health service offerings to provide holistic support for patients."
10840289,"ABSTRACT
HIV is reverse-transcribed and integrated into the DNA of host cells, resulting in persistent
infections that are difficult to clear. To date, there is no effective cure to clear the virus from HIV-
infected patients. We have shown an approach to eradicate HIV infections by selective elimination
of host cells harboring replication-competent HIV (SECH). The SECH treatment can clear HIV-1
in over 50% mice reconstituted with a human immune system, and in blood samples from HIV-1-
infected patients. SECH can clear HIV-infection not only in CD4 T cells, but also in macrophages
and microglia cells. Experiments are proposed to determine how to improve the efficacy and
safety for SECH in clearing HIV-infection in the macrophage lineage: 1) To improve the efficacy
and specificity in the killing of HIV-1-infected macrophages. We have found that increased viral
reactivation leads to improved viral clearance in humanized mice. We will identify drugs that show
greater potentials in virus reactivation that could lead to better HIV clearance. We will examine
the inflammatory potentials for IDB and alternative LRAs in macrophages, and determine what
inflammatory cytokines may need to be targeted; 2) To determine how to improve the efficacy
and safety in the clearance of HIV reservoir in the macrophage lineage in lymphoid organs and
in the brain of humanized mice. We will evaluate whether alternative agents can improve the
clearance of HIV-1 in humanized mice in vivo. We will also determine whether optimum SECH
regimens can induce limited and controllable inflammatory responses. Our proposed work will
provide novel insights into how targeting apoptosis and autophagy regulates the clearance of HIV
infection in the macrophage lineage. The studies will facilitate the development of SECH clear
HIV-1 infection in lymphoid organs and in the brain to achieve complete eradication of HIV-1."
10846855,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This is an initial submission of a K23 application by Dr. Christine Bakhoum, under the mentorship of Dr.
Joachim Ix at the UC San Diego. Through this proposal, Dr. Bakhoum intends to establish herself as an
independent investigator studying blood pressure (BP) patterns in pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Candidate: Dr. Bakhoum’s training objectives include; 1) become proficient in the research applications of
pediatric ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) data, 2) develop skills in advanced biostatistical
methods, 3) acquire expertise in pediatric clinical trial design and implementation, and 4) advance her
professional development. Dr. Bakhoum will accomplish these objectives through mentorship, coursework, and
participation in workshops and steering committees. She has assembled a multidisciplinary team of scientists
including her primary mentor Dr. Joachim Ix, an expert in clinical trials in CKD, Dr. Dena Rifkin, a leader in
hypertension and the application of ABPM, Dr. Adriana Tremoulet, a pediatric clinical trialist, and Dr. Ronit
Katz, a PhD level biostatistician who works closely with her mentoring team.
Research: A diagnosis of CKD in childhood portends high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality
in early adult life. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)
is critical. In adults, ABPM data demonstrates that loss of the physiologic decrease in BP at night compared to
daytime, or BP non-dipping, is associated with kidney function decline and CVD. While non-dipping is
prevalent in children with CKD, the definition of dipping in pediatrics is arbitrary and adopted from the adult
literature. Dr. Bakhoum’s preliminary work demonstrated that blunted nocturnal dipping may have adverse
consequences (i.e. proteinuria), that the thresholds for these consequences may be different for systolic vs.
diastolic BP, and that kidney sodium mishandling may play a role in the pathophysiology. She hypothesizes
that nocturnal BP change is, in part, caused by impaired daytime sodium excretion, and is a modifiable risk
factor for progression to ESKD in children with CKD. In Aim 1, Dr. Bakhoum will evaluate the association of
nocturnal BP patterns with risk of ESKD in the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study. In Aim 2, she
will recruit a cohort of 85 children with CKD and evaluate the association of the ratio of daytime to nighttime
sodium excretion with dipping patterns. Of this cohort, she will recruit 26 children with hypertension and non-
dipping who will continue to Aim 3. In Aim 3, she will conduct a randomized crossover study to test whether
nighttime administration of BP medications can restore nocturnal BP dipping in children with CKD. The results
of this proposal will provide a new framework for the interpretation of nocturnal BP in children with CKD and
will serve as a foundation for future clinical trials to investigate whether nighttime dosing of anti-hypertensive
medications can improve clinical outcomes in this population."
