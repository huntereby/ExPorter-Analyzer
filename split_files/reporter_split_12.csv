Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), the second most common form of
dementia, comprise a spectrum of fatal neurodegenerative diseases. An intronic GGGGCC (G4C2)
hexanucleotide repeat expansion (HRE) in the C9orf72 gene, have been linked to ALS and FTD, although
clinically two distinct diseases. The C9orf72 HRE is the most common cause of both familial and sporadic ALS
accounting for ~40% and ~8% of patients respectively. Overall, about 10% of ALS cases are familial with the
remaining 90% being sporadic. The molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis remain poorly
understood. Defects in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) and the nuclear pore complex (NPC) have recently
emerged as a prominent pathomechanism underlying multiple neurodegenerative diseases including C9orf72
ALS/FTD, subsets of sporadic ALS, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Huntington’s Disease. However, little is known
about the nature of the injury to the NPC and its individual nucleoporin components themselves. Using induced
pluripotent stem cell derived spinal neurons (iPSNs) and postmortem human tissue, we have amassed data
that loss of the transmembrane nucleoporin POM121 from NPCs initiates a pathological cascade impacting
NPC composition, function and downstream cellular survival. Notably, loss of POM121 is mediated by
pathologic G4C2 repeat RNA and not dipeptide repeat poly peptides or loss of C9ORF72 protein. Given that
POM121 protein is not mislocalized and POM121 RNA metabolism is unaltered, we hypothesized that
POM121 and subsequently altered nucleoporin proteins are aberrantly degraded in the early stages of C9orf72
ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Recent work in yeast and non-neuronal mammalian cells has shown that nuclear
CHMP7 “activates” ESCRT-III mediated degradation of nuclear pore complexes and nuclear envelope
components during nuclear pore surveillance and homeostasis. Our new preliminary data suggests that the
loss of POM121 from the nucleoplasm and NPCs is initiated by nuclear accumulation of CHMP7.
Mechanistically, increased nuclear CHMP7 appears to be the result of G4C2 repeat RNA mediated impaired
nuclear export. Thus, our data strongly implicate a CHMP7 degradative pathway in disease pathogenesis.
Intriguingly, knockdown of CHMP7 mitigates NPC injury in C9orf72 iPSNs making CHMP7 an attractive
therapeutic target in neurodegeneration. In this proposal we will comprehensively investigate this new pathway
including studies to 1) Determine the degradative pathway by which CHMP7 mediates nucleoporin removal
from NPCs in iPSNs, 2) Investigate the mechanism by which pathologic G4C2 repeat RNA initiates CHMP7
mediated NPC injury. And finally, 3) using a large battery of individual patient iPSN spinal neuron cell lines,
evaluate the ability of CHMP7 antisense oligonucleotides to mitigate C9orf72 ALS/FTD and sporadic ALS
mediated alterations in the nuclear pore complex and nucleocytoplasmic transport and downstream sensitivity
to stressors in iPSNs."

The proposed project examines the effects of pubertal suppression treatment on the mental health of
transgender adolescents over time. The physical changes brought on by puberty often amplify gender dysphoria
in transgender youth. Administering gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) is an effective means of
suppressing puberty to provide transgender youth, their families, and health care teams more time to consider
whether partially and/or fully irreversible treatments are indicated. Pubertal suppression is endorsed by the World
Professional Association for Transgender Health and the Endocrine Society as standard of care. Preliminary
reports suggest that treatment with GnRHa may confer mental health benefits for transgender youth. However,
GnRHa may also disrupt puberty-signaled neural maturation in ways that can undermine mental health gains
over time and impact quality of life in other ways. The overall impacts of GnRHa treatment have not been
systematically studied. In order to probe these effects, this project focuses on the assessment of dimensional
mental health and three neural systems that map onto the NIMH RDoC matrix: cognitive/emotional control, social
cognition, and reward responsiveness. Existing literature documents marked maturation in these systems during
normative adolescent development, and gonadal hormones are thought to contribute to this maturation. We will
take a multimodal approach, in which self- and parent-report, standardized neuropsychological assessments,
and neuroimaging methods are used to assess the effects of GnRHa treatment over a two-year study period.
We will enroll 132 transgender adolescents across three sites: Nationwide Children’s Hospital; Children’s
National Hospital; and Lurie Children’s Hospital. Half will be undergoing pubertal suppression with GnRHa and
the other half will be transgender youth not undergoing treatment. Evaluating the impact of GnRHa treatment on
mental health functioning as well as puberty-linked RDoC system maturation will clarify its potential protective
and risk effects to support optimization and personalization of treatment protocols."

Heart transplant (HTx) is a well-established life-saving procedure but is associated with severe complications.
Current clinical monitoring algorithms rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies
and catheter angiography. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed non-invasive comprehensive
cardiac MRI, which can quantify regional changes in myocardial tissue and function. Our efforts have focused
on the 2 major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (ACR), the leading cause of death in the first
year after transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality
beyond the first post-Tx year. Our cardiac MRI studies have identified new imaging biomarkers in HTx. We
were the first to establish a physiologic link between abnormal cardiac MRI measures and potential allograft
failure: myocardial T2 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as non-invasive tissue biomarkers for ACR. We
demonstrated that the natural history of myocardial scarring, T2, and ECV predicts adverse clinical events in
HTx recipients. In addition, our studies showed that donor and recipient mismatch (age, sex, weight, etc.) was
significantly associated with cardiac MRI-derived measures of myocardial edema/inflammation, fibrosis, and
systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Over the past five years, the PIs have assembled a unique study database
with over >450 comprehensive cardiac MRI exams comprising >110,000 annotated cardiac MRI images.
For this renewal application, we identified the need to conduct further long-term follow-up studies tailored to the
slow disease progression in HTx to identify changes over time in multiparametric MRI measures and predictors
of HTx outcome. Second, data on graft tissue and function in the pediatric HTx population are scarce and
improved strategies for donor-recipient matching in this vulnerable population are needed to make most
efficient use of the limited availability of donor hearts in children. Thus, cardiac MRI needs to better account for
age and sex related differences in patient habitus and physiology, critical for the wide age range in HTx from
pediatric to adult. The renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop multiparametric cardiac MRI for the
assessment of graft tissue (T2, T1, ECV), and dysfunction (myocardial velocities, strain) from pediatric to adult,
2) leverage the existing large cardiac MRI database (110,000 labeled cardiac MRI images) to establish deep
learning based analysis pipelines for automated cardiac MRI analysis with improved efficiency and reduced
inter-rater variability, 3) to identify predictors of adverse outcomes and to evaluate the impact of donor-recipient
mismatch on graft tissue, function, and flow in a prospective study with pediatric HTx patients, and 4) to identify
cardiac metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) HTx patient outcome by leveraging our HTx database (>145
HTx recipients with existing baseline cardiac MRI acquired during the initial funding cycle). Follow-up cardiac
MRI will provide unique insights in changes over time in graft tissue and function as mechanism underlying
different HTx patient trajectories (non-progression vs. late onset vs. slow progression vs. fast progression)."

 Despite the progress in molecular therapy and immunotherapy, multiple underlying cellular mechanisms
cause resistance to cancer therapy. There are urgent needs to develop innovative approaches to meet these
challenges. The proposed study is to develop subcellular enzyme-instructed self-assembly (sEISA), which
includes mitochondrial EISA (mitoEISA) and cytoplasmic EISA (cytoEISA), for generating molecular nanofibers
to overcome drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy. Our preliminary studies have shown
that sEISA selectively targets the mitochondria of cancer cells and minimizes drug resistance. Most importantly,
our preliminary study shows that sEISA inhibits the growth of immunosuppressive tumors in vivo. Thus, we
propose to further develop sEISA against drug resistant cancer cells and tumors. The proposed research has
three specific aims: Aim 1, developing mitoEISA for selectively targeting cancer cells; Aim 2, developing
cytoEISA for minimizing drug resistance and immunosuppression; and Aim 3, evaluating sEISA in ovarian
cancer xenograft murine models. The central hypothesis is that sEISA spatiotemporally generates molecular
nanofibers, which interact with multiple cellular proteins and interrupt multiple cellular processes inside cancer
cells to minimize drug resistance. Our preliminary results support the central hypothesis. The innovation is that
the mechanisms of the action of the molecular nanofibers significantly depart from the ligand-receptor dogma of
the current anticancer drugs. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to develop sEISA to generate molecular
nanofibers for overcoming resistance in cancer therapy. We anticipate that this research will provide innovative
anticancer approaches to address the problems of drug resistance and immunosuppression in cancer therapy,
thus ultimately will improve the survivorship of cancer patients."

Brain microvessels (BMVs) play an important role in the neurovascular coupling (NVC). Mitochondria are energy
sensors of cells and impaired mitochondrial respiratory function initiate critical signaling detrimental to NVC
leading to impaired cognitive function associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent technological
breakthrough utilizing Agilent Seahorse XFe extracellular flux analyzer developed a mitochondrial respiration
assay in BMVs. Using this novel method, we observed age-dependent impairment of mitochondrial respiration
and bioenergetics in BMVs from male and female C57Bl/6 mice. Notably, we found that BMVs from APP NL-G-F
Knock-in model of AD display impaired mitochondrial respiration and accelerated senescence. Furthermore, we
observed that young and aged female mice display sex-dependent differences in microvascular energetics
related to the relative contribution of oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis to overall energy production.
Finally, we found that peroxynitrite scavenger (FeTMPyP) treatment enhanced non-mitochondrial respiration
young female mice but enhanced proton leak in young male mice indicating that the differential peroxynitrite
activity is sex-dependent. Therefore, we hypothesize that peroxynitrite differentially regulates microvascular
mitochondrial function sex-dependently and is the molecular determinant of exaggerated age-related impairment
of NVC and cognitive function in AD. We will employ male and female AD and C57Bl/6 mice of 8 months and 20
months age. Aim 1 will determine the sex dependent differential impact of peroxynitrite on the bioenergetics and
enzyme activities (Krebs cycle, glycolysis, and antioxidants) in BMVs ex vivo. Aim 2 will determine the sex
dependent differential impact of peroxynitrite on in vivo NVC responses to whisker deflections by two-photon
excitation microscopy in awake mice. Aim 3 will determine the sex dependent differential impact of FeTMPyP on
cognitive function by assessing whisker-dependent perceptual learning using the novel texture discrimination
task. The results of this proposal would challenge the existing dogma and will demonstrate the sex-specific
physiological role of peroxynitrite in regulating the microvascular bioenergetics and neurovascular unit.
Furthermore, our results will firmly establish microvascular peroxynitrite as a potential therapeutic target in sex-
dependent vulnerability and severity of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases."

Despite being one of the largest and fastest-growing demographics in the United States (US), Latinx persons
experience striking health disparities, particularly in terms of hazardous drinking and co-occurring clinical
anxiety. No interventions to date have targeted hazardous drinking in the context of clinical anxiety among
Latinx persons. The current R01 proposal builds upon our past work by developing a brief, single-session,
computer-based, personalized feedback intervention (PFI) designed to enhance knowledge regarding adverse
anxiety-alcohol interrelations, increase motivation and intention to reduce hazardous drinking, and reduce
positive attitudes and intentions regarding the use of alcohol for anxiety. Specifically, we propose to develop a
low-cost, highly disseminatable, integrated PFI for Latinx hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety (AA-PFI 1.0)
that will be implemented and tested for effectiveness in community-based health clinics. Our approach will
follow a staged model consistent with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for developing and
standardizing behavioral interventions. Phase IA activities will involve collecting qualitative and quantitative
feedback from three iterative focus groups (N = 21) to refine intervention content and evaluate treatment
acceptability and feasibility. Phase IB activities will include a rigorous randomized clinical trial designed to
compare the effectiveness of AA-PFI 2.0 to a control PFI (C-PFI) among a sample of 250 Latinx hazardous
drinkers with clinical anxiety who receive care within community-based health clinics. This study represents an
important and pivotal step in the larger landscape of translating basic research to more efficacious strategies
for reducing hazardous drinking in underserved populations with biobehavioral comorbidities. The proposed
research project supports the 2017-2021 strategic plan of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism (NIAAA) by advancing research in two of the key areas. First, the current proposal has the end goal
of improving strategies to prevent alcohol misuse, alcohol use disorder, and alcohol-related consequences
among an ‘at-risk’ population for these conditions (goal 3). Second, it enhances the public health impact of
NIAAA-supported research by focusing on one of the fastest-growing and largest demographics in the US who
demonstrate disparities in hazardous drinking (goal 5). The current application aligns with the goals of RFA-
AA-21-001 by proposing to examine the effectiveness of a low cost, highly disseminatable, personalized,
culturally adapted PFI for Latinx hazardous drinkers with clinical anxiety within community-based health clinics.
Given the collective public health impact of concurrent anxiety and alcohol use, we believe the proposed study
will yield findings that enhance scientific knowledge, advance our understanding of mechanisms in anxiety-
alcohol use relations, and inform the development of novel treatments for hazardous drinkers with clinical
anxiety that are adaptable and easily implemented across a variety of healthcare settings."

10899709,"The purpose of this training and research application is to study the functional impact of mobile element insertions (MEIs) in neurological disorders (NDs) using new developments in deep learning techniques. MEIs are transposable DNA fragments that are able to insert throughout the human genome. There are at least 124 independent MEIs associated with human diseases. Approximately 20% of these diseases represent a spectrum of NDs, yet the overall contribute of MEIs to the etiology of NDs has not been systematically estimated. To address this, we will (1) characterize functional MEIs in GTEx cohorts in healthy individuals; (2) build a comprehensive functional map of MEIs to determine tissue-specific and brain-specific impact; and (3) impute transcriptional changes on various NDs where whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data will be generated. The proposed application will also develop an extensive research program for Dr. Dadi Gao, a computational biologist and statistical geneticist who has trained in functional genomic studies of alternative splicing in neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic targeting of a splicing defect that causes a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. He has developed novel methods to investigate regulation of the transcriptome and to facilitate analyses in drug development. He now seeks to expand his expertise by applying statistical and deep learning models on large cohorts of sequencing data from controls and cases with NDs from post-mortem tissues, then impute functional consequences of MEIs from WGS in large-scale disease cohorts. The training plan consists of two years of mentored research to learn new skills in genome analysis, MEI characterization, and advanced deep learning techniques, followed by three years of shaping an independent laboratory. The research plan is developed to comprehensively explore functional variation in the genome by decomposing transcriptomic changes against MEIs. Dr. Michael Talkowski at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and the Broad Institute will serve as the primary mentor, while Dr. Manolis Kellis at MIT and the MIT Computational Biology Group, and the Broad Institute will serve as a co-mentor and close collaborator. These mentors are recognized experts in genomic structural variants, functional genomics, the genetics of neurological disorders, and computational modeling to establish functional elements in the human genome. In addition, a team of independent investigators from basic and translational research will provide Dr. Gao with comprehensive feedback to keep both his science and career development on track. The highly collaborative environment in CGM, MGH, Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute and the University of Michigan Medical School will prepare Dr. Gao for his transition to an independent investigator. This outstanding mentorship team and training program will facilitate the career development of Dr. Gao as he seeks to redefine the functional maps of MEIs in the human genome and to impute their impact in large-scale neurological disorders."
10871803,"With aging, there is a precipitous loss in activities of daily living (ADLs), and a decline in the function and repair
of musculoskeletal (MSK) tissues is a significant contributor to this loss. Veterans are particularly vulnerable to
a reduction in ADLs because the likelihood of experiencing severe trauma that injuries multiple MSK tissues is
higher in military service than in civilian life. While these severe traumatic injuries are less life-threatening now
than in the past, complications of MSK regeneration arise and lead to the requirement of assisted living later in
life. Thus, there is a strong need for preclinical models of polytrauma injury that facilitate studies into the
mechanisms connecting poor MSK repair to fewer ADLs. Several such models exist in the literature, but none
have been validated with respect to the key clinical problems associated with impaired MSK regeneration,
namely delayed fracture healing, muscle fibrosis or soft tissue calcification, osteoporosis, cognitive impairment,
pain sensitivity, and hyper-inflammation. Therefore, the goal of this project is to validate a murine model of
combined injuries – skin burn, muscle injury to the lower hindlimb, and fracture of the femur mid-shaft – for its
ability to recapitulate many of the problems that reduce ADLs. In Aim 1, we will compare the healing response
of adult, transgenic mice among 3 injury groups: i) single femur fracture or single muscle injury in the lower
hindlimb, ii) femur fracture plus single muscle injury, and iii) combined femur fracture, muscle injury, and skin
burn. These transgenic mice express luciferase when the NFκB regulatory element is active, thereby allowing
us to image tissue inflammation by bioluminescence. To validate the model, we will determine if fracture healing
is delayed at 28-days post injury (DPI) and muscle fibrosis persists at 42-DPI in the polytrauma mice compared
to the single injury mice. In Aim 2, using the same mice in Aim 1 but adding sham littermates (no injury), we will
compare the effect of injury on degeneration among 5 groups: i) sham control, ii) single femur fracture, iii) single
muscle injury in the lower hindlimb, iv) dual injury to bone and muscle, and v) combined polytrauma injury with
skin burn. Starting at baseline (before injury) and at post-injury intervals, areal bone mineral density (dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry) of the uninjured femur, whole-body weight (mass), cognitive function (novel object
recognition test), pain sensitivity (allodynia and hyperalgesia to mechanical stimuli), duration of sleep (cage
activity), and mobility (voluntary wheel running plus gait analysis) will be assessed until 42-DPI. Additionally, the
contralateral, uninjured femur and the lumbar vertebral body will be imaged ex vivo by μCT and subjected to
load-to-failure tests in three-point bending (femurs) or in compression (vertebra) to determine whether the cortical
structure, trabecular micro-architecture, volumetric bone mineral density, and strength are different among the
groups. To validate the model of combined polytrauma with respect to degeneration, bone loss and bone strength
will need to be higher and lower in the combined injury group than in the no-injury, sham group, respectively. In
addition, our other validation goal is to demonstrate that the combined MSK injury to bone and muscle with skin
burn also impairs memory, causes hypersensitivity to pain, reduces duration of sleep, and reduces movement
as these are clinical complications of polytrauma. In Aim 3, blood samples will be collected at euthanasia from
the mice in Aim 1 (28-DPI and 42-DPI) as well as from additional NFκB reporter mice at earlier time points (1-
DPI, 3-DPI, 7-DPI, and 14-DPI) so that we can quantify the temporal changes in the hyper-inflammatory response
to injury. Prior to euthanasia, we will image all mice in vivo to assess tissue inflammation, and after euthanasia,
we will image individual organs ex vivo. To validate the model, systemic hyper-inflammation and tissue
inflammation will occur for a longer period time in the polytrauma combined group than in the single injury group.
With a validated murine model of polytrauma that possesses many of the clinical problems associated with poor
regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue, future studies can identify and investigate mechanisms, therapeutic
strategies, and prognosticators that will help Veterans maintain activities of daily living as they age."
10872997,"Anti-tumor immune responses depend on T cell recognition of tumor antigens in the context of major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins to destroy tumors. While the MHC class I antigen presentation
pathway in melanoma cells has a well-established role in immune-mediated destruction of tumors, the function
of the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway in melanoma cells is not well understood. The goal of this
proposal is to determine the function of MHC class II and the MHC class II antigen processing enzyme, GILT,
in melanoma cells in regulating the anti-tumor immune response and response to immunotherapy. Preliminary
results from the laboratory of the PI revealed that the MHC class II antigen presentation pathway and GILT, an
enzyme involved in MHC class II antigen processing, are associated with improved survival in melanoma.
Recent data from other groups show that induction of MHC class II expression on melanoma cells is
associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 in retrospective analyses.
Immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 is being used to treat a rapidly growing number of cancer types
and patients. Yet, the challenge remains that at least 60% and 25% of melanoma patients exhibit primary and
acquired resistance to this therapy, respectively. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the MHC
class II antigen presentation pathway in melanoma cells enhances T cell-mediated destruction of tumors and
improves the response to immune checkpoint blockade. To test this hypothesis clinically-relevant,
immunogenic mouse models of melanoma will be employed to determine the role of GILT and MHC class II in
melanoma cells on regulating the anti-tumor immune response and response to immunotherapy. This research
team will determine the immunomodulatory effects of GILT and MHC class II expression in melanoma cells
and identify immune cell types required for the modulation of tumor growth. Impact: New knowledge gained
from the completion of these studies is anticipated to lead to improved patient outcomes. Determining the
biological basis for MHC class II pathway members in the anti-tumor immune response and response to
immunotherapy is expected to 1) identify novel causal determinants of immunologically hot vs. cold tumors, 2)
provide support for a personalized medicine approach to optimize immunotherapy efficacy and limit side
effects, and 3) define a novel pathway controlling anti-tumor immune responses that can be manipulated to
augment treatment efficacy. The results of these studies are anticipated to be broadly applicable, as many
cancers express MHC class II and all cancer types share the challenge of resistance to immunotherapy."

This proposal brings together Dr. Javid Moslehi, a cardio-oncologist and myocyte biologist, and Dr. Justin Balko,
a cancer biologist and immunologist, to define the immunologic and antigenic drivers of myocarditis associated
with cancer immunotherapies. Specifically, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), which block the activity of immune
‘brakes’, such as CTLA-4 or PD-1, have revolutionized treatment for many cancer types but by activating the
immune system, they can lead to autoimmune phenomena, called immune-related adverse events. Our group
has defined the clinical features of ICI-associated myocarditis, characterized by T cell and macrophage infiltration
into the myocardium, fulminant arrhythmias, concurrent myositis, and high fatality rate. To study this entity in
more depth, we have generated pre-clinical mouse models that recapitulate ICI-associated myocarditis:
specifically, a genetic mouse model, where the genes for PD-1 (Pdcd1) and CTLA-4 (Ctla4) are deleted, leads
to early death due to myocarditis which recapitulates human ICI-myocarditis clinically and pathologically.
Surprisingly, the mice do not have systemic autoimmunity; rather the T cell infiltration is limited to the
cardiovascular system and specifically the heart. Similarly, the infiltration seen in patients is often limited to T
cell and macrophage infiltration into striated muscle, namely the heart and skeletal muscle. In this grant, we
hypothesize that specific CD8+ T cell infiltrates restricted to one or more myocardial antigens are the drivers of
pathogenesis in ICI-myocarditis. We seek to define the T cells responsible for the etiology and pathogenesis of
ICI-myocarditis and to demonstrate that specific T cell populations are both necessary and sufficient to drive
pathogenesis (Aim 1). Additionally, we seek to define the antigen targets of ICI-myocarditis in mice and in
patients (Aim 2). We leverage a team of experts in cardiology, oncology and immunology to test our hypothesis
through conduction of these studies. In addition, we have leveraged a large international network of collaborators
to collect cases of ICI-associated myocarditis.
The overwhelming success of ICI is hampered in some patients by the development of fulminant toxicities,
including ICI-myocarditis. This proposal will allow us to generate insights into the mechanisms of this entity,
which we feel can translate into more effective treatment and prevention strategies. In addition, the unique team
of clinicians and scientists we have assembled for this proposal allows incorporation of new technology which
will allow better interrogation of the interactions between the cardiovascular and immune systems translating into
better insights in other forms of inflammatory cardiovascular diseases."
10874386,"Atherosclerosis is a complicated cardiovascular disease that stems from prolonged chronic inflammation. This inflammation causes and is also the result of activated monocyte/macrophage infiltration through arterial walls which eventually leads to a necrotic core plaque that narrows the lumen and may lead to catastrophic rupture and death. Vitamin D is known to invoke an anti-inflammatory program in cultured macrophages by decreasing factors such as IL-1β and TNFα. Vitamin D activation to calcitriol (1,25(OH)2D3), occurs mainly in the kidney by the CYP27B1 enzyme, however, nonrenal target cells (NRTCs), such as the macrophage, express low levels of this enzyme as well, and therefore may produce calcitriol at low levels, locally. This NRTC produced calcitriol is hypothesized to reduce inflammation and positively impact disease progression. Importantly though, these mechanisms remain very poorly understood. In humans, the interpretation of local production of calcitriol has been confounded by the abundant levels of endocrine calcitriol produced by the kidney. We aim to eliminate these confounding issues by defining the production, features, biological impact and anti-disease potential of local activity in the absence of endocrine calcitriol by utilizing a unique mouse model we have created wherein the endocrine production of calcitriol in the kidney and thus blood levels of the endocrine hormone are highly deficient. Our use of this mouse model will enable us to explore key details of the importance of 25(OH)D3 uptake into NRTC tissues, the levels of calcitriol that are produced in these tissues, and the biological impact of this production in genetically modified mice that are sensitive to high fat diet-induced chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis. Based on the unique opportunity to separate the endocrine production of calcitriol from the NRTC, the overall hypothesis for this research study is that production of locally-acting calcitriol through cell-specific Cyp27b1 genomic enhancers can ameliorate the chronic inflammation associated with a high fat diet and atherosclerotic plaque formation. We will test this hypothesis by first establishing core principles of NRTC calcitriol production through AIM 1: exploiting our endocrine-deficient Cyp27b1 pseudo-null mouse model to investigate the impact of both 25(OH)D3 (substrate) status and vitamin D nutritional supplementation on NRTC synthesis of calcitriol and its genetic local impact, AIM 2: defining the NRTC- regulatory module (NRTC-RM) for Cyp27b1 expression that is functionally distinct from that of the kidney endocrine module and determine the mechanisms, epigenetics, and tissue-specific factors involved, and finally AIM 3: examining the nonrenal production of calcitriol and its impact on inflammation and on atherosclerotic plaque formation and calcification in Ldlr-/- mice in the disease state of high fat diet-induced chronic inflammation. This knowledge will provide support for nonrenal calcitriol benefits and will be clinically relevant in the design of human studies aimed at disease onset prevention and/or amelioration of symptoms during cardiovascular disease progression."
10817782,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
For patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the development of chronic wounds is a life-threatening complication
that necessitates over 100,000 lower extremity amputations per year in the U.S. alone. Despite improvements
in the management of DM, the treatment of diabetic wounds remains challenging due to the inherent defects in
wound healing in diabetic vs. normal skin. Underlying vasculopathies, neuropathies, increased inflammation,
and thickened basement membranes due to diabetes predispose the skin to developing non-healing wounds.
Moreover, diabetic skin exhibits increased oxidative stress and decreased expression of nuclear factor erythroid
2–related factor 2 (NRF2), a transcription factor that activates a pathway that protects cells from increased
oxidative stress. Several studies suggest that NRF2 activation could be a relevant target for the management
and prevention of chronic diabetic wounds. The current proposal utilizes novel small molecule NRF2 activators
that exhibit increased specificity of binding and decreased mutagenicity relative to existing compounds,
without sacrificing solubility, potency, or stability. These novel molecules are an innovative and optimal tool to
study the effects of NRF2 activation on diabetic skin. The long-term objective of this work is to develop
topically-applied NRF2-activating drugs for the treatment of human chronic diabetic wounds.
The goals of the current research are to test the ability of highly specific and novel NRF2
activators to improve diabetic wound healing and to understand their mechanisms of action. In
this study, the effects of NRF2 activation on diabetic wound healing will be investigated in db/db mice, a well-
characterized in vivo model system of DM. Aim 1A will determine the effects of this novel class of NRF2
activators on wound healing, including wound closure, oxidative stress, and the quality of tissue restoration.
Aim 1B will employ whole-tissue RNA-sequencing and functional pathway analysis to investigate the effects of
NRF2 activation in diabetic wounds at the transcriptome level. The data will be used to determine which
functional pathways regulated by NRF2 are important to diabetic skin pathology. Aim 2 will examine the
effects of our candidate molecules on macrophages and investigate whether these novel NRF2 activators act by
improving macrophage function in diabetic wound healing. Investigation into the effects of NRF2 activation on

10839464,"Summary
KRAS mutations activate Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 that can directly phosphorylate Mcl-1 at T163, enhancing Mcl-1’s
function. KRAS mutations also activate PI3K/AKT that can inactivate GSK-3 and inhibit GSK-3-mediated
pMcl-1 at S159 to reduce Mcl-1 degradation. We hypothesize that KRAS mutation-activated ERK1/2 and
PI3K/AKT pathways contribute to stabilization of Mcl-1 via upregulation of pMcl-1 at T163 and downregulation
of pMcl-1 at S159 in lung cancer. Our preliminary data show increased pMcl-1 at T163 in tumor tissues from
NSCLC patients, which associated with worse survival outcome, suggesting that pMcl-1 at T163 may provide a
new therapeutic target and a prognostic biomarker in NSCLC patients. We found that Mcl-1, in addition to its
canonical antiapoptotic function, plays a critical role in supporting homologous recombination (HR)-mediated
repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Based on this novel function, we discovered an entirely new class
of small molecule Mcl-1 inhibitor, MI-223, that interacts with the BH1 pocket of Mcl-1 and inhibits HR activity.
MI-223 has potent anti-tumor activity against lung cancer in vitro and in vivo. Olaparib is an FDA-approved
PARP-1 inhibitor with anti-cancer efficacy; however, only patients with HR deficiency (e.g. BRCA1/2 mutations)
respond to olaparib therapy. Since MI-223 inhibits HR-mediated DNA repair, this provides a rationale for
combining MI-223 and olaparib to treat various cancers, including those without BRCA1/2 mutations.
Combined treatment with MI-223 and olaparib synergistically suppresses lung cancer growth in vitro and in
vivo. Since our data indicate that KRAS mutations can activate Mcl-1, we hypothesize that MI-223 alone or in
combination with olaparib may be effective against lung cancers with KRAS mutations. MI-223-induced DSBs
upregulate PD-L1 in tumor tissue from mutant KRAS driven lung cancer model, suggesting combination of MI-
223 with anti-PD-L1 may overcome PD-1 inhibitor resistance in KRAS-mutant lung cancer. To characterize and
develop this novel Mcl-1 inhibitor MI-223 for the treatment of lung cancer, we propose two specific aims: (1)
Determine whether and how KRAS mutations activate Mcl-1 leading to treatment resistance in human lung
cancer cells. Studies will determine whether pMcl-1 at T163 is a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic
target in patients with NSCLC; (2) Determine mechanism of action of novel Mcl-1 inhibitor MI-223 in killing
human lung cancer cells. Studies will test the potency of MI-223 alone or in combination with PARP inhibitor
olaparib in patient-derived lung cancer xenograft (PDX), radioresistant, and KRAS-mutant lung cancer
xenografts. Determine whether MI-223 synergizes with olaparib or anti-PD-L1 to more effectively suppress
tumor growth and prolong survival in genetically engineered mutant KRAS-driven lung cancer animal models.
By targeting Mcl-1, we expect to develop a new class of anti-cancer agents and combination strategies for lung
cancer treatment."
10852828,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cleft palate (CP) is a common craniofacial structural birth defect caused by the incomplete closure of the
palate (the structure separating the oral and nasal cavities), resulting in feeding, speech, and hearing
problems. CP accounts for 33% of all orofacial clefts (OFCs) or approximately 1 in 1500 babies born
worldwide. Although CP is colloquially used to refer to all types orofacial clefts (e.g. cleft lip or cleft with cleft
palate), CP is embryologically and epidemiologically distinct from orofacial clefts involving the lip, suggesting a
unique genetic etiology. The risk of CP recurrence in first degree relatives is over 50-fold higher than the
population risk, suggesting a strong genetic component. However, there have been a dearth of genetic studies
for CP. Three well-powered genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis have revealed only two
associated loci, neither of which account for a large portion of the genetic heritability in any population. The
lack of common variant associations suggest that the etiology of CP may be similar to other congenital
anomalies, such as congenital heart disease, which often result from de novo mutations, inherited rare
variants, and structural variation. We propose to elucidate the genetic architecture of CP by: (1) analyzing
coding and noncoding de novo, inherited, and structural variants in whole genome sequencing of over 550
case-parent trios in a well-phenotyped, multi-ethnic cohort with CP; (2) integrating these data with
transcriptomic data from mouse and human palate to identify pathways underlying specific CP subtypes; and
(3) determine if CP risk variants/genes show pleiotropic effects in other birth defects and developmental
disorders. This project is poised to rapidly advance our understanding of the genetic etiology of CP and
translate risk to families, and may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment for individuals with CP."
10833589,"Project Title: Evaluation of Antibody Responses Elicited by Zika Vaccination in Flavivirus-naïve and -
experienced Individuals
Project Summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the flavivirus genus that recently precipitated widespread cases of neurological
pathology and congenital neurologic defects. In response, a multilateral coalition of investigators designed and
developed multiple vaccine candidates that elicited potent ZIKV-neutralizing antibodies, which were shown to
correlate with disease protection in animal models. Despite these advances, it remains unclear how the ZIKV
immunization antibody response is shaped in humans with and without prior exposure to other flaviviruses, such
as dengue virus (DENV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV) or yellow fever virus (YFV); particularly as these viruses
all have significant epidemiologic overlap with ZIKV. Our long-term goal is to understand the underlying humoral
mechanisms generated by flavivirus vaccination, which can provide long-term protection in flavivirus-naïve
and/or -experienced populations. Such information would guide vaccination strategies in flavivirus-endemic
areas or among flavivirus-naïve individuals traveling to endemic areas. The overall objective of this proposed
research is to evaluate the specificity and function of the B cell repertoire elicited by ZIKV vaccination in flavivirus-
naïve and -experienced individuals. To achieve these goals, this research will utilize leading-edge technologies
to sequence B cell receptors (BCRs) from flavivirus-specific, single B cells using RNAseq and Next Generation
Sequencing (NGS). BCRs will be compared between Zika vaccinated individuals, and to previously published
monoclonal antibodies, to determine the prevalence of B cell lineages, gene assignment, degree of somatic
hypermutation (SHM), and lengths of heavy chain complementary-determining region 3 (HCDR3). Common B
cell lineages will be expressed as monoclonal antibodies and evaluated for their specificity, function, structural,
and ability to protect against flavivirus challenges in mouse models. A total of 40 samples will be evaluated from
individuals representing 5 groups in 3 different Phase I Zika vaccine clinical trials: a) Flavivirus-naïve individuals
who were vaccinated using a Zika purified inactivated whole virus vaccine (ZPIV) b) Flavivirus-naïve individuals
who were vaccinated with an adeno-vectored Zika M-E (Ad26.ZIKV.M-Env) c) Individuals living in Puerto Rico
with prior dengue infection who were ZPIV vaccinated d) JEV (IXIARO®) vaccinated individuals who were ZPIV
vaccinated and e) YFV (YV-VAX®) vaccinated individuals who were ZPIV vaccinated. Flavivirus-naïve, Zika
vaccinated individuals (Groups a-b) will be explored in Aim 1 and Flavivirus-experienced individuals, either by
prior infection (Group c) or by prior vaccination (Groups d-e), will be explored in Aim 2. Aim 3 will examine a late
timepoint (6 months) following the last ZPIV vaccination to determine the longevity of the circulating B cell
lineages characterized in Aims 1 and 2. Evaluating prevalent B cell lineages responding to Zika vaccination will
reveal the specificity, function and durability of the humoral response among individuals living in different regions.
These studies will provide insights into the potency and durability of ZIKV vaccine responses in both flavivirus-
naïve and -experienced individuals and may translate into vaccine strategies that yield long-lived protection."
10828382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and death worldwide. As
a result, the U.S. CDC has classified C. difficile (CD) as an urgent public health threat. Recent guidelines from
Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America recommended oral
vancomycin or fidaxomicin for both non-severe and severe CDI cases. Because of the high cost of fidaxomicin,
vancomycin is now the drug of choice, making it the most important antibiotic for the treatment of CDI.
The foundation for this work is based on our recent discovery of CD strains in patients from Texas and
Kenya exhibiting reduced susceptibility to both metronidazole and vancomycin. We examined diarrhea CDI
stools from 438 patients from Texas and 98 from Kenya for the presence of metronidazole- and vancomycin-non-
susceptible CD isolates. Of the stools from Houston, 114/438 (26%) grew CD isolates that were not susceptible to
vancomycin, 128/438 (29%) to metronidazole, and 97/438 (22%) to both metronidazole and vancomycin. Among
the Kenyan patients, 66/98 (67%) were not susceptible to vancomycin, 83/98 (85%) to metronidazole, and 57/98
(58%) to both antibiotics. Alarmingly, many of the isolates from both locations showed levels of non-susceptibility to
these antibiotics that far exceeded their known MICs. Whole-genome sequencing showed the presence of
homologs of vanA and vanB gene clusters, common mediators of high-level vancomycin resistance in many
hospital-associated pathogens. Until now, such high-level vancomycin non-susceptibility has not been reported in
CD strains. The spread of CD strains resistant to vancomycin, a front-line antibiotic for this life-threatening
pathogen, will have serious clinical and public health implications. This underscores an urgent need for a
comprehensive analysis of the circulating strains, mechanisms of resistance, and how it impacts clinical outcomes
to help inform clinical decisions. Our preliminary evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that vancomycin
non-susceptible CD strains may be widespread in the CDI patient population and that strains circulating on
the African continent may be genetically different from strains circulating in North America. To investigate
this hypothesis, we will (i) assess the proportion of CDI patients from Texas and Kenya infected with vancomycin
non-susceptible strains and compare the infecting strains; (ii) characterize the genetic elements associated with
vancomycin non-susceptibility; and (iii) prospectively follow CDI patients infected with vancomycin non-susceptible
strains to assess disease severity, clinical outcome, and rate of recurrence of the infection following treatment.
Due to the current importance of vancomycin in CDI treatment, the proposed research will have a major
impact on clinical decisions. Importantly, the genetic elements responsible for high-level vancomycin non-
susceptibility in CD strains and how it impacts disease severity, clinical outcome, and treatment will be
established. This will provide insight into the extent of resistance and open up new avenues for long-term
preventative and interventional strategies to mitigate deaths associated with this life-threatening pathogen."

This U24 renewal is a cooperative agreement responsive to RFA-ES-22-001, “Maintaining and Enriching
Environmental Epidemiology Cohorts to Support Scientific and Workforce Diversity.” Our overarching
goal is to sustain, enrich and diversify resource infrastructure for the Rhode Island Children’s Health Study
(RICHS; Marsit, Stroud MPI: R24ES028507) by facilitating future longitudinal follow-up, accelerating data man-
agement and sharing, and diversifying the scientific workforce. RICHS was developed to characterize the impact
of the environment on newborn and early childhood health outcomes with a novel and unique focus on the
mechanistic role of placenta molecular function in mediating the impact of the chemical, physical, social, and
behavioral environment on infant/child health and disease. The cohort is comprised of 840 mother-infant pairs
from the Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts region enrolled using a population-based recruitment
strategy. RICHS offspring at the start of this project range in age from 8.8-13.8 years—a critical period for envi-
ronmental influences on development. Data and results from the cohort have made seminal contributions to
elucidating (a) the fundamental molecular biology of the placenta, (b) the impact of environmental exposures on
placental epigenetic and genomic regulation, (c) links between placental molecular variation and newborn growth
and neurobehavioral outcomes, as well as (d) novel methods development. Resources/investigators from the
RICHS cohort contributed to 75 publications (42 during the R24 period), 10 NIH grants including fellowship and
career development awards for early career scientists, and >20 post/doctoral projects. The proposed U24 infra-
structure support will facilitate prospective, longitudinal assessments of novel child health and disease outcomes,
postnatal environmental exposures, structural and social determinants of health, as well as continued collection
of biospecimens into the RICHS biorepository. The U24 will also support enrichment of data management and
broad sharing of cohort resources, with all activities aimed at providing opportunities for a diverse cadre of sci-
entists across career stages to access to data and biospecimens to develop novel research questions. Specifi-
cally, the goals of this R24 infrastructure support project are to (1) support the infrastructure of diverse workforce
of the cohort, (2) continue to obtain longitudinal data on mother-child pairs, (3) broaden the diversity of RICHS
by facilitating enrollment of new participants from complementary Rhode Island cohorts, (4) refine and expand
systems for broad sharing of cohort data and resources, (5) increase opportunities for scholars from historically
under-represented groups to engage with the RICHS cohort, and (6) work with the consortium in developing
integrated measures and common strategies for data sharing and collaboration. Ultimately, U24 infrastructure
support will maximize NIEHS investment by increasing diversity of participants, workforce, and
measures in this highly unique and productive cohort, accelerating discovery and catalyzing future
transformative contributions to children’s environmental health."
10758541,"PROGRAM SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Progress in treating and preventing a range of disabling neurological conditions is severely hampered by a
shortage of underrepresented minority (URM) clinician-researchers in neurology in the US. To help fill this
gap, we propose the BRAIN (Building Research Aspirations In Neurology) R25 program at NYU Langone
Health. The BRAIN program is an interdisciplinary program that will introduce undergraduate students
interested in the neurosciences to clinical neurology research that focuses on reducing the burden of
neurologic disease. There are significant healthcare disparities in terms of neurologic disease severity and
issues related to access to care within underserved populations, and it is unknown whether certain treatments
are better for certain ethnic and racial groups. Thus, with the growing shortage of neurologists, the aim of
BRAIN is to improve the neurology pipeline and to conduct research that helps advance knowledge and
treatment of these burdensome conditions. Students in the program will learn about translational
neuroscience, epidemiology, and patient-centered research. To train and develop young clinician
researchers to meet the urgency of this health need, eight to ten undergraduate students, the majority of
whom are from URM groups, who attend undergraduate institutions within NYC, will be selected to participate
in an intensive 10-week hands-on research and education training each summer followed by an extended
learning experience throughout the academic year. During the academic year, students will continue their
research with the intent to submit and present their research at regional and national meetings, and publish
their findings in peer-reviewed publications. There will be monthly BRAIN meetings which will include career
development sessions on topics such as leadership development and time management, and scheduled
check-ins to ensure the students are on track with their abstract and manuscript preparations and
submissions. In summary, the BRAIN program will comprise education on conducting and communicating
research as well as performing an individual or small group -based research capstone project. We will track
both short-term performance metrics of the BRAIN program and longer-term impacts on career trajectories for
students completing the BRAIN program. We expect BRAIN students will continue their education by entering
medical school to pursue a career in clinical research, and that ultimately, beyond the timeline of this program,
pursue a neurology program and consider a career as a clinician -researcher in neurology."
10809625,"Project Summary / Abstract
The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how age- and obesity-related gut
microbiome changes are reflected in the knee cartilage microbiome and how these changes may be
associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA) with a particular focus on epigenetics. OA is a leading cause of
disability among Veterans and occurs at roughly 5x the rate of civilians. The incidence of OA rises with
increases in age and obesity, and previously published studies have outlined gut microbiome changes with
both age and obesity. Furthermore, OA in mice related to obesity can be lessened through dietary
interventions that reshape the microbiome, and we have recently described a novel cartilage microbiome in
humans and mice that changes with OA development. Our laboratory has previously examined in detail the
epigenetic changes within cartilage, subchondral bone, and peripheral blood that are associated with OA
development, and we have generated preliminary data that microbial DNA amplified from human OA
cartilage can induce similar epigenetic changes in chondrocytes in vitro. In this project, our first Aim is to
determine whether age- and obesity-related changes in the gut microbiome in human OA patients and
healthy controls are reflected in similar changes in various joint microbiome niches, including cartilage,
subchondral bone, and synovium. To do this, we will obtain paired cecal and cartilage samples from end-
stage OA patients undergoing total knee replacement and matched control cadaveric samples from the
NDRI. We will then profile microbiomes using 16s bacterial gene next-generation sequencing. We will
then generate machine learning models of microbial changes associated with normal aging and obesity and
compare these with OA-aging and OA-obesity. Our second Aim will determine whether age- and/or
obesity-related cartilage microbiome changes impact OA outcomes and the cartilage microbiome
specifically, using fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) from human OA patients with and without
aging and obesity into germ-free mice, and evaluating OA outcomes following DMM surgery. We will also
examine both systemic and local inflammation associated with differences in microbiome transplants at
prespecified timepoints using CyTOF. Our third Aim will evaluate epigenetic changes both within joint
tissues and inflammatory cells induced by differences in the gut microbiome, using the same transplantation
groups as in Aim 2. The proposed work is important, as we do not have a full understanding of why age
and obesity are associated with increases in OA risk, nor do we understand how the cartilage microbiome
influences OA risk. Our work is quite innovative in its use of paired gut and cartilage microbial samples,
the next-generation techniques used to evaluate the microbiome, and our use of germ-free mouse
microbiome transplantation to evaluate OA outcomes. We will also be the first to apply whole-genome
bisulfite sequencing techniques to investigate the epigenetic changes within human and mouse cartilage
that are altered by the local microbiome and associated with OA development. Finally, we will be the first
to evaluate whether gut microbiome transplantation may be used as a therapeutic agent to alter age- and
obesity-related OA risk. Success in our proposal may open a new avenue for OA aging research and may
offer a novel treatment strategy for OA."
10589390,"As a board-certified VA anesthesiologist and cardiovascular physiologist, I study protective mechanisms
against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury of vital organs ultimately geared to help our often multi-morbid Veteran
patients who are at an increased risk for myocardial infarction and, thus, cardiac arrest (CA). In fact, more than
380,000 patients in the US alone suffer an out-of-hospital CA each year, a leading cause of often debilitating
illness and death worldwide. Timely reperfusion by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is of utmost
importance; yet, reperfusion itself paradoxically adds to IR injury, lethal arrhythmias and cell death, and even
with the best mechanical CPR, >90% still have severe neurological deficits or die. Thus, organ-protective
strategies early during resuscitation are desperately warranted. The beneficial effect of ventilating with the non-
anesthetic noble gas Argon (Ar) after successful resuscitation, i.e. return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC),
has been tested in only very few CA studies, none of which, though, has utilized Ar to its full potential of
organ protection when given immediately upon reperfusion, i.e. the very beginning of CPR, to increase the rate
of ROSC, nor have they explored specific mechanisms of action. Despite lack of chemical reactivity due to
completely filled outer electron orbitals, noble gases can exert discernible biological effects by interacting with
signaling proteins, ion channels, and/or receptors. Supported by strong preliminary ex and in vivo data, we
hypothesize that Ar improves survival and neurologically favorable outcome after prolonged CA and extended
CPR by i) decreasing arrhythmias and ii) increasing vital organ perfusion primarily due to pulmonary
vasorelaxation with increased right-to-left blood flow and, thus, increased systemic cardiac output and blood
flow to vital organs during and after CPR. Hence, our revised multi-pronged study has three specific aims:
AIM 1: Define the mechanism by which Ar exerts its anti-arrhythmic effect. In vitro electrophysiological
patch-clamping experiments complement ex vivo optical mapping in rat isolated hearts in the absence/
presence of Ar with or without IR. Experiments in Aim 3 will confirm and quantify the benefit of this effect in
vivo. This provides the first systematic characterization of Ar’s anti-arrhythmic properties.
AIM 2: Define the mechanism by which Ar regulates pulmonary and peripheral vascular tone. Experi-
ments in rat isolated systemic and pulmonary vessels will be scaled up and tested in ex vivo models of isolated
intact hearts and lungs with or without IR and in the absence or presence of Ar and/or putative pathway
agonists or antagonists. Experiments in Aim 3 will confirm and quantify the benefits of these effects in vivo.
This will lead to previously undescribed mechanisms of vascular tone regulations by Ar.
AIM 3: Evaluate the therapeutic potential of early Ar inhalation to improve ROSC, cardiac and cerebral
recovery and survival after prolonged CA and extended CPR. A directly preclinical in vivo survival model
of prolonged ventricular fibrillation, extended mechanical CPR and state-of-the-art neurological assessment in
pigs will complement non-survival and survival CA studies in rats to define clinically relevant effects of early Ar
inhalation on survival and recovery of cardiac and neurological function. A purely postconditioning effect when
Ar is applied only after ROSC will be tested against its immediate administration at the very beginning of CPR.
This revised and further improved, highly innovative proposal by an expanded team of well-established
researchers and physicians in resuscitation science will shed much needed new light on the mechanisms and
qualitative and quantitative effects of organ protection and improved survival by early Ar inhalation after
prolonged CA and extended CPR. It will help develop a completely novel, potentially game-changing therapy in
cardio-cerebral resuscitation, ready to be tested in clinical studies with the potential to significantly improve
survival, functional recovery and quality of life in thousands of CA patients each year, including Veterans, with
otherwise bleak outcomes."
10814806,"This project leverages a cyanobacterial model system to answer the following questions: what are the molecular
interactions that mark the passage of time in a cell, where do they occur in the cell, how do they mediate temporal
regulation of events, and why does biological timing matter for fitness? The circadian biological clock is an
oscillatory timer that drives 24-h rhythms of biological activities. Clock dysfunction in humans is related to a
spectrum of health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, mental illness, and
sleep disorders. However, the circadian clock is pervasive well beyond mammals, promoting fitness in diverse
organisms throughout the phylogenetic tree. The circadian clock of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus
elongatus generates bona fide circadian rhythms of genetic, physiological, and metabolic activities that fulfill all
criteria that define circadian clocks in eukaryotes. In this genetically tractable model organism it is possible to
systematically alter the physical and biochemical properties of clock proteins and trace the impact of these
changes from their proximal effects, through the protein-interaction network, to the expressed circadian
phenotype. A new in vitro preparation comprising the oscillator proteins KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, along with the
kinases CikA and SasA and the transcription factor RpaA, reconstitutes the circadian rhythm of binding of RpaA
to its target promoter with a real-time readout. This project will apply the in vitro clock and other technical and
conceptual advances towards biochemical, cytological, genomic, and physiological objectives that will answer
the target questions. The in vitro clock will reveal the molecular events that occur when the clock resets to an
environmental timing cue, identify the sites of action of nucleotides that modulate the timing circuit, and determine
how RpaA and a second transcription factor that is regulated by environmental signals, RpaB, work together to
influence circadian phasing. The discovery that the kinases SasA and CikA impart tolerance to fluctuating
oscillator component concentrations will overcome past hurdles for establishing a circadian circuit in Escherichia
coli as a naïve model system for exploring clock connections to cellular physiology and for biotechnology
applications. High-resolution cryo-electron tomography and focused ion-beam milling will be used to visualize
clock-controlled daily changes in intracellular organization and the clock complex itself. The molecular basis and
fitness advantage of circadian control of natural transformation will be determined. A bar-coded transposon
library first used to identify all genes required for photoautotrophic growth will be used to identify new loci that
contribute to fitness in a day-night cycle. Paired with physiological and metabolic assays, these experiments will
answer the question: why does the timing of molecular events matter? Together, these approaches will elucidate
clock mechanisms and the value of the clock to diurnal physiology, and will advance biotechnological
opportunities for controlling metabolism in both photosynthetic and traditional bacterial production systems."
10810688,"ABSTRACT
 Ion transfer across biological membranes is central to nerve excitation, muscle cell contraction, signal
transduction, and hormone secretion. Ion channels play a vital role by providing a passageway within
membranes to allow specific ions to traverse down their electrochemical gradient. The immense physiological
importance of ion channels is reflected in the fact that their dysfunction underlies a variety of disabling human
diseases including seizures, deafness, ataxia, long QT syndrome, and cardiac arrhythmias. There is a long
history of physiological work and a large body of functional and structural data on tetrameric cation channels
that are localized to the plasma membrane, including the K+, Ca2+, Na+, TRP and cyclic nucleotide-gated
channels; however, relatively little is known about organellar cation channels, partly because of the difficulty in
directly measuring their activities in organellar membranes. Currently, there is an emerging research interest in
the recently identified organellar cation channels due to their importance in organelle physiology and cell
signaling. This Maximizing Investigators' Research Award proposal will be focused on our ongoing efforts to
dissect the structural and functional properties of two specific groups of organellar cation channels: the
endolysosomal cation channels and the mitochondrial calcium uniporters. The insights gained from the
proposed studies will facilitate our understanding of how these organellar channels regulate some basic
biological functions of lysosome and mitochondria.
 Endosomes and lysosomes play crucial roles in many biological processes such as protein and lipid
degradation, catabolite export, membrane trafficking, and metabolism-sensing, and defects to these processes
can result in lysosomal storage diseases. These acidic organelles contain various ion channels that control
endolysosomal pH and ionic homeostasis. One major research direction in my lab is designed to reveal the
structural basis of gating and selectivity in endolysosomal cation channels, including two-pore channels
(TPCs), transient receptor potential mucolipin channels (TRPMLs), and the non-canonical TMEM175 K+
channels. Mitochondria can take up large amounts of Ca2+ from cytosol, a process that can modulate ATP
production, alter cytoplasmic Ca2+ dynamics, and trigger cell death. Mitochondrial calcium uptake is mediated
by the mitochondria calcium uniporter (MCU), a highly selective Ca2+ channel that is localized to the inner
mitochondrial membrane. In humans, the uniporter functions as a protein complex consisting of at least four
components: the pore-forming MCU, the essential membrane-spanning subunit EMRE, and the Ca2+-sensing
gate-keeping proteins MICU1 and MICU2. Another major project in the lab aims to reveal the structural basis of
the human MCU complex assembly and the channel regulation. Our experimental approach utilizes single
particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and protein crystallography to determine the three-dimensional
structures of these channels, and electrophysiology to elucidate their biophysical properties."
10590147,"One debilitating mental health problem among veterans is post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), which is an anxiety disorder and develops following the experience of life-threatening
psychological trauma. A central feature of PTSD is a persistent, pervasive fear response after
the threat is no longer present. This is caused by a failure to extinguish the fear memory, a
process that involves learning that the stimulus is no longer associated with the aversive events.
This is a form of inhibitory learning and produces a lasting decrease in the conditioned fear
response (“extinction memory”). Extensive research has been conducted on
the
amygdala
and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
.
The knowledge gained from these studies has enabled
the development of psychotherapeutic interventions that aim to attenuate fear memory by
enhancing extinction. However nearly half of the patients do not respond to exposure therapy.
This failure highlights the need to move beyond a traditional amygdala- and mPFC-focused
investigation of extinction. The second approach is to disrupt the reconsolidation process.
Consolidated memory can become transiently labile following reactivation trials and undergoes
a reconsolidation process that re-stabilizes the fear memory. During this short window, memory
can be disrupted. This offers a window of opportunity for reduce the original fear memory with
amnestic agents as a treatment for PTSD. The cerebellum regulates emotional behavior
and forms extensive reciprocal connections with cortical regions, including PFC. It is critically
involved in both the consolidation and reconsolidation of fear memory. Our preliminary results
show that inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cell activity impaired extinction memory. We will test
the hypotheses that reactivation reduces endocannabinoid signaling in the cerebellum to
restabilize memory in Aim 1. Aim 2 will test whether extinction increases endocannabinoid
signaling in the cerebellum and this is required for extinction memory. We will determine
whether inhibition of a transcription factor that regulates an endocannabinoid degrading enzyme
disrupts the reconsolidation of fear memory and facilitates extinction memory. Because the
proposed study investigates a new mechanism underlying the regulation of endocannabinoid
metabolism by reactivation and extinction, it could suggest a novel treatment strategy for PTSD
and a new therapeutic target."
10734786,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Sneathia vaginalis (Sv) is emerging as a pathogen that is significantly associated with preterm birth and can
cause numerous infections including amnionitis, osteoarthritis, meningitis, bacteremia, and urethritis. Due to its
fastidious nature, it has only recently been recognized as a pathogen through the use of DNA-based methods.
Because it has been under-recognized as a pathogen, the biology and the pathogenesis of S. vaginalis remain
almost entirely uncharacterized. We have identified a hemolytic and cytopathogenic toxin produced by S.
vaginalis that we have named CptA. Antiserum against CptA abrogates traversal of Sv across intact human fetal
membranes suggesting that the toxin plays a role in pathogenesis. This project has three main goals. The first
is to assess the maternal and fetal antibody response to CptA during natural colonization/infection. The second
is to establish the role of CptA in traversal of and damage to fetal membranes by Sv. The third is to determine
whether the association between Sv and preterm birth is causal by developing a mouse model of Sv infection
during pregnancy. pathogenesis Characterization of this novel pore-forming toxin will break ground in our
understanding of this emerging pathogen."

For HIV cure approaches to be widely implemented, they will need to be safe, affordable and
highly effective. The development strategies that allow therapeutic agents to be infused into
people living with HIV (PLWH) rather than being manufactured ex vivo may represent an
important step to reaching this goal. In this application, the investigators merged their expertise
in mRNA lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNPs) and HIV CAR technology to propose to develop
injectable agents that will target and remove the latent reservoir. A key advantage of this
approach is that we can target tissues and cells such as the reproductive track or T follicular
cells where CTLs are either excluded or have diminished activity. In Aim 1, we will optimize the
composition of these mRNA-LNPs performing in vitro studies. Once lead compounds are
identified, we will test these in humanized mouse for in vivo activity. Finally, using a state of the
art non-human primate model we will test the ability of mRNA-LNP complexes to reduce the
viral reservoir."
10796921,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibiotic tolerance describes differential susceptibility of an isogenic bacterial population to bactericidal
antibiotics. Antibiotic tolerance contributes to two clinically relevant phenotypes: populations with increased
antibiotic tolerance are harder to eradicate and need prolonged antibiotic therapy – a hallmark of tuberculosis;
and antibiotic tolerance has been shown in some organisms to act as a stepping stone to bona fide drug-
resistance. However, there are many forms of antibiotic tolerance – ranging from non-replicating persisters to
growing phenotypic resister cells – and these most likely represent diverse physiological states, mediated by
distinct molecular mechanisms. The relative prevalence of these forms of tolerance in clinical isolates of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis – the cause of tuberculosis – is completely unknown, as is the relative contribution
of distinct types of tolerance to in vivo antibiotic susceptibility and development of antibiotic resistance. We have
developed assays that can measure the relative tolerant subpopulation caused by non-replicating persistence
and growing phenotypic resistance to the first-line anti-TB antibiotic rifampicin. Using these assays, we will
measure the relative prevalence of these distinct forms of tolerance in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis
representing all major phylogenetic groups. By transposon insertion mutagenesis and deep-sequencing (Tnseq),
we will dissect the genetic requirements for tolerance both in vitro and in a novel murine model of tuberculosis
infection, using B6.Sp140 -/- mice that recapitulate the hallmarks of infection such as necrotic granulomata of
C3H/FeJ ‘Kramnik’ mice. We will also determine the contribution of these two forms of rifampicin tolerance to
the development of rifampicin-resistance in select clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, and perform Tnseq to
identify genetic contributors to resistance. Together, these studies will further our understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of distinct forms of rifampicin tolerance in clinical strains of tuberculosis, and their relevance to the
development of genetic resistance."

Suboptimal myelination of the brain, whether developmental or degenerative, has major
ramifications on function. Abnormal myelin slows nerve conduction and signal synchronicity with
consequences such as seizures, intellectual disability, autism and accelerated age-related
cognitive decline. We have identified an approximately 1.6 megabase region of human
chromosome 18q23 that when hemizygous results in a failure of myelin to develop normally.
However, it is not yet known if the cause of this dysmyelination is due to haploinsufficiency of one
of the gene products or a synergistic effect of more than one gene in the critical genomic region.
In this proposal, we have created a team of both clinical and basic scientists to address this
question. Together, we will acquire sufficient data to formulate a successful experimental system
to define the cellular consequences of the causal genetic defect(s) at 18q23 on oligodendrocyte
proliferation, maturation and myelin function both in mice and in human in vitro models. We will
develop an integrated pipeline to perform rescue experimentation in human and mouse models
that will lead to development of high throughput assays for drug screening experiments in which
to test successful compounds on correcting or improving the dysmyelination defect at key stages
of development. For this project, we will generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from 3
individuals who are mosaic for a chromosome 18q23 deletion thereby creating sets of isogenic
positive and negative control lines. From these we will derive myelinating cortical spheroid models
to comprehensively evaluate for myelination abnormalities as compared to their controls with
genomic background that differs only at the 18q23 locus. At the same time we will use siRNA
silencing of the conserved 18q23 genes in mouse brain cells to define roles in myelinogenesis
and compare to the myelin characteristics observed in the human 18q23- model. Correlation of
the human and mouse data are essential in order to develop a live mouse model that recapitulates
the human condition and can then be used for drug toxicity and effectiveness screening in
combination with the human in vitro models. In turn, the longitudinal program of the Chromosome
18 Clinical Research Center maintains close contact with the largest cohort of individuals with
chromosome 18 abnormalities, thus making it well positioned to inform interpretation of
experimental results as well as conduct clinical trials based on findings from these results."
10808909,"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) causes infectious mononucleosis, lymphomas and lymphoproliferative
diseases in HIV infected and immune suppressed people and is linked to autoimmune diseases.
EBV converts Resting B Lymphocytes (RBLs) to continuously proliferating Lymphoblasts Cell
Lines (LCLs) by expressing EBV nuclear antigens (ENBAs) and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1)
that activates NF-kB. Since LCLs express that same EBV proteins as some EBV cancers, EBV
conversion of RBLs to LCLs is therefore a relevant model that can be genetically manipulated to
investigate EBV's role in growth transformation. LCL growth depends on EBNA2, EBNALP,
EBNA3A, EBNA3C and LMP1. Recently, we found that all the essential EBNAs and LMP1
activated NF-kB subunits converge to EBV super-enhancers (ESE) that have extraordinary
H3K27ac signals. ESEs govern the expression of key oncogenes that drive LCL growth and are
more sensitive to perturbations that average enhancers. To further characterize the molecular
composition and their functional roles in ESEs, we will (1) Determine the mechanisms through
which ESEs loop to their target genes, (2) Determine the ESE proteomic composition and identify
proteins that determine ESE formation, and (3) Determine the functional roles of ESE enhancer
RNA (eRNA). We will use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)
based assays to identify the DNA elements essential for ESE to loop to their direct target genes
and proteins essential for ESE activity. We will test the effect of eRNA knock down on host
transcription and looping factor DNA binding. The experiments here in use integrative approaches
to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ESEs activate key oncogenic divers. These
studies will identify opportunities for therapeutic intervention."

 Individual differences in brain structure, including cortical morphology and the white matter
connectome are associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. The first year of life is a period of
rapid and dynamic structural and functional brain development and new data from our cohort
suggests that a large portion of individual differences in brain structure in 10 and 12 year olds is
already present in the first year or two of life. Early adolescence and puberty is the second major
period of postnatal brain development, characterized by dynamic structural and functional brain
maturation and reorganization, and emerging risk for psychiatric disorders, though it is not known
how this period of development contributes to individual differences in brain structure and risk.
The UNC Early Brain Development Study is a unique and innovative longitudinal study that has
followed children, enrolled prenatally, with imaging and cognitive/behavioral assessments at birth,
1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 years. 482 children from this cohort are now reaching adolescence, and we
propose to follow these children at 12, 14 and 16 years of age. MRIs, including structural, diffusion
tensor, and resting state functional imaging, will be performed. Cognitive and behavioral
development will be assessed, with a focus on the phenotypes of executive function, attention,
and anxiety, consistent with RDoC constructs important for psychiatric disorder risk. We will
determine how adolescent brain development contributes to individual differences in relation to
early childhood development and whether the white matter connectome is a useful early imaging
biomarker. Knowledge gained in this study will improve our basic understanding of human brain
development, and ultimately inform early intervention strategies that prevent or mitigate risk and
illness severity.
Relevance
New knowledge gained in this study will provide a dramatically improved framework for
understanding childhood brain development and its relationship to cognitive and behavioral
outcomes in adolescence, and to risk for subsequent psychiatric disorders."

 The prevalence of myopia in the U.S. population and globally is constantly growing, increasing the risk for
associated blinding diseases such as glaucoma and retinal detachment. Evidence from animal studies
indicates that locally modulated biomechanical weakening of the sclera underlies accelerated scleral
remodeling and axial elongation in myopia. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that control scleral
remodeling and evaluate their potential to control all forms of myopia. Our central hypothesis is that scleral
remodeling in myopia is controlled by two interacting mechanisms: (i) vision-guided, aggrecan-mediated scleral
weakening that promotes collagen sliding, and (ii) natural collagen crosslinking that accumulates with age and
limits the biomechanical effects of the first mechanism. We will use our close-to-primate animal model, the tree
shrew, and innovative tools to decipher the interacting mechanism between aggrecan and crosslinking in
myopia, hyperopia, and aging. In the previous project period, we have shown that artificial crosslinking using
genipin can effectively strengthen the biomechanical weakened sclera and slow myopia progression but may
cause adverse effects. We will evaluate a new, safer mechanism to induce crosslinking using copper salt,
which increases lysyl oxidase activity and accelerates natural crosslinking. Recent findings suggest that
peripheral retinal signals play a key role in myopia, but how these signals lead to local scleral changes remains
unknown due to missing biomarkers. We will establish two locally sensitive biomarkers of scleral weakening:
direct measurements of micro-scale collagen fiber crimp using polarized light microscopy and point-by-point
tissue-scale stiffness measurements using nanoindentation. These biomarkers will allow us to (i) gain
fundamental understanding of the spatial distribution of biomechanical weakening in myopia and (ii) verify
effective biomechanical treatment with our new crosslinking approach across the entire sclera. This
mechanism discovery grant will provide fundamental insight into the multi-scale mechanisms that control
scleral biomechanics and remodeling; the role of aggrecan in myopia; the interactions between collagen
crosslinking, aging, and aggrecan; establish local biomarkers of biomechanical weakening; and evaluate lysyl
oxidase activity and aggrecan as potential new treatment targets."

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) results from mutations in the DMD gene, which generates the protein
dystrophin. Although the gene produces various sized isoforms, only the largest isoform, Dp427, performs a
critical function in skeletal muscle by linking the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoskeleton. DMD mutations
can also cause neurological dysfunction, but the cell and molecular basis of these changes are poorly under-
stood. Interestingly, the severity of cognitive deficits seen in DMD worsens with successive loss of the smaller
isoforms that cannot connect the ECM and cytoskeleton, implying additional functions these shorter dystrophins.
DMD patients have reduced total brain and gray matter volume, with mutations that affect transcription of the
mid-size isoform Dp140 being most strongly linked to this reduction16. I propose here to explore the role of dys-
trophin in the developing ventricular/subventricular zone (V-SVZ), the major neural stem cell niche (NSC) in the
adult mammalian brain. A key output of the V-SVZ during postnatal brain development is oligodendrocyte pro-
genitor cells (OPCs), which go on to myelinate the forebrain. The timing and proper execution of myelination
plays a critical role in many of the same neurological processes that are affected in DMD. Ependymal cells (ECs)
are specialized multi-ciliated cells in the V-SVZ that line the ventricles of the brain that surround NSCs and
regulate NSC quiescence and activation. My sponsor’s lab recently reported that dystroglycan, the binding part-
ner of dystrophin, modulates notch signaling in V-SVZ NSCs to regulate both NSC fate decisions and the devel-
opment of ECs24. Dystroglycan and dystrophin were also both found to influence postnatal OPC development,
including delaying white matter tract myelination. Dysregulated notch signaling has been reported in muscle
stem cells in animal models of DMD41, however, whether dystrophin regulates notch in NSCs remains unknown.
In my first aim, I will investigate how dystrophin isoforms regulate early postnatal V-SVZ niche formation by
examining EC development and organization into pinwheels. In the second aim, I will explore how dystrophin
isoforms regulate V-SVZ NSC function and the production of neuronal and glial progenitors. Throughout I will
examine dystrophin’s ability to regulate notch signaling in V-SVZ NSCs and test whether dystrophin-deficient
cell phenotypes can be rescued by modulating the notch pathway. I will use small dystrophin constructs and
DMD mouse models (mdx, mdx4cv, mdx3cv) in combination with notch activity reporter mice. Intriguingly, small
dystrophins have been reported to translocate to the nucleus in muscle cells, indicating the potential for novel
functional roles for small dystrophins in the nucleus of NSCs, which will be assessed by modification of se-
quences needed for nuclear import/export. Lastly, as a complementary approach, I will use neonatal ventricle
electroporation strategies to prevent or rescue dystrophin expression in the developing V-SVZ and use V-SVZ
cell cultures that model NSC and EC development. Together, my studies will investigate dystrophin’s role in the
formation and function of a crucial stem cell niche that generates neural progenitors for the postnatal brain."

21MedTech, LLC is developing the ARRAYTM antibiotic-loaded envelope to address the need for novel methods
to tackle rising rates of infections associated with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). There
were 1.5 million CIEDs implanted in 2011 and that number continues to grow. Between 1% and 4% of
implantations result in infection, which have potential for severe morbidity and mortality outcomes. The mortality
rate from CIED associated pocket infections can be as high as 66% if the device is not removed and up to 18%
with device removal and antibiotic therapy. To address the need for additional methods to reduce or prevent
these infections, 21MedTech is developing the ARRAY envelope for longer-term protection. The ARRAY
envelope employs a novel bioresorbable polymer film that facilitates the controlled release of rifampin and
minocycline locally following surgical implantation of a CIED. The envelope is highly tunable, enabling control
over drug release and degradation time, and has been shown to be highly biocompatible in vivo. Prior to this
Direct to Phase II proposal, 21MedTech has demonstrated safety and efficacy of the envelope material in vitro
and in vivo and has demonstrated feasibility with controlled release of rifampin and minocycline over 28 days.
21MedTech has also shown improved drug release profiles over the commercially available TYRXTM envelope
in vitro, which exhibits a burst release (>90%) in the first 24 hours. The goals of this proposal will be to optimize
release of antibiotics from the envelope, assess safety and efficacy, and to determine the effective dose in a
well-defined animal model. Success with these goals will advance the ARRAY envelope towards FDA clearance.
Commercialization of the ARRAY envelope will improve CIED surgical outcomes and improve patient quality of
life by reducing CIED associated infections."
10850682,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Monoubiquitination (Ub) of histones is an important post-translational modification (PTM) that regulates
multiple DNA-related processes including DNA replication, transcription, and repair. Aberrant regulation of
histone Ub is strongly linked to the pathogenesis of diverse diseases, including cancer, aging, and inflammation.
However, the ability to map the distribution and dynamics of histone Ub signals has been challenged by a lack
of high-quality tools, most notably detection reagents. EpiCypher performed a screen of commercial histone Ub
antibodies using a panel of monoubiquitinated recombinant designer nucleosomes (Ub-dNucs) and found that
nearly every commercial histone ubiquitin antibody is not specific for its intended target. Thus, next-generation
detection reagents are greatly needed to advance our understanding of histone Ub signaling, opening the door
to new avenues of high value drug and biomarker discovery.
 In this Direct to Phase II application, EpiCypher is developing UbSensors™, a novel class of detection
reagents that leverage chromatin reader domains to specifically detect Ub on nucleosomes to enable analysis
of histone Ub signaling dynamics in vivo. Recombinant UbSensors are designed using a structure-guided
approach to combine binding domains that interact with a nucleosomal surface (Anchor) and ubiquitin (UBD)
with a rationally designed Linker, providing high selectivity towards site-specific nucleosomal Ub targets. In
Phase I equivalent studies, we collaborated with Drs. Robert Cohen and Tingting Yao (Colorado State
University), who developed UbSensors to target H2AK119ub1, H2BK120ub1, H2AK15ub1, or any histone Ub
moiety (pan-Ub). We validated these reagents in a biochemical binding assay using Ub-dNucs, demonstrating
that the UbSensors are highly specific for their intended Ub-Nuc targets and vastly outperform current best-in-
class antibodies. In addition, we successfully applied our UbSensors to interrogate the distribution of histone Ub
genome-wide using CUT&RUN (Cleavage Under Targets & Release Using Nuclease), a breakthrough genomic
mapping technology that generates high quality data with low cell input and sequencing requirements. In Phase
II, we will expand upon our structure-guided designs and develop additional UbSensors, and apply these
reagents to characterize Ub-Nuc signaling dynamics using cutting-edge genomic mapping assays. In Aim 1, we
will develop additional UbSensors to target new Ub-Nuc modifications as well as explore various epitope tags to
improve performance in downstream assays. In Aim 2, we will further develop the application of UbSensors for
CUT&RUN by developing a DNA-barcoded Ub-dNuc spike-in panel and performing rigorous validation with a
range of cell types, sample processing methods, and inputs. In Aim 3, we will prepare for commercial launch at
the conclusion of Phase II by scaling UbSensor manufacturing and developing a lot release strategy, as well as
performing external validation and demonstrating the utility of UbSensors for high-value genomics research by
generating the first reliable maps of nucleosomal Ub signals in DNA double strand break repair."
10829377,"SUMMARY: The problem: In molecular medicine multiple parameters are combined for a more inclusive
evaluation towards personalized medicine. A thorough characterization of a patient’s tumor upfront provides
better outcomes, i.e., better insight affords higher survival rates. In contrast and almost anachronistically, PET
imaging (the most sensitive and quantitative imaging method) is “monochromatic” as it can only assess one
parameter at the time, lacking depth of information. Suitable imaging tools that allow visualization of more than
one target in patients are needed, akin an in vivo cytometry. Optical imaging utilizes multiple parts of the
spectrum to visualize several targets simultaneously, but this is not feasible for whole-body clinical imaging due
to the limited penetration of light. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can distinguish
several isotopes based on the energy of their emissions, but spectra often overlap and the required collimation
significantly decreases sensitivity. Different tracers could be imaged sequentially with PET but multiple scans
increase the dose exposure from the required CT scans. It also requires sufficient decay of one tracer over time
to be able to image the remaining one, decreasing convenience for patients. For three or four different isotopes
this requires an even more complex coordination. As a solution, we propose the new modality of multicolor PET
(mPET), which allows for simultaneous PET acquisitions of up to four different radiotracers at the same time.
This new imaging paradigm utilizes one standard (pure) positron emitter together with positron-gamma emitters
that produce triple (positron-gamma) coincidences, where a prompt gamma emission immediately follows the
positron and identifies the isotope. We already imaged two isotopes in a standard PET scanner with the aid of
the additional gamma signal but without energy discrimination. Here, we utilize the energy of the gamma signal
as “barcode identifier” for the corresponding isotope while the spatial information is carried with the 511 keV
annihilation photons. The prompt gamma requires detection without spatial decoding, which is achieved by an
add-on gamma detector with sufficient energy discrimination and temporal resolution that is synchronized with
the PET scanner. We established this system already and imaged three isotopes together. Here, we will in Aim
1 optimize the mPET set-up and then employ mPET to address important clinical/biological problems: In Aim 2,
we will dissect the tumor microenvironment, interrogating signatures important for prognosis. In Aim 3, we will
use mPET to interrogate important players in checkpoint inhibition therapy (CD4+ / CD8+ / PD-L1 /
macrophages) simultaneously over time to predict response and will explore cellular therapies by following the
injected cells to their target. The overall impact of this study will be significant, as mPET represents a true
paradigm shift, allowing imaging of several radiotracers simultaneously. We demonstrate the power of this novel
approach with clinically relevant approaches. More tracers asses a tumor better than one tracer alone, will
provide a deeper insight into relevant tumor signatures, resulting in improved patient outcome."

Dr. Maria Gutierrez is a pediatric allergist, immunologist, and rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).
This K23 application will allow Dr. Gutierrez to develop an innovative clinical and translational independently-
funded research program focused on the mechanisms of epigenetic and metabolic regulation of human immunity
during early life. Her short-term goal is to investigate the association of maternal obesity and the increased risk
of lower respiratory infection (LRTI) in infancy. Her preliminary data in 2,608 children from the Boston Birth
Cohort (BBC) recently identified that the increased LRTI risk in infants born to obese mothers is independent of
infant sex, race, gestational age, maternal smoking, parity and breastfeeding. Based on these findings, the
central hypothesis of this proposal is that maternal obesity induces fetal epigenetic and metabolic alterations that
disrupt early life immune development and lead to increased LRTI susceptibility in infancy. To test this
hypothesis, she will leverage the prospective data of the BBC that includes comprehensive clinical information
linked to DNA methylation (DNAm) and metabolomic profiles (liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry) obtained at birth (cord blood) in ~1,000 mother-infant dyads. Two specific aims are proposed: (1)
To test the hypothesis that maternal obesity alters the fetal immune epigenome (DNAm) leading to increased
susceptibility to LRTI in infancy; (2) To test the hypothesis that maternal obesity dysregulates fetal metabolic
pathways associated with the development of LRTI in the first year of life. Upon completion of this project, Dr.
Gutierrez will have acquired essential training and experience in 1) computational analysis of high-throughput
datasets used in human immunology studies with a particular focus on epigenetic and metabolomics data; 2)
novel methods of DNAm-based cell deconvolution to characterize cell-specific molecular epigenetic programs
influenced by the environment; 3) advanced statistical design and analysis of longitudinal cohort studies; 4)
leadership skills needed to lead an interdisciplinary research team and secure independent R01-level funding.
Dr. Gutierrez will achieve her research and training goals through formal coursework, workshops, national
meetings, and mentored research. Her primary mentor for this K23 award is Dr. Xiaobin Wang, the founder and
director of the JHU Center on the Early Life Origins of Disease and PI of the BBC. Dr. Wang is an experienced
mentor and international leader in molecular epidemiology who has made seminal contributions defining
epigenetic and metabolic predictors of childhood health. The mentorship team is comprised of experts in pediatric
allergy and immunology research (Dr. Robert Wood), computational biology (Dr. Xiumei Hong), and
developmental immunology (Dr. Steven Desiderio and Dr. Kathleen Sullivan). This training plan, and the data
generated from this proposed project, will provide the foundation needed to become an independent clinician-
scientist studying the epigenetic and metabolic regulation of the development of the immune system in early
human life and its long-term influence during health and disease."

Aneuploidy—the presence of chromosome gains and losses—is very rare in normal tissues but occurs in more
than 80% of human tumors, especially in solid tumors. A high level of aneuploidy in tumors correlates with higher-
grade disease, tumor progression, and resistance to therapy. Whether and how aneuploidy contributes to
formation and progression of human tumors is not well understood. Whereas genomic and clinical studies in
cancer patients suggest that aneuploidy drives tumorigenesis, experimental studies in mouse models and in vitro
systems has so far yielded conflicting data on the role of aneuploidy in tumors. Human tumors are often
specifically associated with either increases or decreases in the number of specific chromosome(s). One of the
main obstacles to progress has been the technical limitation of not being able to engineer the ‘right’ type of
aneuploidy in the ‘right’ cell type.
 Our ultimate goal is to dissect whether and how aneuploidy contributes to initiation and progression or
human tumors. Our first objective here is to generate cellular models that faithfully recapitulate the aneuploidy
patterns found in tumors in order to study how aneuploidy affects the pathobiology of tumor cells (their ability to
grow in vitro or in vivo, to evade cell death pathways, to survive cellular stress and to regulate transcription and
translation). Our second objective is to uncover vulnerabilities and synthetic lethal interactions potentially
associated with the aneuploid state. The outcomes of the proposed project will represent the foundation to
achieve the long-term goal of our lab, which is to develop a better understanding of the causes and
consequences of aneuploidy in human tumors in order to uncover aneuploidy-associated biomarkers and
therapeutic targets.
 To accomplish this goal, we will first use a panel of newly generated human cells containing different
degrees and types of aneuploidy to compare diploid and aneuploid cells for several tumor-related cellular
phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Secondly, we will adopt a systematic approach to identify genes and
pathways that when blocked, inhibit proliferation and survival of aneuploid tumor cells but not normal cells. Third,
we will perform a protein and phospho-protein analysis mainly of colorectal tumor patients’ samples to dissect
the consequences of aneuploidy at the level of protein stability and pathway regulation. Our results will fill an
important gap of knowledge in our current understanding of how aneuploidy evolves during tumorigenesis and
how we might take advantage of this knowledge to improve patient outcomes."

Stroke is a severe medical condition that affects about 800,000 in the United States every year, and 87% of
these strokes are ischemic. Recent advances in mechanical thrombectomy have substantially increased the
number of acute ischemic stroke patients who are eligible for reperfusion therapy. To further improve stroke
outcome, there is an urgent need to identify effective cerebroprotective interventions as adjunct treatments to
reperfusion therapy after ischemic stroke. Indeed, the NINDS Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN)
has called for highly promising cerebroprotective interventions to be simultaneously tested in multi-site preclinical
settings before advancing to clinical trials. The goal of this application is to participate in SPAN as a testing
laboratory to assess the efficacy of interventions selected by SPAN to improve long-term stroke outcome. As a
preclinical testing site, we will perform our assessments in transient ischemic stroke animals in a controlled,
randomized, and blinded fashion, following the standard protocols developed with NINDS and the SPAN
Coordinating Center (CC). We have assembled a strong Duke University investigative team from 4 departments
that includes basic and clinical stroke scientists, neurologists, neuroradiologists, behavior scientists, and
biostatisticians, and that has had an excellent preclinical stroke research record for over 2 decades. The team
has well established stroke models that meet the needs of long-term preclinical testing with consideration for
relevant biological variables such as sex and age, as well as ischemic stroke-related comorbidities. Multiple
quantitative behavioral tests and advanced MRI imaging are in place to support clinically relevant outcome
assessments. Collectively, this team has the experience, knowledge, skills, and equipment required to join SPAN
as a well-qualified testing site. The Duke site also has a scientific, administrative, and institutional commitment
to collaborate with the CC, other sites, and intervention providers for in-parallel testing of up to 8
cerebroprotective interventions and timely data sharing and reporting. We expect to find that the most promising
interventions, identified by SPAN, can be advanced into clinical trials, and bring hope to stroke patients."

 Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide that is involved in a variety of biological
processes, including embryonic development, angiogenesis, cardio-protection, and innate
immunity. Maternal plasma levels of AM rise substantially during a normal pregnancy, but
abnormally low levels are often associated with a variety of pregnancy complications including
preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, gestational diabetes and spontaneous abortion. Using
genetically engineered mouse models, our laboratory was the first to demonstrate that
haploinsufficiency for maternal AM causes a multitude of reproductive defects associated with
abnormal implantation and fetal growth restriction. More recently, we extended these findings to
humans by identifying the first loss-of-function mutation in the AM G protein-coupled receptor
CALCRL, associated with hydrops fetalis, placental edema and maternal subfertility. Collectively
our prior studies have defined the ways in which dosage of AM peptide and receptors can impact
reproductive success, in animal models and in humans. Therefore, in this competitive renewal we
are uniquely positioned to extend on our previous work by asking the overarching “bench-to-
bedside” question of "" How does AM signaling affect its target cells during implantation and
placentation and whether extrinsic factors can alter levels of AM to exert physiological effects on
pregnancy outcomes?"" The focus of our studies places AM signaling as a cornerstone for
elucidating fundamental questions related to pinopode formation (Aim 1), growth and remodeling
of placental/decidual vasculature (Aim 2) and the roles of extrinsic environmental factors on
reproductive outcomes (Aim 3). Using sophisticated genetic mouse models and in vitro
pharmacological and cell biological assays, we intend to further our basic understanding of
molecules and processes that govern maternal-to-fetal communication in the placenta and have
the potential of providing new clinical therapeutic targets for the amelioration of complications of
pregnancy."

Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobe that infects the colon, causing a range of
human disease including diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and toxic megacolon. The United States Centers
for Disease Control reports that, in 2017, there were 223,900 estimated cases of C. difficile infection (CDI) in
hospitalized patients in the United States with an estimated 12,800 deaths. The incidence of community-
acquired CDI is also common making C. difficile a significant public health concern. The bacterium makes a toxin,
TcdB, which is responsible for the majority of CDI symptoms. The goal of the proposed project is to define the
structural basis and physiologic consequences of TcdB binding to receptor proteins on the host cell surface. In
Aim 1, we will define the structures and key residues involved in TcdB-receptor interactions using a combination
of structural biology, mutagenesis, and quantitative binding approaches. We will use this information to generate
C. difficile strains with defined mutations in TcdB receptor binding sites. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the cellular
tropism of the toxin in the context of a human explant intoxication model, taking advantage of significant
technological advances in high resolution light microscopy imaging. These studies will be paired with
mechanistic studies in a novel cellular model of TcdB intoxication as well as the mouse model of CDI. Collectively,
these studies will define the physiologic consequences associated with defined TcdB-receptor interactions and
are expected to provide a mechanistic framework for advancing novel therapeutic and CDI prevention strategies."

Extremely little is known about neural and cognitive changes or long-term prognosis for adults with autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) older than 50 years of age, although in the US alone hundreds of thousands of
people with ASD will reach this age group in the coming decades. Cross-sectional findings suggest that new
cognitive, sensorimotor, and mental health problems emerge and that accelerated brain tissue loss occurs.
Functional and structural brain connectivity is also affected, as shown with resting state functional MRI and
diffusion MRI.
 This project aims to characterize mid- to late-life trajectories of brain anatomy and function in ASD, as
well as cognitive and behavioral change, and identify risk factors that predict poor outcomes including
suspected effects of declining GABA concentrations and excitatory:inhibitory imbalance in aging. The proposed
renewal will leverage an existing cohort (Cohort 1) of 40-70 year olds with ASD and matched typical
comparison (TC) participants. In addition, a new cohort (Cohort 2) of 50 individuals with ASD and 70 TC
participants age 40-70 will be recruited. Both cohorts will be followed longitudinally, with data collection every
3.5-5 years. Extensive data will be acquired at each time-point, including multimodal MRI scans, measures of
GABA concentration from MR spectroscopy, diagnostic, cognitive, and behavioral assessments, as well as
medical and personal history information.
 The project will pursue 3 specific aims. Aims 1 will identify alterations (and altered rates of change) in
brain anatomy, function, and connectivity and relate these to behavioral changes in 3 suspected risk domains
of Motor, Executive, and Affective function. Aim 2 will test for group differences and effects of age in GABA
concentrations and in network integration and segregation. Aim 3 will identify behavioral and neural risk factors
of adverse (or positive) outcomes (e.g. on scales of maladaptive behavior, loss of daily living skills) using
machine learning, and identify ASD subgroups based on GABA levels, differential rates of change, or
differential domain-specificity."

Mitochondria perform oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP for a majority of the cells in the body. The
accumulation of damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to a wide range of human diseases.
Mitophagy is a quality control process that eliminates and recycles damaged mitochondria to prevent their
accumulation. A majority of studies focus on how mitophagy defects affect post-mitotic cells because the first
identified autosomal recessive mutations in mitophagy genes caused neurodegenerative diseases such as
Parkinson’s. However, it is now clear that many other cell types have high levels of mitophagic activity; yet, we
do not understand the importance or impact of mitophagy in these contexts. For example, stem cells display high
levels of mitophagy, divide continuously throughout their lifespan, and possibly use mitophagy as a mechanism
to ensure daughter cells receive healthy mitochondria. Towards this goal, our findings support that mitophagy
and cell division are intimately linked by a required interorganelle signaling kinase that translocates to either
mitochondria or centrosomes to activate either cell process. To build upon this work within the next five years,
this proposal will use live imaging, genetic drosophila screens, cell biology and biochemical approaches,
transgenic mouse models, and primary stem cells to answer the following questions: 1) Do defects in mitophagy
affect stem cell division and mitochondrial inheritance? 2) Can we identify other mitophagy proteins/genes that
influence cell division? 3) Does the type of interorganelle signaling that connects mitophagy and cell division
control other cellular processes when dictated by its subcellular localization? The broad implications of this work
will elucidate why mitophagy genes are mutated in other complex diseases such as cancer, provide insight into
how mitochondrial dysfunction affects stem cells contributing to neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders,
and define fundamental signaling interactions between organelles to deepen our understanding of how cells
globally respond to dysfunctional mitochondria."
10631215,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a significant public health problem. There is a need for novel
substance use prevention strategies for adolescents, particularly developmentally-informed interventions
rooted in basic science findings. Significant basic research indicates parent stress as a risk factor for
adolescent substance use. A separate body of research finds that mindfulness interventions reduce stress in
adults. Taken together, mindfulness interventions may reduce parent stress and prevent increases in
substance use in adolescence. However, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated mindfulness
interventions for parents and none have tested neurobiological mechanisms. Through our NIDA-funded R34
(Pilot and Feasibility) award, we developed and conducted a pilot RCT of a parenting-focused mindfulness
intervention, the Parenting Mindfully (PM) intervention, in 100 highly-stressed parents of adolescents. We
found that PM reduced parent stress, increased adaptive and mindful parenting behavior, decreased parent
emotional and cortisol stress reactivity in our laboratory parent-adolescent interaction task (PAIT), and
prevented increases in adolescent substance use and psychopathology symptoms to 1 year follow-up, as
compared to a Parent Education (PE) control. In a sub-sample of 20 mothers, PM also decreased mothers’
anterior insula reactivity and increased amygdala to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity, which predicted
more adaptive parenting. The proposed study will take the next step by conducting a large RCT of PM
with a longer follow-up and more rigorous PE control and by fully testing neurobiological mechanisms.
 300 highly-stressed parents of early adolescents (age 12-14) will be randomly assigned to receive the
PM or PE intervention. Before, during, and after the interventions, and at 6 month, 1 year, and 2 year follow-
ups (into middle adolescence), we will collect questionnaire, clinical interview, and biological measures of
parent stress, parenting, adolescent substance use and substance use problems, and adolescent (and parent)
SUD and psychopathology symptoms. At pre- and post-intervention, observed adaptive and mindful parenting
behaviors and parent emotional and cortisol stress reactivity will be measured in the PAIT task. 150 mothers
will complete fMRI sessions at pre- and post- examining emotion-related neurobiological mechanisms.
 We will examine: 1. Efficacy of PM in preventing increases in adolescent substance use and symptoms;
2. Parent stress and parenting as mechanisms of PM on adolescent substance use; 3. Parent emotion-related
fMRI responses and connectivity as neurobiological mechanisms of PM. This will be the first RCT of a stand-
alone mindfulness intervention for parents of adolescents and the first to test neurobiological mechanisms. The
study will provide an effective intervention to both reduce parent stress and prevent youth substance use and
will identify neurobiological mechanisms to target and strengthen PM and other parenting interventions."
10846655,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall mission of the UCSF/UC Berkeley Bioengineering Training Program is to train future leaders and
innovators in bioengineering. We hope to instill a culture of collaboration, creativity, and productivity to support
innovative and independent thinkers, capable of addressing critical questions at the interface of science and
engineering. The program links two of the most productive and highly regarded research and educational
institutions in the nation with the goal of creating opportunities for graduate students to experience how
engineering principles can be brought to bear upon important problems in biomedical sciences and clinical care.
Our 95 faculty are based in 25 departments over two campuses and their laboratories include an array of state-
of-the art facilities. We pursue these goals through a combination of coursework, mentored research, and other
structured training activities. The bioengineering training program provides a fundamental foundation in both
engineering and biology, and integrates computational science and clinical exposure. Required courses teach
students rigor and reproducibility, biostatistics, and computational approaches in research. Skills development
in evaluating, proposing and communicating research is also threaded through the first year curriculum and
reinforced by laboratory training and mentorship. Career exploration and professional development is
emphasized from the beginning of the student experience and supported by robust program and institutional
resources, and professional mentorship from program faculty, all of whom are required to participate in mentor
development training. We anticipate supporting 20 trainees annually from the large pool of eligible students in
the UCSF/UC Berkeley Graduate Program in Bioengineering, which aims to enroll 35 new entrants each year.
Intended program outcomes include degree completion in 5-6 years, generation and communication of a body
of rigorous and impactful bioengineering research, and successful transition to a diversity of bioengineering-
related careers. We strive to provide an inclusive learning and mentoring atmosphere so that we can uphold the
same high standards for program outcomes for all students, including those from underrepresented
backgrounds, students with disability, and students from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. The
unique ability for bioengineers to integrate principles from diverse fields and thereby span the gap between
advances in basic science and clinical utilization places individuals trained in this field at a critical point in
advancing the research and education mission of NIH NIGMS."
10873058,"Thrombosis and inflammation (or thromboinflammation) are interrelated in a variety of illnesses
including sepsis or the body’s dysregulated response to an infection, and the novel Coronavirus
2019 (COVID-19). Sepsis is typically the most common individual admission diagnosis in
intensive care units in the VA system, although during certain weeks in 2020, COVID-19 was
by far the leading acute medicine admission diagnosis at our VA Medical Center and others
in the VA system. Despite advances in critical care medicine, sepsis and COVID-19 remain
as life-threatening conditions resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and a high
economic burden in Veterans and non-Veterans worldwide. Both COVID-19 and sepsis are
associated with microvascular thrombosis and coagulopathy and in both conditions, the
severity of coagulopathy is associated with increased mortality rates. Thus, understanding
the mechanisms of microvascular thrombosis in systemic inflammation such as sepsis
and COVID-19, has major clinical significance to the VA health care system. Recent work
from our laboratory demonstrate that an extracellular form of a cytoplasmic intermediate protein
circulating in plasma, vimentin, plays important roles in experimental thrombosis, and mediates
fibrin polymerization in COVID-19 and in sepsis-induced coagulopathy. This application aims
to understand the role of plasma vimentin in thrombosis and fibrin polymerization in systemic
inflammation. Our central hypothesis is that plasma vimentin mediates microvascular
thrombosis in sepsis and COVID-19 via enhancing thrombin-induced fibrin polymerization.
Two aims are proposed: Aim 1 will determine the role of plasma vimentin on microvascular
thrombosis in mice and on fibrin polymerization in Veterans with COVID-19- and sepsis-induced
coagulopathy. Aim 2 will define the role of post-translational modifications of vimentin and its cell-
specific origin on microvascular thrombosis. Completion of the proposed experiments will broaden
our understanding of the links between inflammation and microvascular thrombosis in sepsis and
COVID-19, and will provide the basis for future work aimed at preventing microvascular
thrombosis in systemic inflammation. The long-term goal is to develop optimal therapeutic
approaches for patients with sepsis, COVID-19, and other diseases associated with
thromboinflammation."
10874448,"Abstract
 Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia overall and the most common
in patients < 74 years old. In an aging veteran population, dementia is a critical health care issue that affects
7.3% of veterans ≥ 65 years old1. To prevent or manage VaD, it is critical to understand its early pathophysiology,
specifically learning how vascular disease and inflammation, a process that occurs decades before VaD,
modulate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. We have identified and characterized a novel putative
agent for vascular aging, medin, one of the most common human amyloid proteins, found in greater quantities
in VaD and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and which can cause endothelial dysfunction, pro-inflammatory
activation similar to cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), as well as exacerbate hypoxic injury to endothelial cells
(ECs). In later stages of vascular disease, atherosclerotic and thromboembolic changes can lead to ischemia
and brain tissue hypoxia or stroke, the 5th major cause of mortality. Investigating factors, such as medin, that
could potentially exacerbate this injury would lead to new treatment targets. Additionally, we showed that
monosialoganglioside-containing nanoliposomes (NLGM1, phospholipid particles <100 nm) protect against
hypoxia and oxidative stress-induced endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. Based on these initial
discoveries, our overall goal is to investigate how the aging vasculature influences neural inflammation and
function and identify novel treatment targets and intervention to mitigate hypoxic injury in VaD. In Aim 1 we will
establish mechanisms by which cerebrovascular inflammation modulates neuroinflammation and
neurodegeneration. Here we will use 2D cell, novel 3D vascularized brain organ-on-a-chip and isolated ex-vivo
collateral cerebral arteries from brain donors with VaD, AD or normal cognition to determine how vascular
inflammation induced by medin or CVRFs modulate astrocyte and microglial inflammation and affect neuronal
function and viability. In Aim 2, we will establish the role of medin in modulating hypoxic neurovascular unit
injury. We will also test whether NLGM1 could protect against hypoxic injury to cellular components of the
neurovascular unit using the 3D chip model and perform pilot investigation to test whether NLGM1 can protect
mice against hypoxic injury from middle cerebral artery occlusion. Using novel cellular and human tissue models
developed by our group, the proposal could impact our fundamental understanding of the early genesis of VaD,
identify and characterize medin as a novel treatment target and validate NLGM1 as a novel therapeutic option."
10832637,"Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, is a major worldwide public health
concern because it is often detected at advanced stages where treatment options are limited. According to the
World Health Organization, each year there are ~750,000 new HCC cases resulting in 700,000 deaths
worldwide. While historically systemic chemotherapy has been the cornerstone to cancer treatment, inability to
achieve uniform drug delivery to tumors, collateral toxicity to the non-cancerous liver and systemic side-effects
have limited progress in the development of novel therapies for liver cancer. Recently, novel
immunotherapeutic agents (immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), CAR-T cells, oncolytic virus) have been
developed, but there are still limitations to their use due to systemic side effects and difficulty to deliver to solid
tumors. Although transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), a procedure performed using an X-ray
guided catheter to deliver chemotherapy coupled to embolization beads into the blood vessels that perfuse the
liver tumor has shown success in liver cancer management, the embolization efficiency is relatively low as the
beads cannot be readily delivered into downstream microvasculature to achieve uniform ischemia and
chemotherapy delivery. Here we propose a transformative technology that uses a catheter-based locoregional
approach to deliver X-ray visible bioengineered biomaterial, i.e. next-generation TACE, to induce a more
efficient ischemic cell death within the tumor microvasculature coupled with efficient chemo- and
immunotherapy delivery. We aim to combine TACE with both chemo- and immuno-therapeutics (e.g. ICIs) in
order to enhance the anti-tumor immune response. Maintaining and even enhancing the inflammatory
response induced after chemotherapy may potentially yield improved tumor regression assisted by localized
ICI delivery. To achieve this goal we will mix doxorubicin (DOX) and / ICI (α-PD1, α-PDL1, α-CTLA-4) within an
injectable shear-thinning hydrogel (STH) to enhance tumor ablation. We hypothesize that STH, a semi-solid
gel like embolic material, which is composed of gelatin and nanosilicate, will achieve more efficient
endovascular embolization reaching vessels as small as 50 microns than the current TACE beads.
Simultaneously, DOX/ICI delivery will be used to locally ablate the liver cancer cells. Our preliminary data
demonstrates exciting results showing our ability to synthesize and deliver STHs using catheters, to release
drugs controllably from STHs, as well as in vitro and rabbit liver cancer models. In Aim 1, we will optimize STH
compositions for effective endovascular chemoembolization. In Aim 2, we will develop the novel drug-eluting
STH (DESTH) for endovascular Immuno-chemoembolization. In Aim 3 we will evaluate the in vivo performance
of the DESTH."
10834744,"This application is a proposal for a mentored clinical research award (K23) that will enable Dr. Vatsalya
Vatsalya to continue to develop his skills in clinical research; specifically, identifying new therapeutic targets for
the treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and concomitant moderate alcohol associated
hepatitis (AH). AUD represents one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States and
efforts are in progress to identify new interventions. Emerging animal and human research suggest that
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), a probiotic, is involved in the restoration of a normal gut microbiome,
attenuating gut dysfunction and lowering endotoxemia and inflammation. Dr. Vatsalya’s overall goal is to
complete mentored research and transition to independent research. He also plans to successfully obtain a
tenure-track faculty position that will allow him to fully establish his own independent research program. Dr.
Vatsalya’s training goals are to: (1) broaden his conceptual knowledge in researching the
neuropharmacological mechanisms in AUD; (2) enhance his experience with human studies in the field of AUD
and alcohol associated liver disease (ALD); (3) improve his methodological skills in order to conduct effective
large-scale trials; and (4) improve his grant- and publication-writing skills. These training goals will be achieved
through: (a) the resources available at the University of Louisville; (b) the high quality of mentorship provided
by his mentor and the mentor committee; (c) focused training and clinical experiences; and (d) the proposed
research project. During the award period, Dr. Vatsalya’s goals are to: (1) complete the K23 research and
develop preliminary data to conduct a larger bedside-to-bench study using the results and skills obtained
during the K23 grant; and (2) apply for an NIAAA investigator-initiated (R01) grant based on the preliminary
outcomes. Alcohol consumption is associated with altered microbiome and gut dysfunction, increased gut
permeability, systemic endotoxemia (gut-derived bacterial products in the circulation), and proinflammatory
activity. The gut dysfunction observed with heavy drinking has also been associated with the development of
liver injury and inflammation observed in ALD. The research component of Dr. Vatsalya’s application will
investigate if LGG can restore normal gut function, reduce gut permeability and proinflammatory activity,
thereby improving the symptomology of concomitant AUD and ALD. The proposed research project extends
Dr. Vatsalya’s previous work on the pharmacological treatment of AUD and on the role of LGG in mediating the
gut-brain axis that could be expanded to identifying new interventional-mechanistic targets in AUD."
10873034,"Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen responsible for an increasing
number of infections in VA, civilian and military hospitals. This proposal will
extend novel findings in our lab, where work has identified that A. baumannii cells
can exist in two subpopulations, one virulent and one avirulent. These
subpopulations can rapidly interconvert and we have identified a central regulator
of this switch. This TetR-type regulator is encoded by the ABUW_1645 gene and
overexpression of this regulator drives cells from the virulent state to the avirulent
state where they are now locked. Previous work identified a complex regulatory
network where a LysR-type regulator (ABUW_1132) activates ABUW_1645
expression and two additional TetR regulators, encoded by ABUW_1959 and
ABUW_2818, which drives cells into the avirulent state. Individual
overexpression of either ABUW_1959 or ABUW_2818 also drives virulent cells
into an avirulent state, where they are now locked. The identification of this
switch controlling virulence and our understanding of its regulation now paves the
way for translational interventions to exploit this switch and render cells avirulent.
First, we will identify genes controlled by all three regulators that contribute to the
loss of virulence. The role of these genes will be tested by constructing the
appropriate mutants and testing in animal models. Next, we will take advantage
of the locked avirulent state to develop a live attenuated A. baumannii vaccine
strain. Lastly, small molecules that drive cells from the virulent to the avirulent
state will be identified by high-throughput screening. Ultimately, these inhibitors
may result in the development of novel therapies to disable virulence in this
increasingly important bacterial pathogen."
10832483,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a life threatening hypertensive pregnancy disorder that occurs in 5-7% of all pregnancy
cases. Despite numerous studies on PE, there are no specific treatment options available for this disorder.
Understanding molecular factors that lead to PE could provide a basis for therapeutic interventions that may
reduce the incidence of this disease, improve maternal and fetal survival, ultimately leading to improved
cardiovascular health of the population. The mechanisms regulating feto-maternal interface during pregnancy
leading to PE are not well defined. The apelinergic system, consisting of apelin, elabela (ELA), and the apelin
receptor (APJ), is a novel pleiotropic pathway with a potential for therapeutic targeting in PE. Critical preliminary
data demonstrate that apelin reduces blood pressure, proteinuria, and improves uteroplacental hemodynamics
in PE rat model. Both, apelin and ELA act on apelin receptor and can stimulate trophoblast function, however,
the molecular mechanisms of apelin or ELAs actions on trophoblast invasion and the therapeutic potential of
either peptide in PE are unknown. Based on our published and preliminary data we hypothesize that apelin and
elabela facilitate placentation via stimulatory actions on trophoblast invasion that involve the regulation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase and mircoRNA199 signaling pathways.
We further hypothesize that the local intrauterine administration of apelin or elabela improves trophoblast
invasion and uteroplacental hemodynamics, and reduce the development of PE features. By using
multidisciplinary approach with molecular, genomic, biochemical, cellular, and physiological techniques, we will
establish the biochemical properties of the major forms of apelin and ELA, and pharmacological properties of
APJ in the placenta and trophoblast cells (Aim 1); establish the therapeutic potential of apelinergic system in PE
(Aim 2); and determine molecular underpinnings of apelin and ELA actions leading to increased trophoblast cell
invasion in primary cultures of trophoblast cells isolated from normal and preeclamptic rat placentas and human
trophoblast cell lines (Aim 3). Our studies will establish the significance of the apelinergic system as a novel
molecular pathway regulating early pregnancy advancing our knowledge on the endogenous regulation of the
feto-maternal interface and establishing the apelinergic system as a novel therapeutic pathway in PE."
10867303,"ABSTRACT. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has affected tens of millions of people but remains incurable. The
major risk factor for AD is aging, which entails high brain entropy due to the progressive brain damages. Notably,
the brain constantly consumes a large amount of energy to maintain its functional integrity, likely creating a big
“reserve” to counteract the high entropy. Malfunctions of this reserve may indicate a critical point of disease
conversion and progression. Reserve malfunction can be measured by the compensation outcome: functional
brain entropy (fBEN), which may reveal critical information for bridging the knowledge gap between AD
pathology and clinical symptoms: AD pathology begins long before AD symptoms and may not lead to dementia,
and may provide a brain marker for early disease detection. This project is proposed to characterize fBEN in
normal aging and the AD continuum and test an inverse U-shape fBEN model: fBEN increases with age and AD
pathology in normal aging but decreases in the AD continuum. We will test the model using large existing
resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. Our group started rsfMRI-based fBEN mapping in 2010 and released the first
open-source fBEN mapping tool. The tool has been widely used in many neuroscientific and translational
studies. To be scalable for large data, we will develop a further accelerated version in this project. In Aim 1, we
will calculate fBEN using data from 2000+ young and old healthy individuals from public databases and
examine the associations of fBEN to age, education, and cognitive function. We hypothesize that the brain has
a reserve-related network whose fBEN decreases with years of education and is negatively correlated with
brain function, suggesting low fBEN in this network as an indicator of brain reserve. Aim 2 will characterize fBEN
in AD and assess its associations to AD pathology and clinical symptoms. We hypothesize that there is a strong
pathology vs disease interaction on fBEN: fBEN increases with age and pathology in normal aging and lower
fBEN correlates with better cognition; those associations will be reversed in the AD continuum so that fBEN will
decrease with pathology level and lower fBEN will correlate to worse cognition. Aim 3 will evaluate the feasibility
of baseline fBEN in regions elucidated in Aims 1 and 2 for early disease detection. Because fBEN may only
reflect some part of the functional abnormalities in AD, we will combine fBEN with other imaging biomarkers in
the model in order to achieve higher prediction accuracy. We will also build a model to use fBEN to predict AD
pathology in normal aging. The clinical impact of this project includes: 1) testing the hypothetical fBEN model
will help delineate the pathology vs clinical discrepancy in AD; 2) finding the disease related fBEN patterns may
provide a potential intervention target; 3) testing the prediction model will aid early disease detection; 4) AD
pathology prediction is of great clinical value for normal aging and AD management as current AD pathology
measurement is either painful or too expensive. The feasibility of this novel project and the many new
hypotheses have been initially demonstrated by our extensive preliminary data."
10818596,"Pancreatic cancer (PanCa) treatment is exceptionally difficult due to the extremely poor response to available
therapeutic options. This poor response is mainly due to dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and desmoplastic
pancreatic tumor microenvironment. The main objective of this SC1 proposal is to establish a rationale based
novel therapeutic regimen for the treatment of advanced stage pancreatic cancer (PanCa). This novel therapy
will provide therapeutic benefit and circumvent chemoresistance via simultaneous targeting of ribosome
biogenesis by RNA polymerase I inhibitor (BMH-21) and desmoplastic tumor microenvironment with hyaluronan
inhibitor (4-Methylumbelliferone). The ribosome biogenesis is the complex and highly coordinated cellular
process leading to the production of ribosomes. This process is aberrantly operated during the development of
cancer, including PanCa and also involved in chemoresistance to therapeutic drugs, such as including
gemcitabine. Hyaluronan (Hyaluronic acid) is one of the major components of the extracellular matrix secreted
by fibroblasts and pancreatic stellate cells which is involved in the formation of desmoplasia in pancreatic tumors
that prevent drug accessibility in the tumors. Thus, strategically targeting of both ribosome biogenesis and
hyaluronan synthesis will effectively suppress the growth and metastasis of pancreatic tumors. BMH-21 was
recently developed as a potent selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase that has shown potent anti-cancer effect
in pre-clinical studies. Our preliminary results have shown promising anti-cancer and chemosensitization effects
of BMH-21 in PanCa models. 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) is a non-toxic hyaluronic acid synthesis inhibitor
with an anti-cancer property that has never been tested in combination with BMH-21 for PanCa treatment. BMH-
21 demonstrated remarkable tumor growth inhibition in the orthotopic tumor xenograft mouse model when
combined with 4-MU. Based on these compelling evidences, we hypothesize that the combination of BMH-21
and 4-MU proffers a pronounced anti-cancer efficacy due to improved drug uptake into tumors via repression of
desmoplasia and ribosome biogenesis processes. Three specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we plan to
investigate underlying molecular mechanisms and functional impact of BMH-21 and 4-MU to inhibit the growth,
metastatic phenotypes, and overcome chemoresistance. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether and how BMH-21
and 4-MU combination inhibits pancreatic tumor growth and metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model.
Under Aim 3, we will elucidate the therapeutic and chemosensitization efficacy of BMH-21 and 4-MU combination
in a transgenic mouse model (KPC) of PanCa. We will also determine how this combination influences pancreatic
tumor immune surveillance. This study has a high significant translational impact on the clinic as it will establish
a new rationale-based therapy for the treatment of advanced metastatic PanCa in humans. Successful
completion of this SC1 proposal will set a strong foundation for the PI and his research team to further pursue
an NIH competitive grant (i.e. R01 or R21) for future clinically related studies."
10606539,"Project Summary
Now in its 13th year, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium is perhaps the most innovative and productive
experiment in the history of psychiatry. The PGC unified the field and attracted a cadre of outstanding
scientists (802 investigators from 157 institutions in 41 countries). PGC work has led to identification of ~500
genetic loci in the 11 psychiatric disorders we study. Our work has led to 320 papers, many in high-profile
journals (Nature 3, Cell 5, Science 2, Nat Genet 27, Nat Neurosci 9, Mol Psych 37, Biol Psych 25). As
summary statistics are freely available, psychiatric disorders often feature prominently in papers by non-PGC
investigators. To advance discovery and impact, we propose to continue the work of the PGC across 11
disorder groups. Considerable new data are coming in the next five years. We thus can rapidly and efficiently
increase our knowledge of the fundamental basis of major psychiatric disorders.
Aim 1: we will continue to advance genetic discovery for severe psychiatric disorders in all working groups,
systematically interface with large biobank studies to ensure maximal comparability, and aggressively promote
new studies of individuals with psychiatric disorders from diverse ancestries to increase discovery and improve
fine-mapping. Aim 2: most studies analyze common variation (Aim 1), rare CNV (Aim 2), and rare
exome/genome resequencing results (via collaboration) in isolation: we will apply an integrative framework to
rigorously evaluate the contributions of all measured types of genetic variation on risk for psychiatric disorders.
Aim 3: we will move beyond classical case-control definitions to a more biologically-based and nuanced
understanding by enabling large trans-diagnostic studies, convene trans-disciplinary teams to use genetics to
address unresolved questions about the nature of psychiatric disorders, and to promote large studies of the
severest cases seen in psychiatric practice (leveraging the global reach of PGC investigators). Aim 4: we will
work to maximize the impact of our work via translational efforts: close collaborations with neuroscience
consortia to understand the biological implications of our findings; work to identify modifiable causal risk
factors; and work to robustly predict clinical outcomes and identify patient subsets. Aim 5: we will increase
impact of our work by extending and formalizing outreach to different communities (including pharma and
biotech), via digital media (Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia), and by developing, distributing, and updating
resources/educational material for patients, families, and medical professionals. We will convene a Scientific
Advisory Board to ensure we respond positively to those invested in our results
Successful completion of this body of work will greatly advance knowledge of the genetic basis of psychiatric
disorders with potentially major nosological and treatment implications. These goals are consistent with a core
mission of the NIMH, and the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically,
clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights."
11094263,"Project Summary/Abstract
 People who inject drugs (PWID) experience disproportionate risk of being infected with SARS-CoV-2,
the virus that causes COVID-19. Unfortunately, due to stigma, fear of mistreatment, and other factors, PWID are
far less likely to be vaccinated compared to other populations. African American and Latino populations also
face disproportionate risk of infection and far greater COVID-19 death rates compared to White populations, yet
due to issues including longstanding medical mistrust are also far less likely to vaccinate. For African American
and Latino PWID, COVID-related risks increase even further and vaccination becomes even more unlikely.
 In response, we propose to continue our collaboration with New York Harm Reduction Educators
(NYHRE) a prominent New York City community based organization serving African American and Latino PWID.
To increase SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among our target population, we will first assemble a community advisory
board (CAB) that we will consult at all phases of the project, then conduct a series of qualitative interviews (n=20)
to better understand barriers to testing and vaccination among PWID, and how we can potentially address these
via technology-based messaging. We will then work with our CAB and additional PWID participants (n=30) to
iteratively develop, evaluate, and refine intervention video and text message content in English and Spanish.
 Next, we will recruit a separate sample of PWID (n=500) via respondent driven sampling to evaluate
these newly created intervention materials as part of a clinical trial. Upon enrollment, participants will be offered
a free vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. To increase the rigor of our trial, we will only provide our intervention
materials to participants who do not accept vaccination when offered (based on current rates of PWID vaccination
against influenza we expect the overwhelming majority will decline). Those who do not initially vaccinate will be
randomized into one of two intervention groups: a no video group, and a video text group. The no video group
will receive weekly text messages designed to address barriers to vaccination identified in formative research.
The video text group will receive the same texts, along with links to videos we develop with NYHRE staff and
clients to address barriers to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our intervention will track response rates in both groups.
Primary outcome measures will be vaccination within the initial weeks following enrollment and the subsequent
intervention period by treatment group. Additional outcomes will include vaccination rates by demographic,
including race/ethnicity and primary language (i.e. do English speaking participants respond differently to specific
intervention components compared to monolingual Spanish speakers).
 If shown successful this approach can be replicated with additional populations that experience health
disparities, and in different languages across the United States."
10854909,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that mediate cellular cytotoxicity against virally infected and
malignant cells. Upon activation, they also release chemokines and cytokines that help prime and coordinate the
adaptive immune response. Because of these functional properties, there is continued interest in developing NK
cell products for immunotherapy. However, this effort is hindered by our limited understanding of human NK cell
differentiation and the transcription factor networks that regulate this process. In work supported by current
K99/R00 funding, we generated a considerable amount of preliminary data comprehensively characterizing the
transcriptional and epigenetic landscapes in sorted NK and CD8+ T cell subsets isolated from cytomegalovirus
(CMV) seropositive donors. To complement these analyses, we performed flow cytometry-based analyses of
transcription factor expression and ChIP-seq on sorted peripheral blood NK cell subsets to construct transcription
factor networks that potentially regulate key steps in NK cell differentiation. The culmination of this work revealed
a central role for Bcl11b. This was completely unexpected given several detailed studies in mice showing that
Bcl11b expression is restricted to the T, NKT, and ILC2 lineages and acts to enforce T cell identity. Our
preliminary results also revealed a reciprocal relationship between Runx2 and Bcl11b, with Runx2 regulating a
set of transcription factors enriched in immature NK cells and Bcl11b regulating genes enriched throughout
canonical NK cell maturation and in adaptive NK cells exhibiting a T cell-like gene expression signature. In this
application we will test the hypothesis that Runx2 is a major hub that enforces the epigenetic identity of immature
CD56bright NK cells, while Bcl11b suppresses the Runx2-directed transcriptional program to drive canonical NK
cell differentiation, maturation, and cytotoxic effector function. We also posit that high levels of Bcl11b contribute
to the T cell-like features of CMV-induced adaptive NK cells.
 We propose two independent aims to test our hypotheses. In the first aim, we will use overexpression
and knockdown strategies in sorted NK cell subsets to define the roles of Bcl11b and Runx2 during canonical
NK cell differentiation. These results will guide subsequent experiments designed to determine whether Bcl11b
overexpression in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) promotes NK cell maturation and effector function both
in vitro and after adoptive transfer into mice with established tumors. In the second aim, we will determine the
role of Bcl11b in promoting T cell-associated features of CMV-induced adaptive NK cells and test the hypothesis
that high levels of Bcl11b along with activating receptor and cytokine receptor stimulation drives adaptive NK cell
differentiation and maturation. We will also test the hypothesis that adaptive NK cells mediate superior antitumor
function in vivo relative to canonical NK cells. Results generated from this proposal will define the role of Bcl11b
in promoting canonical and adaptive NK cell differentiation, determine whether Bcl11b overexpression enhances
NK cell-mediated antitumor activity, and definitively test the antitumor function of adaptive NK cells."

This project applies advanced in vivo imaging to determine the pathological mechanisms of white matter
hyperintensities (WMHs) and their contribution to cognitive decline in older adults at risk of Alzheimer's disease

work is innovative because it utilizes, for the first time, non-invasive methods to quantify axon and myelin
rarefaction, fluid retention, WMHs-associated cortical atrophy, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction as in vivo
drivers of WMHs formation. We will also test typical pathological markers of WMHs, i.e., hypoperfusion and
compromised vascular reactivity. All imaging measurements will be validated against well-established CSF
markers. Our scientific premise is that different locations of WMHs (deep vs. periventricular) correspond to
distinct mechanisms (vascular vs. neurodegenerative) and cognitive profiles. Thus, our work will allow the use
of pathological drivers of WMHs to develop targeted strategies to stop their growth and ameliorate associated
cognitive decline in the future. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that vascular pathology predominates in deep
WMHs by measuring cortical cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. We will
use specialized arterial spin labeling and a hypercapnic functional MRI approach for these measurements. We
will validate measurements with CSF markers of vascular injury (e-selectin), inflammation (adhesion molecules,
VCAM/ICAM), and blood-brain barrier permeability (albumin extravasation). In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis
that neurodegenerative pathology predominates in periventricular WMHs by measuring axon rarefaction,
demyelination, and fluid retention using advanced diffusion imaging and myelin water fraction imaging. Validation
markers will be CSF levels of tau and myelin basic protein. In independent ex vivo samples of donor brain tissue,
we will quantify vascular pathology using smooth muscle actin and albumin immunohistochemical stains in the
two WMHs. We will also quantify axon and myelin density in the WMHs and normal-appearing white matter and
perform neuron counting in gray matter using an array of stains. Postmortem MRI will be used to identify WMHs
on donor brains. The quantitative neuropathology will serve as an independent validation of our hypotheses
regarding WMHs location and mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that deep WMHs interrupt
discrete short-range association fibers and striatal fibers, causing specific cognitive deficits, especially those
related to processing speed. Periventricular WMHs, on the other hand, interrupt long-range association tracts
causing global cognitive impairment. We will use mediation analysis to explain whether the two types of WMHs
influence the relationship between the different imaging markers and distinct cognitive symptoms. The proposal
takes advantage of the Cores and affiliates of the University of Washington's Alzheimer's Disease Research
Center for recruitment, lumbar punctures, CSF analyses, postmortem MRI matched to ex vivo tissue sections,
and systematic anatomic sampling of those sections, ensuring the success of the PI's first independent R01."

The goals of the IGVF Data Administrative and Coordinating Center (DACC) are to support the IGVF
Consortium by defining and establishing a strategy that connects all participants to the project’s science.
By creating avenues of access that distribute these data to the greater biological research community,
the DACC provides a critical connection between scientific producers and consumers. The IGVF
Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via novel experimental
assays, often focusing at the single-cell level of gene expression. This work is extended and regularized
by laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover the
associations and networks between human variation, chromosomal elements and molecular phenotypes
for the purpose of elucidating their complex relationship in human cells and tissues. The DACC’s
participation enhances the data created by the consortium through the creation of structured procedures
for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of
metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data
created, the DACC will construct a state of the art data warehouse, design and develop robust software
to enable data submission, and harden unified data processing pipelines. All experimental and
computational results will be made available via the IGVF Portal, developed by the DACC. The Portal
will integrate these data resources and provide enhanced search and browsing capabilities, along with
powerful web services. The DACC will develop tools for semantically-enhanced graph-based searches
of experiment metadata, individual genomic elements, variation and phenotype, and will implement
methods to distribute these results in matrices suitable for machine learning. Beyond computational
infrastructure to house and distribute consortium data, the DACC will also function as the administrative
hub of the IGVF. Consortium science thrives on clear and forthright communication between its
component parts, and it is the DACC’s responsibility to manage this relationship. This effort will be
facilitated by management of consortium working groups, organization of scientific results and
publications, and providing regular reporting and feedback to the Steering committee. To fully support
the community, the DACC will act as a service organization, allowing biomedical research to take full
advantage of the results from the IGVF. To this end, the DACC will organize and host consortium-
focused and user-focused meetings, and will provide documentation via many media including written
documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The various component projects of
the IGVF (DACC, mapping, systematic characterization, genetic network regulation, modeling of
genomic variation centers and groups) will be tightly woven together to create the IGVF Consortium."

10931668,"Sleep is essential for life, and chronic sleep deprivation (SD) is associated with pathology including Alzheimer's disease in humans. Urea cycle abnormalities have been observed by others in animal SD paradigms and human sleep and fatigue disorders. I found that polyamines (PAs), coupled to urea cycle by the metabolite ornithine, are elevated in Drosophila sleep mutants, especially acetylated PAs and putrescine. I hypothesize that nitrogen diversion from urea cycle to PA synthesis drives sleep when SD is acute and neurodegeneration when SD is chronic. Mentored Aim 1 will test what mechanisms link SD to nitrogen metabolism by using sleep mutants for 13C-ornithine mass spectrometry to identify the metabolites that ornithine is channeled toward, and enzyme assays to assess what catalytic differences shape the nitrogen metabolome under chronic SD. Mass spectrometry will also be conducted under more acute SD to determine if this mirrors chronic SD in PA profile. Mentored Aim 2 will test how PA supplements, and broadly expressed RNAi that promote putrescine synthesis, both promote sleep in wild-type flies. Subpopulation RNAi sleep experiments will assess what neural circuits are involved in PA sleep responses. Broadly expressed RNAi sleep experiments will determine whether PAs generally are required for rebound sleep following SD, and whether production of putrescine specifically is required for PA supplement sleep increases. Independent Aim 3 will test whether PA increases contribute to the well-documented worsening of Alzheimer's pathology by SD. Mass spectrometry will test whether PA increases observed in mouse Alzheimer's models by others, which are very similar to my fly sleep mutants, carry over to multiple fly Alzheimer's models. I will also test whether broad PA synthesis RNAi that blunts production of acetyl-PAs and putrescine can block the worsening effects of SD in multiple fly Alzheimer's models. Measures of protein pathology, cell death, lethality, and memory will be used as metrics. Independent Aim 4 will test whether PA synthesis is sleep-regulated and sleep-promoting in mouse brain. Mass spectrometry under chronic environmental enrichment SD will test whether mice exhibit similar PA changes to what I observe in my fly sleep mutants. Motion-sensing and EEG sleep metrics will be used to assess whether both PA supplementation and pharmacological depletion of PAs alter sleep in mice. Any one of these four aims has the potential to launch a long-running research project if successful, enhancing my ability to launch an independent career from this proposal. My training plan builds on my core mouse and fly skillsets, adding important complementary skills in genetic engineering, fly memory behavior, specialized mouse sleep behavior protocols, and isotopic labeling metabolomics. My training plan will also enhance my theoretical knowledge of neurodegeneration and enhance my mentorship skills. This proposal will give me the data and skills I need to succeed as an independent investigator at a research institution, building out a lab of my own focused on biochemical regulation of homeostasis, and linkages to neural pathology."
10841482,"Project Summary. In this competing renewal of R35 GM118101, we propose to focus on investigating and
developing biocatalytic systems that generate complex natural products with high potential as therapeutic
agents. This program has been highly productive with 34 publications over the past four years. Major progress
continues toward studies on the function and structure of modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) from bacteria. A
second thematic area involves studies on diverse bacterial and fungal indole alkaloid pathways for which we
have reported important achievements on characterizing biosynthetic enzymes that catalyze pericyclic (e. g.
Cope, Diels-Alder) reactions. We plan to build on these studies and also expand work on allied tailoring reactions
for indole alkaloid structural diversification.
 Our work in the type I PKS area will focus on function and structure of key catalytic domains that we have
identified to be gatekeepers in the catalytic cycle. By employing natural and unnatural advanced polyketide chain
elongation intermediates with late stage PKS modules, we plan to develop methods to expand the biocatalytic
potential of these remarkable molecular machines for assembly of macrolactone structures. Further glycosylation
and late-stage hydroxylation/epoxidation methods will be employed to generate next generation macrolides for
testing against a range of antibiotic-resistant human pathogens.
 Our work in the microbial indole alkaloids will focus on natural products whose core ring systems are derived
from biocatalytic pericyclic reactions. Mechanistic understanding of these unusual processes is rapidly emerging,
and their apparent flexibility indicates high potential for metabolite structural diversification. These efforts will be
augmented by exploring late-stage tailoring enzymes capable of further modifying core indole alkaloid structures
to generate a range of biologically active products with significant pharmaceutical potential."
10612934,"ABSTRACT
Biomarkers of aging are critical to effective research promoting the healthspan. There is a particularly urgent
need for molecular biomarkers of brain aging; deaths due to neurodegenerative diseases have increased, in
contrast to decreases in heart disease and cancer mortality. Epigenetic dysregulation is clearly implicated in
brain aging, Alzheimer dementia, and other neurologic diseases. Epigenetic clock biomarkers combine DNAm
levels across select CpG sites to estimate biologic age; epigenetic clocks strongly predict mortality, and
several are modestly associated with neurologic outcomes. However, while specific pediatric clocks have now
been developed to target biologic aging in younger age groups, no clocks to date target older populations
or focus on pathways mechanistically implicated in aging. We propose here a novel epigenetic clock, built
on ribosomal DNA methylation (rDNAm). The rDNA locus harbors fundamental, evolutionarily conserved
aging mechanisms, and rDNAm has greater association with age than any other segment of the
genome - yielding an efficient and effective epigenetic clock biomarker. In initial work, we reported an
rDNAm clock trained in mouse blood was well-calibrated in humans and canids. Thus, the rDNA may represent
a compelling dimension of epigenetic regulation, providing complementary strengths to established clocks.
We propose research constructing a rDNAm clock of brain aging. Indeed, a recent review of epigenetic clocks
recommended new development of such specialized clocks, rooted in specific tissues and pathways, to
advance research in the field. The proposed Aims utilize the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and
Aging Project (ROSMAP), with 1450 brain specimens (including a subset with blood samples), and extensive
phenotypic data. In Aim 1, we will document rDNAm states in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), and train
a rDNAm clock in 800 specimens age >65 years, to enhance applications to aging brain. We will then test
relations of the rDNAm brain clock to Alzheimer disease neuropathologic traits in the remaining 650 ROSMAP
DLPFC. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the rDNAm brain clock in two further brain regions (primary occipital cortex,
inferior anterior temporal cortex), and in blood samples as a more accessible tissue for research. In Aim 3, we
will contrast the rDNAm brain clock to existing clocks. IMPACT: Our focus on the highly conserved rDNA locus
may improve application of the rDNAm clock across tissues, while links of rDNA to aging and neurobiology
could enhance applications to brain health. Proposed Aims can yield novel tools to evaluate brain age, predict
risk of neurodegenerative diseases, provide new insights into mechanisms underlying neuro-degeneration, and
identify interventions to delay brain aging. Additionally, given the centrality of rDNA in cellular metabolism and
aging, we will add to a wealth of high-dimensional data for larger research in these Cohorts."
10850598,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a debilitating and eventually lethal disease that is resistant to
current therapeutics. A defining characteristic of PAH is excessive cellular proliferation and remodeling of
pulmonary arteries (PA), that results in progressive increases in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to right
ventricular failure and death. PAH has a survival time of five to seven years post diagnosis, and most of the
current therapies for PAH are vasodilators, which provide symptomatic relief, but do not reverse pulmonary
vascular remodeling or stop disease progression. We have discovered a novel gene, PDZ-Binding Kinase (PBK)
that is upregulated in hypertensive PA. PBK is a serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in a subset of
aggressive cancers. The hyperproliferative nature of vascular cells in PAH shares many mechanisms with that
of cancer cells, however, the therapeutic utility of targeting PBK in PAH and the mechanisms by which PBK
influences pulmonary vascular remodeling are not yet known and are the goals of this proposal.
 In preliminary experiments in experimental models and human PAH, we show that PBK is robustly
upregulated in the medial layer of PA where it overlaps with markers of smooth muscle cells. Gain and loss of
function approaches show that PBK expression regulates pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC)
proliferation. In experimental rat and mouse models of PAH in vivo, we found that selective inhibitors of PBK
improve PA remodeling and cardiopulmonary function. To determine the mechanisms underlying increased
expression of PBK, we found that the transcriptional co-activator, Yes Associated Protein1 (YAP1) was
upregulated in PAH and increased PBK promoter activity and PBK protein expression in PASMC. We employed
a proximity ligation approach to identify novel substrates of PBK which revealed Protein Regulator of Cytokinesis
1 (PRC1) as a binding partner. PBK upregulated PRC1 and induced PRC1 phosphorylation and cytokinesis in
PASMC. These novel preliminary data inform our central hypothesis that YAP1 upregulates PBK in PASMC to
enhance proliferation via PRC1 mediated cytokinesis. Collectively these mechanisms contribute to pathologic
pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH. This hypothesis will be tested using integrated molecular, cellular,
genetic, imaging, and translational pharmacological approaches in multiple rodent models including a PBK KO
rat. Our long-term goal is to define the key mechanisms by which PBK regulates PASMC proliferation to
orchestrate changes in arterial remodeling, a hallmark of PAH. At their conclusion, the proposed studies will
move the field forward by defining novel signaling pathways in PAH and a novel mechanism of PASMC
proliferation. These studies will also advance the utility of novel therapeutic approaches targeting PBK and
cytokinesis to reduce PA remodeling and subsequently improve the morbidity and mortality associated with PAH."

Silencing of transposable and repetitive elements maintains genome integrity, and defects in silencing
pathways lead to cancer formation. Despite the importance, little is known how transposable and repetitive
elements are initially recognized and targeted for silencing and how they regulate important biological
processes. To address this knowledge gap, we will combine genetics and molecular biology with
biochemistry and cryo-EM.
Genomes are under constant threat of invasion by transposable elements and other genomic parasites.
These foreign genomic elements will use the host for their own expression and proliferation. Silencing of
existing transposable and repetitive elements has been well studied, however, little is known how new
transposable elements are recognized. Although most of the repetitive genome consist of transposable and
other foreign elements, repeats of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) form a unique type of a repetitive genome, in
which some repeats are silenced while others are highly expressed. rDNA is localized in the nucleolus, a
special compartment that is considered to be phase separated by nucleophosmin and fibrillarin, and where
ribosome assembly occurs. Despite the importance of the rDNA locus, it is largely unknown how chromatin
structure at rDNA is regulated. The major goals of the proposed research is to determine how new
transposable elements are recognized and how and why chromatin regulates sorting and separation of
nascent ribosomes.
Guided by the strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue two Specific Aims to understand biology of
repetitive elements. We will determine what features in invasion of new transposable elements are
recognized by the host and which host machineries can discover those elements (Aim
1). Moreover, we will combine cryo-EM with biochemistry and genetics to determine the role of
chromatin in ribosome biogenesis (Aim 2).
Together, our proposed studies will have broad impact in chromatin field by showing how chromatin
regulates ribosome biogenesis and how insertions of new transposons are recognized by the host. Our
long-term goals are to understand the regulation of genome expression by chromatin and discover why
mutations in chromatin proteins lead to the formation of cancer cells."
10810828,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Women in sub-Saharan Africa face an unacceptably high risk of HIV acquisition during pregnancy and
breastfeeding. Daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
(FTC/TDF) is effective in reducing HIV acquisition and is recommended in pregnancy. At standard FTC/TDF
doses, however, tenofovir drug concentrations are 23-58% lower during pregnancy, raising concerns about
reduced efficacy. In this study, we seek to identify and evaluate the optimal dose of FTC/TDF for daily oral PrEP
in pregnancy, focusing on pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety outcomes. To accomplish our aims, we plan several
key activities. Dose identification (Stage 1): We will randomize 45 pregnant women at 14-24 weeks gestation
to three different FTC/TDF doses—standard dose (200mg/300mg), 150% standard dose (300mg/450mg), and
200% standard dose (400mg/600mg). Each participant will undergo three “cycles” comprising 14 days of daily
oral PrEP, followed by intensive PK sampling over 24 hours. The first two cycles will occur in the second and
third trimesters of pregnancy at the assigned FTC/TDF dose; the third will take place at 12 weeks postpartum
and use only standard FTC/TDF. We will compare tenofovir diphosphate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) in each pregnancy trimester to the postpartum control condition, using defined boundaries for
bioequivalence. Preliminary safety data will also be obtained. Independent review: Findings from this initial
stage will be independently reviewed by an expert, multidisciplinary Study Monitoring Committee, which will
recommend an increased FTC/TDF dose (150% vs. 200% standard dose) for further study. Extended safety
assessment (Stage 2): We will randomize 112 pregnant women at 14-24 weeks gestation to receive either
standard vs. increased FTC/TDF doses on a daily basis, under direct observation, until time of delivery. Safety
monitoring will continue through pregnancy, delivery, and the first six months postpartum. We will compare renal
function, adverse events, bone mineral density, weight change/growth in women and infants, and pregnancy
outcomes. We will evaluate FTC and TFV (and their metabolites) in plasma, PBMCs, red blood cells, urine, and
cervicovaginal fluid. PK modeling: Using empiric study data, we will develop a PK model that estimates
concentrations of FTC and TDF across multiple compartments during pregnancy. Our model will consider key
factors that may influence drug concentrations (e.g., body weight, gestational age, renal function) to predict
safety outcomes for lengthier exposures in pregnancy. This study will be led by an experienced team of
researchers, with extensive expertise in HIV, clinical trials, pharmacology, and obstetrics. Our proposal leverages
the strengths of its partnering institutions, including the robust research infrastructure at the University of
Zimbabwe. Over the course of this award, we will provide key insights into the PK and safety of FTC/TDF in
pregnancy. Importantly, these findings will help to optimize PrEP regimens for an important but often overlooked
population: pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa."

Corneal fibrosis (scarring) is a 3rd leading cause of blindness in veterans, military personnel, and civilians.
Globally, 23 million people have corneal opacity/fibrosis in one eye and 4.9 million people are blind in both eyes.
Currently, >167,000 veterans are legally blind, >7000 veterans develop blindness each year and 2 million have
impaired vision. The long-term goal of our research is to define efficient and safe therapies to treat corneal
fibrosis in humans. In last 4 years of funding, we made many new discoveries and successfully advanced
development including first time finding of MyoD (myoblast determination protein 1), IL-37 (interleukin 37), and
autophagy-related genes in cornea and their significant role in corneal wound repair and fibrosis. Capitalizing on
these, we propose testing three new hypotheses to advance the field of corneal wound healing and fibrosis
treatment further. Our central hypothesis is that formation and elimination of myofibroblast in corneal stroma is
a time-sensitive essential mechanism for scarless corneal repair in vivo and strategies targeting its timely
resolution will provide non-surgical means of vision restoration. Currently, corneal transplantation is standard of
care to restore vision and no-specific non-surgical therapies exist to cure corneal fibrosis without side effects in
humans. This proposal tests three independent specific aims: Aim-1 tests a hypothesis that PEI2-GNP
nanoparticle mediated localize and tissue-targeted MyoD gene silencing therapy will remove established corneal
scars/fibrosis by facilitating de-differentiation of corneal myofibroblasts (CMFs) into fibroblast cells via an
ERK/MAPK signaling in vivo in a rabbit model of wound healing. Aim-2 tests a hypothesis that dual-action IL-37
eye drops will inhibit corneal inflammation by limiting the availability of Caspase-1 and prevent corneal haze by
binding to SMAD3 in vivo in an established rabbit CIT model that shows corneal inflammation and haze
pathologies seen in patients. Aim-3 tests a hypothesis that open-field blast injury upsets corneal keratocytes’
homeostatic mechanism and wound healing properties in vivo via mTORC1-mediated dysfunctional autophagy
through LC3I/II, Beclin, SQSTM1, LAMP1/2, TFEB, & vATPase proteins. Proposed studies will be accomplished
employing established in vitro human and in vivo pre-clinical rabbit and rodent models of corneal fibrosis, actual
open field blast site; clinical eye exams, multimodal 2D/3D eye imaging, histology, molecular and cellular assays,
and transmission electron microscopy using our published method. Successful completion of project will advance
the development of novel non-surgical strategies to treat corneal fibrosis, fill many knowledge gaps, and meet
the mission of the Veterans Health Administration to provide best health care to our veterans."
10781944,"Insufficient release of insulin from the pancreatic islet β cell is a critical defect in type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Pancreatic islets are highly vascularized, and this vasculature is essential for nutrient supply to islet cells,
insulin delivery to peripheral tissues and as a rich source of signals that support β-cell function. In human T2D
and animal models, islet vasculopathy manifests as endothelial inflammation and capillary dilation and
fragmentation. Moreover, induction of these islet vascular abnormalities in vitro is sufficient to impair insulin
release and/or induce β-cell death.
 We have identified human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregation as a mediator of islet
vasculopathy. hIAPP-derived amyloid deposits accumulate in the extracellular matrix between β cells and islet
capillaries in almost all patients with T2D. We now show that hIAPP aggregation results in islet endothelial cell
cytotoxicity and inflammation, capillary dilation and loss. Using, RNA-Seq we identified Clec14a as a potential
molecular mediator of hIAPP-induced islet endothelial damage. Clec14a is a member of the vascular C-type
lectin family, whose pancreatic expression is restricted to endothelial cells. Clec14a deficiency has been shown
to result in microvascular destabilization, inflammation and cell death in several tissues but has never been
studied in the pancreas. We will now determine if loss of Clec14a exacerbates the islet endothelial response to
hIAPP in vitro and increases susceptibility to hIAPP-induced islet vasculopathy and exacerbates β-cell
dysfunction in vivo.
 Capillary-associated pericytes play a critical role in normal microvascular homeostasis. In several tissues,
including islets, pericytes regulate capillary tone and blood flow. Pericyte coverage is also necessary for
endothelial integrity, pericyte-endothelial interactions prevent endothelial inflammation and vessel leakage.
This interaction, in non-islet tissues, is governed both by paracrine signals and cell-cell contact, of which
Clec14a is just one mediator. Disruption of endothelial-pericyte interactions underlies the vascular instability
and inflammation that drives development of diabetic retinopathy and renal fibrosis. Pericyte detachment/loss
also occurs in T2D islets. However, the mechanisms that govern islet endothelial-pericyte attachment, how
these are disrupted in T2D and the consequent impact on β-cell function have not been studied. This proposal
will address this major knowledge gap. Our preliminary data show that hIAPP aggregation leads to islet
pericyte detachment and degeneration. Our data and others’ show this includes a direct toxic effect of hIAPP
on microvascular pericytes, resulting in loss of key signals that govern endothelial cell-pericyte cross-talk. This
proposal will address the hypothesis that disruption of islet endothelial cell-pericyte interactions,
mediated in part by Clec14a deficiency, underlies hIAPP-induced islet vasculopathy and contributes to
β-cell dysfunction. We propose three aims to address this hypothesis:
 Aim 1. To determine whether Clec14a deficiency mediates the deleterious vascular effects of aggregated
IAPP in vitro and exacerbates hIAPP-induced islet vasculopathy and β-cell dysfunction in vivo.
 Aim 2. To determine the role of islet endothelial cell-pericyte interactions in mediating deleterious effects of
hIAPP aggregation in vitro.
 Aim 3. To determine the impact of aggregated hIAPP on islet pericyte function ex vivo and identify islet
endothelial cell/pericyte-derived mediators of impaired insulin release and β-cell death in vitro.
 These novel studies will be the first to investigate Clec14a in the pancreas, and to interrogate mechanisms
governing islet endothelial cell-pericyte interactions under normal conditions and following hIAPP aggregation.
This work is significant as it could lead to development of new vascular-targeted therapies which could treat β-
cell dysfunction and may also be relevant for the microvascular disease which affects many tissues in T2D."
10811606,"Project Summary
Successful transition of healthy infants from breast- or bottle-feeding to textured foods requires the
development of complex neuromuscular control. This transition must also occur within the context of rapid
growth and development and increased nutritional demands. To initiate this process, complementary foods are
typically introduced by 4-6 months of age and continue throughout early childhood. Delaying the introduction of
complementary foods past 10 months of age places an otherwise healthy child at risk for persistent feeding
problems to develop well into the school-age years. This suggests that prolonged liquid diets fundamentally
alter feeding performance and the underlying oral and pharyngeal function and coordination. Currently,
however, limited data is available on precisely what rehabilitation strategy would be best to implement if this
critical window of oral sensorimotor development has passed. Our limited understanding is due, in part, to
human subject research protections in place for healthy infants and children when examining the swallow
during feeding and to their relatively slow growth rates which make longitudinal studies infeasible. The
proposed work will determine whether feeding performance and its underlying physiology and biomechanics
can be recovered following long-term use of a texture-modified diet during the critical periods of growth and
oral sensorimotor maturation in an animal model. This project will compare feeding and swallow-respiratory
coupling performance outcomes for animals reared on a texture-modified diet during early maturation and then
transitioned to textured foods using one of two rehabilitation strategies: direct transition or progressive
transition. The outcomes of these two rehabilitation strategies will be compared to normally-weaned age-
matched control animals (Specific Aim 1). This project will also examine the coordination of oral (jaw and
tongue) and hyolaryngeal movements and their motor control during feeding in each group (direct transition,
progressive transition, controls) (Specific Aim 2). Synchronized high speed biplanar fluoroscopy,
electromyography, and respiration data over 4 months in infant, juvenile, and subadult animals will provide
sequence- and cycle-level analyses across critical developmental stages. Results will enable us to tease apart
the relationship between growth and development, function, and performance as animals transition from a
liquid to a solid diet after critical windows of oral development have closed. This research is essential for
optimizing specific rehabilitation strategies for healthy infants who struggle to accept complementary foods.
This research also lays the groundwork for treating other populations such as healthy preterm infants and
children who present with underlying conditions affecting oropharyngeal coordination that complicate weaning
and the successful transition to solid foods."
10814978,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Justice-involved youth exhibit high rates of substance use and mental health symptoms, yet few receive
treatment during detention or community re-entry. Once released into the community, caregivers must facilitate
youth's treatment engagement, mobilizing significant resources and facing many barriers (e.g., transportation,
mistrust) to do so. Parenting stress, which is heightened during youth detention and community reentry, is
associated with greater perceived barriers to treatment, less youth therapeutic change throughout treatment,
and premature treatment dropout. Addressing parenting stress improves youth treatment engagement and
outcomes among youth exhibiting antisocial behavior, yet given the many barriers to treatment, novel
approaches to intervention are needed; mobile health (mHealth) technology is one promising approach.
Caregivers of justice-involved youth and system stakeholders are interested in mHealth treatment and mHealth
addresses instrumental barriers (e.g., transportation) to treatment. Advances in technology and community
engaged research allow for active stakeholder collaboration in mHealth application development, with no
technological expertise required, through participatory informatics; caregiver involvement increases the
likelihood the intervention will be relevant and efficacious. The purpose of this mixed-methods K23 study is to
1) develop a mHealth parenting stress intervention using participatory informatics; 2) assess the feasibility and
acceptability of the participatory informatics approach and the intervention; 3) evaluate the intervention's
preliminary efficacy in reducing parenting stress and increasing youth engagement in substance use or dual
diagnosis treatment post-detention through a pilot RCT; and 4) understand systems-level factors that could
influence eventual system adoption and sustainability. The overall goal of this K23 application is to provide
protected, mentored time to expand Dr. Johanna Folk's (PI) capacities as an independent substance use
health services researcher with expertise using participatory research methods to develop and evaluate novel
interventions to engage justice-involved youth and families into youth substance use treatment. Dr. Folk will
work with a team of experienced and knowledgeable mentors (Drs. Tolou-Shams, Aguilera, Knight, Arevian,
and Chaplin) to increase her competency in: 1) substance use services research; 2) participatory research
methods; and 3) mHealth methodology. The proposed research study is a logical extension of Dr. Folk's
program of research to date which has spanned the developmental spectrum and focused on the complex
interplay between justice involvement, substance use, mental health, and interpersonal relationships. This
early career development award will provide the necessary candidate training and foundation for a larger R01
hybrid design clinical trial testing the efficacy of the mHealth parenting stress intervention designed during the
K23, propelling a federally-funded program of research designed to increase substance use treatment
engagement and improve behavioral health outcomes for justice-involved youth and families."

As average life expectancy continues to rise in the developed world, age associated pathologies are
increasingly prevalent. Aging is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and the hallmarks of cardiac
aging include loss of myocytes, fibrosis and hypertrophy, all of which contribute to increased incidence of
cardiac disease. At the molecular level, cellular aging is characterized by increased reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production, mitochondrial dysfunction and accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles. Cardiac
myocytes rely upon autophagy, a lysosome-mediated degradation pathway, to remove toxic protein
aggregates and damaged organelles from the cellular milieu. Increasing lines of evidence point to an age-
associated decrease in myocyte autophagy, with predictably negative consequences for cardiac function and
health. However, it is still unclear why autophagy declines with age and whether specific proteins or pathways
involved in regulating autophagy are altered with age. Mitochondrial dysfunction is also a key hallmark of aging
and has been linked to a number of age-related pathologies, including heart failure. In addition, enlarged or
megamitochondria are often present in aged tissues, but their potential contribution to the aging process and
disease development remain unknown. We have confirmed that autophagic activity is reduced in aged mouse
hearts which correlates with accumulation of ubiquitinated mitochondria. Our preliminary data also suggest that
the decrease in autophagic activity in the aged heart is due to altered expression of Atg9b, a key regulator of
autophagosome formation and elongation. We also found that the aged mouse heart contains a substantial
number of enlarged mitochondria. Why these megamitochondria form with age in the heart and whether they
contribute to the aging process are currently unknown. In this proposal, we will examine the hypothesis that a
decline in autophagosome formation and mitochondrial clearance in the aging heart leads to increased fusion
between dysfunctional and healthy mitochondria in an attempt to dilute damaged components. Over time,
these megamitochondria accumulate increased levels of damage. They become less functional and generate
increased ROS, which directly contribute to the cardiac aging process. This hypothesis will be tested with two
specific aims. Specific aim 1 will dissect the mechanism underlying the age-associated decline in autophagy.
Specific aim 2 will characterize the interplay between mitochondrial morphology and autophagy during aging.
We will also investigate if restoring Atg9b will enhance baseline autophagy in the aged hearts and whether
reduced mitochondrial ROS production will prevent or delay the age associated decline in autophagy and
abrogate formation of harmful megamitochondria. Overall, these studies will further our understanding of the
molecular mechanism underlying the aging process and help identify interventions to preserve mitochondrial
homeostasis and prevent development of disease."

This project aims to elucidate the interactions of the herpes simplex virus portal vertex with
replicated viral DNA and the HSV packaging machinery. The packaging and cleavage of
replicated viral DNA into preformed capsids is a critical step during herpesvirus infection. For
herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), this process requires the products of seven viral genes:
UL6, UL15, UL17, UL25, UL28, UL32, and UL33. Most of the proteins involved in capsid assembly
and DNA packaging are conserved suggesting that these mechanisms will also be similar for all
herpesviruses. The proposed research by the Homa and[CJF1] Conway laboratories combines
expertise in virology and structural biology for determining the interaction of the
cleavage/packaging proteins with the capsid portal vertex leading to stable packaging of a unit
length genome. Understanding the herpesvirus portal structure and its interaction with the
packaging machinery has been hampered due to the subtle morphological differences between
the portal and penton vertices. However, recent advances in cryoEM techniques have allowed
portals to be localized in images of intact capsids yielding important structural information about
the portal and associated proteins. The pUL6 portal dodecamer appears to be anchored to the
capsid by interactions with the peri-pentonal triplexes as well as helical density attributed to the
pUL17 and pUL25 subunits of the capsid vertex specific component (CVSC). Here we propose
combined biochemical and structural studies focusing on the unique portal vertex of wild type
HSV and packaging mutants that will provide insights into the mechanism of HSV genome
packaging. We aim to understand the functions of the CVSC components, their interactions with
the portal vertex and with the terminase complex in cleavage and retention of the packaged viral
genome. Based on published and preliminary studies, we believe the pUL17 is emerging as a key
player in capsid assembly and maturation. We hypothesize that pUL17 anchors the terminase
complex to the portal and, after packaging is complete, recruits pUL25 to the portal to retain the
viral genome. We will test the hypothesis in two specific Aims that together investigate the
structure and function of the portal vertex. Aim 1 focuses on the viral proteins required for the
portal complex to interact with the replicated viral genome and initiate the cleavage packaging
reaction. Aim 2 follows a complementary structural approach to understand the architecture of
the portal vertex, include the components required for different stages of assembly and
packaging. Our results will inform the development of innovative and specific therapeutics
designed to prevent herpesvirus replication by blocking DNA packaging."
10823307,"The reproductive health needs of women with substance use disorders (SUDs) are unmet. Over 80% of
pregnancies among women with SUDs are unintended, compared to 45% of the general population, and over
20% of women with SUDs have had a short interpregnancy interval (i.e. pregnancy within 18 months of a
previous birth). Pregnancy is a unique opportunity to address contraceptive needs due to increased healthcare
access from expanded Medicaid eligibility, increased access to highly effective contraceptive methods such as
long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and enhanced motivation to avoid rapid, repeat pregnancy. Despite
this, over 75% of women with opioid use disorder fail to use postpartum contraception and less than 2% receive
LARC in the postpartum period. Currently, there are no effective strategies to improve postpartum contraceptive
decision-making for women with SUDs. To address this gap, we will conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-
implementation randomized controlled trial among 350 postpartum women with SUDs to test the effect of a novel
patient-centered, reproductive planning decision support tool, developed by the research team, called MyPath on
postpartum contraceptive method choice and continuation, continuous contraceptive use, unintended pregnancy
and interpregnancy interval until 18 months postpartum. The primary research aims are to 1) assess the effect of
patient-centered, reproductive planning decision support (MyPath) on postpartum contraceptive utilization and
reproductive health outcomes among women with SUDs; 2) determine if the relationship between MyPath and
contraceptive utilization is mediated by decision quality; and 3) identify barriers and facilitators to integrating
MyPath into routine postpartum clinical care. This research is significant because using a patient-centered,
reproductive planning approach to contraceptive decision-making represents a paradigm shift in both how we
frame and approach reproductive health outcomes among women with SUDs. Our findings will have high impact
if successful as decision support tools are a low-cost, scalable solution that can be used in most clinical settings
and our study design enhances the potential for rapid translation of our findings into routine clinical practice.
Finally, it is feasible because it builds on prior work by a research team with expertise in decision sciences,
implementation, family planning, obstetrics and SUDs."
10839983,"Abstract
Nearly half of both human and mouse genomes originate from ancient retroviral integrations. While silenced in
nearly all cells, retrotransposon reactivation is a recognized phenomenon occurring in preimplantation embryos.
In a handful of reports, disruption of retrotransposon family expression resulted in embryonic lethality, suggesting
essential functions, but the cause of this is completely unknown. The majority of retrotransposons have been
inactivated through mutation. Still, many retain regulatory and structural features of intact elements, with rare
reports of retrotransposon influence of nearby genes. The highly repetitive nature of retrotransposons has made
studying their individual functions difficult, however re-analysis of single cell pre-implantation mouse embryos
revealed striking levels of dynamically expressed retrotransposon families. Most retrotransposons are only active
during defined windows of time, sometimes spanning a single cell division. Interestingly, a subset of these loci
are spliced with nearby protein coding genes, generating “chimeric transcripts” that form hundreds of novel
embryonic specific promoters, exons and polyadenylation sites. As a proof-of-principle, a highly efficient
electroporation based CRISPR embryo editing method developed in the lab was used to generate
retrotransposon deletions of two chimeric promoters. The deletion of the MT2B1 promoter driving Rpl41 results
in delayed global translation, causing stress induced arrest. The second, deletion of the MT2C_Mm promoter of
the cell cycle regulator Cdk2ap1, results in small litters, physical abnormalities, embryo spacing, crowding and
implantation into unsuitable uterine sites, reminiscent of the human pregnancy complications placenta previa,
accreta and potentially pre-eclampsia. Thus, the applicant hypothesizes that retrotransposon reactivation and
transcript chimerism in preimplantation is essential for early embryonic development and implantation. During
the K99 phase, the applicant will train in three cutting edge technologies: automated live cell spinning disk
confocal imaging, single cell/embryo Western Blot with Dr. Amy Herr and ultra-low input Ribosome Profiling of
Embryos with Dr. Nicholas Ingolia. These collaborations and additional coursework will help the applicant master
the techniques needed for long term academic and career goals. To this end, Aim1 will serve to understand the
cellular cause of the implantation defects of the M2TC_Mm:CKD2ap1 deletion, offering insight into novel
explanations for related human pregnancy issues. Aim2 will work to elucidate the role of M2TB1:Rpl41 in global
translation as well as to gain insight into the oxidative and metabolic needs of the developing embryo. Aims 1
and 2 will be completed during the K99 phase. During the R00 phase, Aim 3 will work to determine the extent of
retrotransposon influence on the preimplantation embryo. Together with Dr. Davide Risso, parallel analysis of
the embryo ribosome profiling and matched RNA-SEQ data will help to unravel and further test the complex re-
wiring of the preimplantation embryo by retrotransposon reactivation. As these reactivations are not unique to
the mouse, this work will establish a method to investigate this overlooked but important novel regulatory network
and offer additional explanations to human developmental phenotypes that thus far have no clear genetic cause."
10738297,"Malaria is a life-threatening disease that is transmitted to humans by the bite of Anopheline mosquitoes infected
with Plasmodium parasites. Proliferation of parasites within erythrocytes in the bloodstream is central to the
parasite’s survival and results in the pathogenesis of malaria. Little is known about how the metabolic
environment of the parasite is sensed and linked to changes in gene expression. One of the major factors
underlying severe malaria, caused by infection with Plasmodium falciparum, is lactic acidosis, which has a
complex etiology, with lactate being produced by both the parasite and the host. During the asexual stages, P.
falciparum parasites carry out fermentative glycolysis leading to the conversion of pyruvate into lactate. In
addition, the host, due to aerobic glycolysis in proliferating immune cells and anaerobic glycolysis in hypoxic
cells, contributes to increased lactate levels in the bloodstream. In vitro studies have shown that the parasite
responds to changes in host lactate levels. Lactate accumulation can retard parasite growth, alter the rate of
switching to transmissible forms, and has been associated with virulence gene expression. However, the
mechanism underlying these profound changes in parasite phenotypes is unknown. In a recent study, a new
post-translational modification (PTM), lactylation, was reported in human and mouse cells, that responds to
lactate levels. In mammalian cells, several hundred proteins including histones are lactylated, and increased
lactate levels in the course of a bacterial infection resulted in gene expression changes in macrophages,
providing a link between cellular metabolism and gene expression. We have discovered this new PTM on the
tails of multiple histones in P. falciparum. We hypothesize that lactate-derived lactylation of parasite histones is
a novel histone code signature that mediates gene expression changes linked to lactate metabolism. We will
comprehensively assess histone lactylation dynamics through the parasite asexual cycle as well as the ability of
histone lactylation to be altered by perturbations in lactate metabolism. These investigations will be performed
both in a diverse panel of laboratory strains, as well as patient isolates with different disease severity. We will
also identify the target genes of histone lactylation and their association with transcriptional programs linked to
parasite cellular processes. The findings from this proposed work have the potential to establish a critical role
for histone lactylation at the fulcrum between lactate metabolism and gene expression in asexual stages of P.
falciparum, with significant implications for malaria pathogenesis and transmission."
10746453,"ABSTRACT
 Cellular senescence is a phenomenon associated with aging, wherein cells stop proliferating and secrete
factors which may impact the function of surrounding cells and tissues. Although epigenetic readouts, and in
particular DNA methylation (CpGme), have found to be associated with aging and cellular senescence, it remains
undetermined whether accumulated changes in CpGme are merely correlated with senescence or whether they
play a causal role in driving it. To answer this question, we will combine next-generation sequencing techniques
along with CRISPR-based CpGme editing and CRISPR screens to elucidate the causative associations between
CpGme sites across the genome and cellular senescence.
 In Aim 1, we will assess CpGme sites of interest for effect on cellular senescence with a high-throughput
CRISPR screen. Using a CRISPR molecule capable of depositing CpGme, it is possible to generate a population
of cells, each with CpGme modified at a particular site. By characterizing how these CpGme modifications
influence the entry rate into senescence, we will identify CpGme sites that causally affect senescence.
 In Aim 2, we will dissect how the most active sites operate to affect senescence. This will be done by inducing
CpGme at the target sites and observing how this influences genomic CpGme and gene expression profiles,
which will provide mechanistic understanding of how the perturbations we make affect cellular function. We will
develop methods to more broadly apply CpGme editing to control cellular senescence. The work will illuminate
an important process associated with aging and will provide new tools to for understanding how epigenetics
impacts biological function, as well as how we can engineer cells to optimize health in the future."
10737641,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In a 2007 editorial in NEJM, we proposed that depleting airway smooth muscle of myosin – the contractile mo-
tor protein responsible for myocyte contraction – would be an effective strategy for preventing acute asthma
attacks, but no drug strategy to accomplish this was available. However, a clever new class of compounds,
Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs), has been developed that could achieve this goal. These small,
bifunctional molecules catalyze proteasome degradation of a targeted protein by stimulating its ubiquitination.
Each PROTAC contains one moiety that binds to the targeted protein, and is connected through a linker to a
second “bait” moiety that binds an E3 ligase; when both sides are bound, the E3 ligase is brought close to the
targeted protein, which it ubiquitinates and so targets for degradation. The process is catalytic because the
PROTAC is released upon target degradation and is available for another cycle of target binding, E3 ligase re-
cruitment, and target ubiquitination. Here, we propose to test the new idea that a PROTAC to degrade
smooth muscle myosin within airway smooth muscle cells could be used as a new treatment for
asthma. Smooth muscle myosin has a long half-life and slow turnover rate and so seems ideally suited for
degradation by PROTACs. Depleting airway myocytes of myosin would drastically impair contraction, and
PROTACs targeting smooth muscle myosin (SMM-PROTACs) should prevent acute airway constriction in eve-
ryone with asthma. In this R21 proposal, we will pursue proof-of-principle experiments aimed at demonstrating
SMM-PROTACs can inhibit bronchoconstriction, through the execution of four specific aims:
 1) Synthesize and characterize a small series of prototype SMM-PROTACs
 2) Demonstrate that SMM-PROTACs degrade smooth muscle myosin in human airway smooth muscle,
 but do not degrade cardiac, skeletal, or non-muscle myosins
 3) Demonstrate that SMM-PROTACs inhibit constriction of airways in human lung slices
 4) Demonstrate that SMM-PROTACs delivered into the airways blunt methacholine (MCh)-induced bron-
 choconstriction in mice
Demonstration that SMM-PROTACs can inhibit bronchoconstriction by selectively stimulating degradation of
smooth muscle myosin would justify their further preclinical development as a novel asthma treatment. This
finding would also justify evaluation of whether SMM-PROTACs inhibit progression of other diseases in which
smooth muscle contraction plays a key role."
10835863,"Manipulation of drug disposition offers an avenue toward enhancing drug efficacy and reducing adverse drug
effects (including drug toxicity and drug resistance, the leading causes of drug treatment failure). We study the
regulation of human pregnane X receptor (hPXR), constitutive androstane receptor (hCAR), cytochromes P450
(CYP)3A4 and CYP3A5, along with their roles in drug disposition. hPXR and hCAR are nuclear receptors
modulated by many structurally diverse chemicals. They transcriptionally regulate transporters and drug-
metabolizing enzymes (including CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which metabolize more than 50% of prescribed drugs)
to control xenobiotic disposition and endobiotic homeostasis, and are implicated in drug effects and in the
development of human diseases (e.g., diabetes and cancer). Several key gaps remain in our understanding of
the regulation of hPXR, hCAR, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. First, hPXR and hCAR display ligand promiscuity and
structural flexibility, but how compounds affect receptor activities, and how the two receptors co-regulate drug
disposition, remain elusive. An innovative and systematic effort is needed to develop chemical tools to dissect
hPXR and hCAR regulation in detail. Second, how CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are differentially regulated in a tissue-
and disease-context–dependent manner is unknown. Our two long-term goals are 1) to comprehensively
understand the regulation of hPXR, hCAR, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 and its implications for drug disposition and
human diseases, and 2) to develop chemical tools to elucidate their regulation, prevent drug toxicity, and improve
drug bioavailability. We have advanced toward these goals by discovering novel mechanisms that regulate
hPXR, hCAR, and CYP3A5 (including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational regulation, and
previously unknown protein–protein interactions), and by developing novel compounds that specifically target
them. We will meet 3 challenges during the next five years: (1) The mechanism by which binders of hPXR or
hCAR trigger varying cellular outcomes to differentially affect xenobiotic metabolism is still not well defined,
hindering our ability to accurately assess drug effects. We will develop compounds and assess their mechanisms
of action and in vivo efficacy. (2) The functional relation between hPXR and hCAR and the underlying mechanism
remain unclear, preventing an effective modulating approach. We will fully characterize the relation and develop
compounds to modulate it and xenobiotic metabolism. (3) How CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 are differentially regulated
is unclear. We will develop CYP3A5-specific inhibitors, identify the regulators of CYP3A5 expression, and
develop appropriate cell models and advanced technological approaches to investigate the novel roles of
CYP3A5. Together, our findings will provide a broader comprehension of the regulation of hPXR, hCAR,
CYP3A4, and CYP3A5; define the previously unclear functional relation between hPXR and hCAR and design
paradigm-shifting approaches to modulate it; reveal novel regulation and roles of CYP3A5; and generate novel
chemical compounds as leads for therapies to prevent drug toxicity and improve drug bioavailability."
10800745,"Our long-term objective is to understand the principles that orchestrate skin morphogenesis in development
and wound regeneration. The understanding of biochemical signaling is well advanced. Yet, research into the
roles of non-neural bioelectricity lags behind, although evidence for a role of bioelectricity in development,
regeneration (McLaughlin and Levin 2018 16; Li et al., 2020 5) and wound healing (Zhao et al. 2012 32) is
growing. Our research objective is to study the mechanisms underlying the development and regeneration of
skin appendages. In two of our recent research papers, we were inspired to see bioelectricity in action in two
tissue patterning processes. First, the orientation of elongating feather buds is regulated by synchronization of
oscillating calcium channel activities in bud dermal cells, which is controlled by epidermal Shh signaling (Li et
al., 2018 11). Second, the skin frequently shows pigment stripes along the body. The size and spacing of
longitudinal pigmentation stripes in Japanese quail was recently shown to be controlled autonomously within
melanocyte progenitor populations in a gap junction-dependent manner (Inaba et al., 2019 12). At the time
these periodic black/yellow stripes form in embryos, the spacing is in millimeters, a large-scale patterning
process that cannot be explained by the classical Turing reaction-diffusion mechanism (patterning in
micrometer range). The results led us to think hard about how large-scale tissue architecture is built. While
localized signaling centers involving morphogens (e.g., WNT, BMP, FGF) were shown to initiate periodic
patterning of feather/hair buds, some unidentified mechanism capable of spanning large distances dynamically
must work together to transduce the information over the long-distance scale (Inaba and Chuong, 2019 15).
Bioelectricity work here provides a clue. Thus, we organized a multi-disciplinary team to analyze the
mechanisms on how biochemical and bioelectric signals integrate to achieve the large-scale tissue patterning.
We hypothesize, among other possibilities, transient bioelectrical signaling across gap-junction-coupled cell
collectives may allow rapid, long-distance signaling with minimal decrement. Electropotential gradients are
harnessed to propagate signals rapidly over the long distance (millimeters in milliseconds) to regulate
intracellular messengers and pattern the much larger morphogenetic field. The developing avian skin explants
provide an excellent model because of the quantifiable distinct patterns, planar topology for easier channel
activity visualization, electric current perturbation and optogenetic gene activation – not easy in the mouse
model. Experimentally, we will first gauge the endogenous bioelectric landscape and evaluate the importance
of bioelectricity in these two tissue patterning processes (Aim 1A, 2A). Then we will study how ion channels /
gap junctions cross-talk with biochemical signals to achieve tissue patterns (Aim 1B, 2B). The work is likely to
produce new findings and insights for future applications to use bioelectricity to benefit wound regeneration."

KRAS small GTPase activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and participates in cell proliferation.
KRAS is one of the most mutated proteins in cancer, with its mutations found in 98% of pancreatic tumors, 45%
of colorectal tumors and 31% of lung tumors. Despite decades of intense focus, we still do not have any effective
means of inhibiting KRAS oncogenesis. KRAS function is mostly compartmentalized to the cell plasma
membrane (PM), where KRAS interacts with a select set of lipids to form signaling nanoclusters for effector
recruitment and signal transduction. We recently showed that KRAS nanoclusters are specifically enriched with
the mixed-chain phosphatidylserine (PS) species. In consequence, KRAS nanoclustering and effector binding
occur selectively in the presence of the mixed-chain PS. Thus, KRAS function depends on PS acyl chain
structures. We, here, propose to modulate PS acyl chains using lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases
(LPCATs). In particular, we now show that increasing LPCAT1 levels reduces major mixed-chain PS species in
human pancreatic tumor cells, and disrupts the nanoclustering of KRAS on the PM. This is further supported by
cancer patient data showing that patients with KRAS-dependent pancreatic or lung cancer contain lower levels
of LPCAT1. Another LPCAT member, LPCAT4, elevates the mixed-chain lipids and has been shown to promote
KRAS oncogenesis in patients. We hypothesize that, by shifting the proportions of the mixed-chain PS
species, LPCAT1 and LPCAT4 modulate KRAS nanoclustering and function. A successful testing of our
hypothesis may provide an alternative strategy for perturbing KRAS pathology for patients with KRAS-dependent
tumors. Our hypothesis is based on a well-established premise: KRAS nanoclustering and function selectiveluy
depend on the mixed-chain PS species, whose abundance is modulated by LPCAT1/4. To test our hypothesis,
we propose 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will examine a correlation between LPCAT1/4-altered lipidomics in
whole-cell, the PM and endomembrane with effects of LPCAT1/4 on PM properties critical to KRAS function. In
Aim 2, we will examine a molecular mechanism, by which LPCAT1/4 regulate spatial distribution of KRAS,
potentially via remodeling PS acyl chains. In Aim 3, we will examine a molecular mechanism for how LPCAT1/4
modulate KRAS function in a cohort of mammalian and human tumor lines, as well as in vivo Caenorhabditis
elegans (established model system for studying KRAS oncogenesis). Here, we propose to rigorously examine a
novel mechanism, whereby remodeling PS acyl chain profiles by LPCATs modulates KRAS spatiotemporal
organization, signaling and function. We aim to test LPCATs as novel regulators of KRAS oncogenesis.
Biologically, although lipid acyl chains contribute to various important lipid bilayer properties, the importance of
acyl chains in cells, which typically contain thousands of lipid species, has not been well-understood. Our
proposed mechanism will contribute to our understanding of the potential biological roles of lipid acyl chain."

This application proposes a five-year mentored training program to develop a well-trained physician-scientist in
implementation science, infectious diseases, and substance use disorders. The multipronged training plan
includes coursework, focused research projects, and mentorship from experts in the fields of health services
research, implementation science, addiction medicine, mixed methods, and biostatistics. Implementation
scientists are of critical importance to help effectively address the global burden of the dual HIV and opioid
epidemics. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) improve both HIV and opioid use disorder (OUD)
outcomes but access to treatment has not been scaled to meet the need nor has treatment been integrated into
HIV care services, despite international recommendations to do so. Implementation strategies are needed to
bridge the gap between the evidence and “real-world” practices in order to increase the accessibility of MOUD
to people living with HIV/OUD. The integrated Promoting Action for Research in Health Services (i-PARiHS)
implementation science framework is ideally situated to scale up integration of MOUD and HIV treatment
services. It posits that 3 elements are central to successful adoption and scale-up: 1) an appraisal of the strength
of the evidence and meaning to practitioners, 2) an evaluation of the local context, and 3) effective facilitation.
The NIATx treatment improvement model is an evidence-based practice facilitation strategy designed to increase
organizational capacity to perform effective process improvement. Coaching, collaborative learning, and interest
circles are utilized and allow for a tailoring of the strategy within the intended context and needs of the
organization. The proposed research will be conducted in New Jersey, a state profoundly impacted by the dual
opioid and HIV epidemics and has 2 of the 48 counties that are priorities for the Ending the HIV Epidemic plan.
Study aims: 1) Conduct a statewide, multi-level gap analysis of treatment for HIV and OUD in New Jersey. A
mixed method study will be conducted with patients, providers, clinic administrators/directors, and key
stakeholders from the community/government to provide a multi-level assessment of the barriers and facilitators
of integrating MOUD and HIV care/prevention. 2) Using the i-PARiHS implementation science framework,
evaluate the effectiveness of using the evidence-based facilitation strategy in the NIATx Treatment Improvement
Model to scale up integrated HIV and OUD services. Using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design,
participating HIV clinics and Opioid Treatment Programs will receive coaching (facilitation) to guide rapid cycle
change projects. The primary health services outcome will be changes in MOUD prescriptions and the primary
implementation outcome will be the degree of adoption of MOUD treatment in HIV settings. These research aims
are supported by a complementary training and mentorship program and, taken together, will enable the
candidate to become an independently-funded investigator at the intersection of infectious diseases, substance
use, and implementation science."
10745740,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The American Academy of Audiology’s Academy Research Conference (ARC) 2023-2025 will be the 15th-17th
meetings of this annual translational research conference. ARC is designed for both clinicians and researchers to
take a “deep-dive” together into a clinically important research area. The SPECIFIC AIMS of this conference
series are to (1) bridge the gap between clinical practice and academic research, (2) promote interactions
between scientists and clinicians that foster collaboration and mentoring, (3) facilitate mentoring and support of
future clinicians and researchers, (4) support expansion and diversity in research, and (5) disseminate research
related to hearing and balance.
 ARC has been highly successful and adaptive to recent limitations for in-person learning. During the
Covid-19 pandemic, ARC 2020 and ARC 2021 were offered virtually, with 281 and 230 participants attending,
respectively, all while maintaining access to high quality researchers. Due to the positive response to these
virtual meetings, ARC 2023-2025 will be offered as virtual-only events.
 The fields of audiology and hearing science are advancing quickly. We propose this CONFERENCE PLAN
to address methods of managing the most common auditory conditions – hearing loss and tinnitus. Novel
therapeutic interventions are on the horizon and may provide additional management options for treating
sensorineural hearing loss (ARC 2023). Further, expanding criteria for implantable devices will offer various
options for those with less severe hearing loss, previously only managed with traditional hearing aids (ARC
2024). Tinnitus remains a considerable concern, especially for patients with hearing loss, and often requires a
multidisciplinary care team to appropriately manage (ARC 2025). Each of these conferences will provide
attendees with an expanded view of current management options as well as information on how to prepare for
future interventions.
 The ARC conference series reflects the Academy’s commitment to promoting the accessibility and
participation of underrepresented individuals in cutting-edge science. ARC’s DIVERSITY PLAN incorporates (1)
focused direction on identifying diverse speakers, (2) required diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB)
learning objective for all presentations, (3) registration stipends for those identified as belonging to an
underrepresented group (NOT-OD-20-031), (4) mentorship opportunities, and (5) childcare stipends."
10819507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Radiation therapy is one of the major approaches for cancer treatment. Treatment planning, the process of
designing the optimal treatment plan for each patient, is one of the most critical steps. If a treatment is poorly
designed, a satisfactory outcome cannot be achieved, regardless of the quality of other treatment steps.
Treatment planning in modern radiotherapy is formulated as a mathematical optimization problem defined by a
set of hyperparameters. While there exists several quantifiable metrics to quantify plan quality and guide the
planning process, these are simplified representations that cannot fully describe the physician’s intent. In addition,
these metrics only measure plan quality from a population-based perspective, and cannot guide treatment
planning to achieve the patient-specific best treatment plans. Hence, the best physician-preferred solution often
sits in a gray area, only achievable by an extensive trial-and-error hyperparameter tuning process and
interactions between the planner and physician. Consequently, planning time can take up to a week for complex
cases and plan quality may be poor, if the planner is inexperienced and/or under heavy time constraints. These
consequences substantially deteriorate treatment outcomes, as having been clearly demonstrated in clinical
studies. Recently, the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in imitation learning allows human-
like decision making by observing a human expert’s actions and internally building its own decision-making
system. In response to PAR-18-530, the goal of this project is to develop and translate an AI planner that mimics
human experts’ behavior to generate a high quality plan. The AI planner will not replace human planners. Instead,
the AI plan will be used as a starting point in the current planning process to improve plan quality and planning
efficiency. The human planner’s actions on further plan improvement can feed back to the AI planner through
continuous learning for its continuous evolution. We will pursue this goal using prostate cancer as the test bed
through an academic-industrial partnership, jointing strong research and clinical expertise at UT Southwestern
Medical Center with extensive commercial product development experience at Varian Medical Systems Inc. The
following specific aims are defined. Aim 1: Model and algorithm development. We will collect experts’ behavior
data in routine treatment planning and train the AI planner. Aim 2: System validation and translation. We will
integrate the AI planner into Varian Eclipse treatment planning system and validate the system in a clinically
realistic setting. The innovations include the use of a state-of-the-art AI imitation learning algorithm to solve a
clinically important problem, the novel technological capabilities enabled by the developed system, as well as
coherent translation activities to deliver new capabilities to end users. Deliverability is ensured by extensive
preliminary studies and the partnership integrating complementary expertise and resources. Clinical translation
of the AI planner will bring substantial impacts to radiotherapy by providing high-quality and efficient treatment
planning to benefit patients, especially those in resource-limited regions."

Low income women of childbearing age are at disproportionate risk for depressive syndromes and, despite the
availability of efficacious interventions, often do not receive the treatment they need.(1,2) We developed Mom-
Net, a remote, coach-facilitated, Internet-based intervention adapted from an empirically-supported cognitive
behavioral treatment (CBT) for depression to address the needs of depressed mothers. Two randomized control
trials(3,4) demonstrated Mom-Net to be highly effective in reducing depressive symptoms and improving parenting
behavior and child adjustment. In the proposed project we seek to examine whether we can expand the reach
of the Mom-Net intervention by implementing within the Head Start Environment. Moving Mom-Net into HS
requires that we focus on implementation processes to understand how agencies would interact with the
intervention in order to implement with effectiveness and sustainability. As well, it is important to offer agencies
delivery approaches that can best meet their available internal resources. To address these issues, we propose
using a hybrid type 2, Effectiveness-Implementation design(5) to compare two implementation approaches for
the delivery of Mom-Net, one with its existing high-intensity coaching approach, and one making use of a low-
intensity coaching, designed to provide supportive accountability, but not psychoeducational support. We
propose to follow the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment process model (EPIS(6,7)) to
guide the evaluation. The proposed study is predicated on: (a) HS's awareness of the need to identify and
respond to maternal depression(8); (b) calls to embed maternal depression treatment into early childhood service
settings(9-11); and (c) evidence of the effectiveness of web-based CBT approaches, guided by interventionists
without formal mental health training(12,13). We will (a) examine characteristics of HS agencies related to each
phase of the EPIS implementation model; (b) examine effectiveness (Maternal Depression; Parenting Behavior;
Child Emotional and Behavioral Functioning) and implementation (reach, acceptability, fidelity, and cost)
outcomes within a design in which agencies will be randomized to implementation approach, and mothers will
be randomized, within agency, to either Mom-Net or Treatment as Usual (TAU)/waitlist conditions; and (c) finally,
examine for each implementation strategy, the mediating influence of changes in maternal functioning associated
with core Mom-Net skills on maternal depressive symptoms."
10753435,"Mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers (Aac) mediate the 1:1 exchange of ADP into and ATP out of the mitochondrial
matrix, an activity that is required for oxidative phosphorylation. Previously, we made the exciting discovery that
the major yeast ADP/ATP carrier, Aac2, associates with the respiratory supercomplex (RSC; higher order
assemblies of individual respiratory complexes) but only in the context of mitochondrial membranes that contain
the unique phospholipid cardiolipin. Subsequently, we established that there is substantial overlap between the
interactomes of yeast Aac2 and two human Aac isoforms. When combined, our results demonstrate that
cardiolipin is of general importance to the extended and clinically relevant Aac family which participate in
numerous evolutionarily conserved and cardiolipin-dependent protein-protein interactions that are therefore
presumed to be functionally important. These collective findings strongly support our central hypothesis that the
cardiolipin-dependent Aac interactome represents the mitochondrion’s “Achilles’ heel” in the multiple disease
states that result from altered cardiolipin metabolism. In our ongoing efforts to drill into the cardiolipin-
dependency of Aac2 we determined that cardiolipin promotes both the tertiary and quaternary assembly of Aac2,
and excitingly, it does so via distinct mechanisms. We hypothesize that these two separable structural roles of
cardiolipin with respect to Aac2 assembly reflect specific Aac2-cardiolipin interactions occurring within the folded
carrier or on its periphery. From within, we speculate that three conserved cardiolipin-binding sites support the
carriers folded structure and potentially enable its transport-related conformational dynamics. Armed with a
series of rationally designed cardiolipin-binding Aac2 mutants, we will test our hypothesis using a suite of
structural, biochemical, biophysical, and functional analyses. On the periphery, we hypothesize that the defining
role of cardiolipin for the association of Aac2 with respiratory supercomplexes, composed in yeast of a complex
III dimer and 1-2 copies of complex IV, involves individually weak interactions between Aac2-cardiolipin, Aac2-
cardiolipin-RSC, and Aac2-RSC that when combined stabilize these multi-protein complexes. In Aim 2, mutations
will be engineered into both Aac2 and specific complex III and IV subunits to disrupt this conserved interaction
and then test our hypothesis that the cardiolipin-dependent association between Aac2 and the respiratory
supercomplex is functionally and reciprocally beneficial. In testing a novel sixth model as to the functional
relevance of RSCs, in this case those RSCs physically associated with Aac, results from this aim may help
provide a contextual framework for the other proposed RSC-related models which are currently debated. Overall,
results from this proposal will significantly impact our understanding of the consequences of alterations in the
Aac interactome that may occur due to mutations in Aac and/or perturbations in cardiolipin metabolism. In turn,
a greater understanding of basic mechanisms contributing to cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of
death in the United States, will be obtained."

Cellular differentiation is controlled by epigenetic regulatory systems that integrate multiple sensory inputs over
time to direct long-term cell fate decisions. Harnessing epigenetic regulation in the design of synthetic gene
circuits would greatly augment synthetic biology. Synthetic epigenetic circuits based on controlling chromatin
state present many attractive advantages over current forms of artificial cellular memory (e.g. recombinase or
Cas9-based switches/cascades) which can be limited in scalability, stability, and temporal control. Natural
epigenetic systems support stable memory states without altering genetic information, can induce state changes
in either deterministic or stochastic fashion, and still maintain reversibility.
We propose to generate a synthetic toolbox to regulate chromatin state in response to user-specified inputs,
thereby allowing construction of circuits with key epigenetic properties, such as memory, fate bifurcation and
temporally controlled gene expression. Our proposed circuits will be designed to a) respond to a variety of
extracellular input cues through synthetic Notch receptors, b) discriminate inputs by duration to specifically
induce cell fate changes only in response to persistent environmental stimuli, c) temporally control gene
expression programs to promote sequences of cellular behaviors, and finally d) establish divergent
differentiation states to allow functionally advantageous specialization within a cell population. Our work will
be developed in the testbed of CAR T cell immunotherapy, a major application area for mammalian cellular
engineering that could greatly benefit from synthetic circuits that incorporate epigenetic memory and temporal
control capabilities. The resulting epigenetic toolkit and circuits, however, will be applicable to a much larger
range of engineered cells, including applications in regenerative medicine and cell therapies more broadly."
10795923,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most mutations in cancer genomes are random passengers that do not contribute to oncogenesis, whereas
only a few are drivers critical for tumor development. Existing cancer therapies interfere directly with the
biology of drivers, which have been characterized extensively in protein-coding regions but remain largely
uncharacterized outside coding regions. Most tumors harbor a combination of several driver mutations, but it is
unclear how multiple events are coordinated in tumor development. The applicant's long-term goal is to
advance cancer medicine by identifying new drug targets and clinical markers for therapies in complex
pathways. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) reveal the biological role of noncoding drivers, (ii)
capture the coordination of driver events at a pathway level, and (iii) profile the effects of noncoding drivers on
cancer gene expression. The central hypothesis is that refining the biological assumptions of computational
methods will enhance their statistical power. The rationale is that defining the biology of noncoding drivers and
their combination will offer a strong foundation for new therapies. The central hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of integrating biological mechanisms into statistical methods for
localizing noncoding drivers; 2) Evaluate mechanisms by which promoter mutations increase the expression of
cancer genes; and 3) Assess the coordination of multiple driver events in tumor development. The proposed
research is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it will allow for an unbiased characterization of driver
mutations across the entire genome, address the limitations of existing cancer genomics methods in noncoding
regions, and facilitate the usage of statistical concepts for non-computational scientists. The proposal is
significant because it will enable a systematic interrogation of noncoding drivers and their combinations.
Ultimately, this will pave the way for new targeted therapies. Dr. Dietlein will be mentored by Dr. Van Allen, an
Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School with considerable experience in cancer genomics
methods that require statistical innovation for clinically focused questions. His co-mentor, Dr. Meyerson, is a
Professor of Genetics and Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a pioneer in developing targeted therapies
based on driver mutations. Additional support will be provided by 4 computational and 2 experimental
collaborators. Dr. Dietlein's training plan contains four goals, which will be pursued by hands-on experiential
training, conference meetings, and structured coursework: 1) Acquire computational skills for interpreting
drivers in noncoding regions; 2) Experimental techniques to validate driver mutations by CRISPR interference;
3) Develop professional leadership skills for interdisciplinary teams of scientists; and 4) Use machine-learning
methods for interpreting drivers in cancer genomes. Dana-Farber, Harvard Medical School, and the Broad
Institute provide an ideal environment to execute the applicant's career development plan."

Our proposed predoctoral training program “Problem-to-Product Team Entrepreneurship and Active Mentoring”
(P2P-TEAM) embraces a team science approach to research training, with an emphasis on entrepreneurial skills
and professional development. The program will train the next generation of students to flourish in scientifically
diverse teams and embrace an entrepreneurial perspective that will benefit the many graduate students in STEM
fields who transition into industrial careers, as well as those pursuing academic or government career paths. The
program revolves around the formation of interdisciplinary teams, which serve as the nuclei for pursuing
advanced research projects related to the overarching theme of theranostics, a new approach to personalized
medicine combining targeted therapy and diagnosis. The program will engage students in team-based
collaborative projects and encourage entrepreneurial efforts that build directly from translational impact (i.e.,
prospects for technology transfer and commercialization). The team-based collaboration model is designed to
increase accountability, develop peer networks and support systems, and motivate students to see their
individual research efforts in the context of solving bigger problems with potentially translational payoffs, while
the emphasis on entrepreneurship is designed to foster innovation and develop an understanding of the business
world and industry practices. The program is planned for two trainees in the first year, then a steady-state of five
trainees in subsequent years. The duration of each appointment is 2 years.
Key programmatic features of the P2P-TEAM program include (i) collaborative research, (ii) entrepreneurial
training, and (iii) professional development. The training program has 5 overarching goals: (1) facilitate the
development of interdisciplinary peer teams, (2) improve scientific communication, (3) encourage an
entrepreneurial perspective and business acumen not typically fostered in traditional graduate programs, (4)
develop project management skills, and (5) enhance professional training (soft skills). Specific activities include
training in translation of research problems into products; participation in professional development, statistical
informatics, and entrepreneurship courses; activities to build networking and scientific communication skills;
creation of an annual prospectus; and engagement in industrial internships. Industrial mentors will provide insight
into the business aspects related to assessment of technology development arising from the collaborative
research projects. The frontier field of theranostics provides avenues for both basic and applied research
projects, as well as natural translation to commercialization opportunities, making it an ideal focus of the
proposed training program. Because of its interdisciplinary and translational research approach, our program will
be an avenue for recruiting and retaining highly innovative graduate students from diverse backgrounds."
10912441,"Project Abstract
Specialized synaptic wiring motifs have been suspected to be essential building blocks of cognition since the
birth of modern neuroscience. However the technology to test these ideas has been historically unavailable.
The grid cell system in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), a deep brain area, is an exemplar of this problem. Grid
cells are essential for memory and navigation. They are thought to be key in the development of Alzheimer’s
disease. Yet the fundamental mechanisms underlying grid cell activity are not understood, owing to technical
barriers in assessing grid cells’ wiring patterns. Here I propose to overcome these barriers, by developing a
pipeline for circuit reconstruction of functionally-characterized neurons in deep brain areas. My dissertation
work thus far (Aim 1) has involved co-development of such a pipeline for surface brain areas, then adaptation
of this procedure for deep brain areas, using a combination of implantable optics, multiphoton calcium imaging
during behavior, electron microscopy, and multimodal techniques to register both functional and anatomical
data. During the independent phase (F99, Aim 2), I will apply this pipeline to grid cells in MEC, enabling
definitive refutation or confirmation of the wiring patterns predicted by current theories of grid cell function. I
then provide a postdoctoral plan (K00, Aim 3) for the creation of next-generation multiphoton imaging and
rodent behavioral technology. This postdoctoral training at the interface of optical design and engineering
methods aims to expand current capabilities for monitoring neural activity, reconstructing neural circuits, and
testing theories of brain function. Overall this proposal will enable me to develop skills in circuit reconstruction
and methods development for neuroscience, enhancing the probability of a career as an independent
investigator in academia. Finally, I anticipate that the proposed studies will advance technical capabilities for
neuroscience, and provide fundamental insight into the circuit architectures underlying memory and cognition
in a brain circuit highly relevant to pressing health needs."
10619211,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 What fascinates me is the ability of the nervous system to mediate our adaptive responses to our
changing environment and our changing behavioral states. As an entry point into this phenomenon, in my
graduate training, I’ve used the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) to build expertise in applying
genetic and molecular analysis to understand how neural circuitry is adapted downstream of physiological
input. In this context, at the cellular level, I’ve been most curious as to how neurons and their targets adapt
highly specialized and complementary cellular morphologies during synaptic morphogenesis (SM). At the
molecular level, neural activity initiates the deployment of calcium-dependent transcriptional and post-
transcriptional programs that regulate synaptic morphology and organization. After learning about factors that
control local translation within the synaptic compartment, such as the fragile X mental retardation protein
(FMRP), I became very interested in post-transcriptional control of SM. Mechanistically, I am interested in
how the translation of individual genes is controlled downstream of neural-activity during SM, which lead me
to studying miRNAs. In my dissertation work thus far, I have identified several miRNAs as essential for activity-
dependent morphogenesis of the NMJ terminal including miR-973. MiR-973 loss of function revealed a novel
phenotype and suggested that it is required for activity-dependent synapse stability.
 Through these efforts, I have developed a sound understanding of approaches to characterize changes
in synaptic architecture and plasticity. I will build upon this skill set in the F99 phase of this proposal by using
optogenetics, ribosome profiling, and genetic approaches to resolve the mechanistic contribution of miR-973
in synaptic stability at the NMJ. Concurrently, I have developed a training plan with my sponsor and co-
sponsor to ensure that I am actively thinking about the broader relevance of my work to synaptic plasticity in
mammalian systems. Collectively, training during the F99 phase will provide a solid foundation that will enable
me to construct effective experimental approaches to studying neural plasticity in a broad range of contexts.
Moving forward, I will be in great position to transition into the K00 phase where I will apply my expertise in
synaptic morphogenesis to exercise-mediated neural plasticity in the adult mammalian brain. My ultimate goal
is to utilize this approach to identify novel molecular pathways and signaling factors that mediate neural
plasticity as potential targets for therapeutic applications, which aligns with the Brain Initiative on
Neurotherapeutics and Mechanisms shaping neuronal circuitry."
10828331,"The Administrative Core focuses on the following four aims: governance, membership,
collaboration, and emergency preparedness. The RML will prioritize a cooperative and
collaborative governance model that ensures education, funding, and engagement activities will
be responsive to the evolving health information needs of the Region, United States, and NNLM.
Staffing the RML will include a director, associate director, five experienced librarians, and a
communications and finance coordinator. Governance of the RML will include seven State
Stakeholder Advisory Groups consisting of a diverse and inclusive group of professionals with
expertise in a range of focus areas that align with NNLM’s target audiences, goals, and,
priorities. These Advisory Groups will establish a bidirectional communication channel within
each state and create state action plans to guide programming and services. An expanded
Partner Outreach Program will establish a “field force” of trusted NNLM ambassadors within
each state to provide greater exposure to NLM and NNLM products and services. This
community-led model will expand NNLM’s presence in the many rural and urban areas spread
out across Region 6. Both the State Stakeholder Advisory Groups and Partner Outreach
participants will contribute to membership promotion, recruitment, and engagement. Region 6
will utilize direct outreach, targeted mailings, membership kits, and membership campaigns to
recruit and engage Network members. Staff will also work cooperatively with NLM’s Office of
Engagement and Training (OET) and other RMLs, Offices, and Centers to implement best
practices regarding membership recruitment and engagement. This cooperation will extend
beyond membership into all facets of NNLM work. Region 6 staff will actively participate on
NNLM Working Groups and engage with coordinators across RMLs to identify opportunities to
develop national programming that can be delivered regionally, and vice versa. The Network
Coordinator will oversee the RML’s Emergency Preparedness and Response activities, including
the coordination of state liaisons and e-newsletter development. The Associate Director will
work with OET and other RMLs to establish protocols to ensure continuity of services in the
event that an emergency disrupts services."
10828335,"The Program Core focuses on the following four aims: community-based outreach, workforce
development, technology access, and evaluation. Region 6 recognizes the importance of utilizing
community-driven approaches to engage underrepresented populations across the Region. A
core focus of Region 6’s community-based outreach plan will be an enhanced subaward program
for outreach to underrepresented populations. This program will provide targeted outreach to
Medically Underserved Areas (MUA), collaborations with the Region’s Advisory Groups and
Partner Outreach Program, and oversight by the Community Outreach Coordinator. The goal of
this program will be to foster meaningful engagement between Network members and build
capacity and trust through community-led initiatives. Awards made as part of this program will
have a direct impact on NNLM’s goals to promote health literacy and address health equity
through information. A health literacy summit will also be coordinated by the RML to further
build capacity across the Region. Beyond the health literacy summit, the RML is structured to
support a diverse workforce with various training needs. An education and outreach team will
develop and deliver trainings and other programming activities for librarians and library and
information science students; public health and other health professionals; and public librarians
and staff. Each target audience will require coordinators to assess, develop, deliver, and evaluate
activities to ensure the needs of NNLM’s diverse audiences are being met. Funding
opportunities will be offered to support professional development and establish relationships
across NNLM members. Funding support will also be made to organizations that operate in
MUAs and struggle with access to broadband internet. As part of its technology improvement
plan, Region 6 staff will also seek partnerships with organizations across the Region that can
further address digital inequities by incorporating digital health components. The RML will be
guided by a logic model, to be developed in collaboration with the NNLM National Evaluation
Center, and continuous evaluation throughout the five-year cooperative agreement will enable
data-driven decision-making regarding programming activities."
10873035,"In critically ill patients, anemia is a well-established risk factor for poor outcomes but, paradoxically, liberal RBC
transfusion in these patients does not improve outcomes as compared with a restrictive strategy in which patients
remain moderately anemic. Changes taking place very early in the storage process may contribute by impairing
RBC function. We have identified functional and biochemical changes in the first day of RBC storage that
contribute to a proadhesive effect of blood banking. Most recently, we identified a novel mechanism whereby
healthy human RBCs export the nitric oxide (NO) derivative, S-nitrosothiol (SNO), to oppose endothelial
adhesion of RBCs in vitro and in vivo in mice. This RBC SNO export is depressed after RBC storage. To study
the physiological significance of this pathway, we engineered a mouse in which the responsible SNO transporter
is inducibly deleted from endothelial cells. ECs from this mouse import SNO poorly as predicted, and RBC
adhesion is increased in the lungs of these mice after transfusion. In mice with sepsis (injurious response to
serious infection), we find that RBC export of SNO is decreased even though RBC SNO content is elevated. We
hypothesize that in sepsis, intercellular SNO transport is deficient, promoting the adhesivity of RBCs (native or
transfused) and neutrophils. We will test this hypothesis by accomplishing these Specific Aims:
1. Determine the influence of sepsis on antiadhesive SNO export from RBCs. We find that after cecal
ligation and puncture (CLP), the ability of murine RBCs to export antiadhesive SNO is deficient. We will test
whether the SNO deficiency and proadhesive effect in this sepsis model are related, such as by testing rescue
using extracellular CSNO (S-nitrosocysteine). We will test whether SNO export by one RBC population can
influence the adhesivity of other RBCs in paracrine fashion. The relevance to human sepsis in Veterans will be
tested by studying the LAT1-dependent ability of patient RBCs to export SNO basally and in hypoxia.
2. Determine the influence of LAT1-mediated SNO export on neutrophil adhesion. Neutrophil adhesion to
the endothelium is a key early event in immune responses to infection. Antiadhesive NO/SNO is abundant in
sepsis and may limit organ damage. We will determine the role of LAT1 and SNO export in modulating the
adhesivity of neutrophils. We will determine the role of RBC SNO export in modulating the adhesion of
neutrophils. We will identify the adhesion receptors and counterreceptors mediating LAT1/SNO-sensitive
neutrophil adhesion. Finally, we will determine the role of LAT1-mediated SNO export (and EC SNO import) in
the adhesivity of adoptively transferred neutrophils.
3. Determine the role of SNO export by RBCs and neutrophils in adhesion and extravasation in a mouse
model of CLP-induced sepsis. We will measure the adhesion of both RBCs and neutrophils, and indices of
organ injury, in sepsis secondary to CLP in our mice conditionally deficient in EC LAT1. We will determine the
influence in septic (post-CLP) mice of autologous or heterologous RBC transfusion as a function of SNO export
competence (LAT1 deletion or inhibitors). Given our demonstration that the proadhesive effect of RBC storage
can be mitigated by RBC renitrosylation, we will investigate the influence of RBC SNO augmentation in a mouse
model of sepsis (CLP)-induced cellular adhesion and organ injury.
Numerous supportive and other therapies have failed in sepsis, including RBC transfusion for anemia, a
clinically significant comorbidity in sepsis. Our innovative mechanistic focus on altered intercellular SNO
transport, facilitates the identification of translatable solutions made possible in the form of vehicle RBC
transfusates."
10875755,"The ultimate goal of this study is to advance our understanding of the complexity of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) pathophysiology and to provide invaluable preclinical information on new treatment strategies. Sporadic
AD involves multiple genetic risk factors. One of the top genetic risk factors for AD is SORL1; association
between genetic variants of SORL1 and late-onset AD has been repeatedly revealed in genome-wide
association studies. Furthermore, nonsense and missense mutations of SORL1 cause autosomal dominant
early-onset AD, supporting an etiological role of this gene in AD. SORL1 encodes the sorting-related receptor
with A repeat (SORLA) protein, which exhibits a protective role in AD pathogenesis through regulation of
endocytic function and amyloid β (Aβ) metabolism. Despite its importance in AD pathogenesis, our knowledge
of how SORLA is regulated by intracellular signaling molecules and the relevance of this regulation to AD is
surprisingly scarce. In our preliminary studies, we identified a novel interaction between SORLA and βarrestin2
(βARR2), a multifunctional trafficking/signaling adaptor that is potentially involved in AD. Our preliminary data
suggest that βARR2 disrupts retromer-mediated retrograde transport of SORLA and reduces SORLA stability.
Furthermore, we found a significant increase in the SORLA-βARR2 interaction, which correlates with a decrease
in the SORLA-retromer interaction, in postmortem brain tissues of AD subjects when compared to controls.
Therefore, we discovered a novel βARR2-dependent regulation of SORLA trafficking and stability that is relevant
to AD. In this proposal, we will determine the pathophysiological significance and underlying mechanism of this
novel regulation and use preclinical tests to explore its potential as a therapeutic target for AD. In Aim 1, we will
determine how βARR2 alters SORLA trafficking and stability to disrupt the endosome network and Aβ
metabolism. In Aim 2, we will test how this βARR2-dependent regulation of SORLA is modulated by intracellular
signaling. In Aim 3, we will explore the therapeutic potential of targeting this novel regulatory pathway in
ameliorating AD-related deficits using animal models."

The goals of this training program entitled “Predoctoral Training in Cross-disciplinary Molecular and Cellular
Biology” (CMCB) at Brandeis University are to produce rigorous, quantitative scientists with expertise in multiple
disciplines, to provide trainees with the skills needed to succeed in diverse science-related careers, and to help
trainees explore and pursue their career interests in an informed manner. This new program combines the
complementary strengths of two prior Brandeis T32 programs: “Genetic and Biochemical Mechanisms of
Regulation, T32GM007122”, expiring after >40 years of NIGMS support, and “Quantitative Biology,
T32EB009419”, expiring after 10 years of NIBIB support. While both training programs had strong track
records of student research productivity and career outcomes, we significantly rethought and revised core
elements of training (based on student and faculty feedback) to better prepare students for a future in which
interdisciplinary research is increasingly crucial. Innovations include: (1) increased quantitative training,
through courses and an annual workshop, (2) revising the timing and goal of the qualifying exam, both to
improve the training value and to better serve students from diverse scientific and personal backgrounds, (3)
earlier implementation of Individual Development Plans and Thesis Committee Meetings to accelerate trainee
career development and research progress, (4) introducing a secondary research advisor in a complementary
discipline to facilitate interdisciplinary training, (5) a two week professional Externship in Year 4+, (6) new
program self-assessment mechanisms, including semi-annual trainee feedback and the creation of an External
Advisory Committee, and (7) formal training in and oversight of mentoring for all training faculty. Trainee
appointments will be made at the end of Year 1, after students have completed one year of coursework, four 9-
week laboratory rotations, and chosen a lab. In Year 2, trainees serve as teaching assistants for one course per
semester, take a Proseminar course to help them craft their thesis research plan and defend it at their qualifying
exam (end of Year 2), and to develop a career Individual Development Plan (IDP). In Year 3+, trainees take a
final elective and focus on their research. They present their work at annual Departmental talks, have annual
Thesis Committee Meetings focused on career planning and research progress. In Year 4+, they engage in a
two-week career Externship and serve as mentors at the annual Quantitative Analysis workshop. Program
outcomes and success will be measured by: (1) sustained research impact (reflected in trainee publications),
(2) development of independent scientific thinking and communication (assessed through thesis proposals,
annual Departmental talks and Thesis Committee Meetings), (3) active trainee engagement in their own career
development (reflected in annual IDPs, discussions at Thesis Committee Meetings, and the new Externship
program), and (4) trainee placement and long-term success in science-related careers. There are 29 CMCB
training faculty, and 12 slots are requested (~6 trainees/year, with trainees supported in Years 2 and 3)."
10843189,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The phagocytes of the immune system require a rapid burst of energy to phagocytose and kill pathogens in a timely
manner. Energy demanding macromolecular complexes such as vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) and NADPH
oxidase (NOX) complexes are recruited to the phagosome to acidify, oxidize, kill, and digest the pathogenic cargo.
Reprogramming of the metabolic machinery by gene expression is too slow to meet the sharply increased demand
for energy and metabolites. How do the sentinel phagocytes transmit the recognition of pathogens to switch the
primary gears of cellular metabolism so rapidly? Our preliminary data indicated that the Ca2+-selective,
mitochondrial ion channel, MCU, plays a crucial role in the signaling circuits that rapidly connect the sensory
receptors of pathogens to the metabolic outputs necessary for phagosomal killing. Pursuing these tantalizing leads
has now laid a strong scientific foundation to hypothesize that assembly of phagosome-mitochondria proximity
architecture (PMPA) and mitochondrial Ca2+-signaling fuels cell-intrinsic immunity. In Aim1, we define the
mechanisms underlying mitochondria-phagosome interactions triggered by C. albicans. In Aim 2, we define
mechanisms through which mCa2+-signaling is regulated in activated macrophages. In Aim 3, we define the key
metabolic outputs of mCa2+-signaling that drive microbial killing. This research is conceptually innovative because
it unravels fascinating new connections between pathogen mitochondrial physiology, immunometabolism and
microbial killing. Innovations include tools to monitor mCa2+-elevations in primary macrophages executing
phagocytosis and Electron Tomography based 3D reconstructions of Mitochondria-Phagosome interactions. The
research has the potential to reveal design principles that are of salience to other specialized phagocytic processes
such as clearance of apoptotic cells, toxic debris, and synaptic pruning. From a translational/preclinical perspective,
our findings may reveal novel molecular targets and pathways for new immunomodulatory therapies."

The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and its observational follow up Epidemiology of Diabetes
Intervention and Complications (EDIC) represent landmark achievements in diabetes research. The DCCT
enrolled 1441 men and women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in a randomized trial of intensive vs. conventional
insulin therapy, delaying the onset and progression of diabetic complications and dramatically changing the
management of patients worldwide. Implementation of tight glycemic control has reduced the frequency of
devastating complications of T1D such as early death, blindness and amputation. Women and men with T1D
face new challenges including cognitive decline, autonomic dysfunction and urological disorders. UroEDIC, an
ancillary study examining urological complications in the DCCT/EDIC cohort, combines over 25 years
of detailed medical information and >90% participation in urological symptom assessment annually
since 2010, making it the longest running most extensive urological evaluation of persons with T1D.
The previous funding cycle identified lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and urinary incontinence (UI) as
urological disorders in men and women with T1D with the highest prevalence and greatest impact on quality of
life (QOL). By linking powerful longitudinal urological phenotypes with extensive clinical and laboratory data of
the DCCT/EDIC, we can substantially deepen our understanding of diabetes associated urinary complications.
Preliminary analyses show that although many patients develop a fixed state of LUTS or UI, many others move
in and out of the state over time. Our overall hypothesis is that metabolic, autonomic and epithelial
dysfunctions are associated with persistent and reversible subphenotypes of LUTS and UI in men and women
with diabetes. Observations also indicate bladder overactivity in both genders is increasing in this cohort.
However, there is a lack of understanding of the burden and impact of other diabetic bladder problems,
particularly diabetic cystopathy, classically described as decreased bladder sensation, poor contractility and
high residual urine volume. The goals of UroEDIC Bladder, therefore, are to 1) characterize the full spectrum
of bladder dysfunction in T1D, 2) create risk models that explain the progression and remission of LUTS/UI,
and 3) identify mechanistic themes underpinning the persistence of these symptoms. The specific aims of
this project are designed to incorporate newly proposed and available longitudinal data on bladder
retention, autonomic dysfunction and novel transcriptional signatures with the full range of
DCCT/EDIC measurements to gain deeper insight into the longitudinal patterns and mechanisms of
LUTS/UI and comprehensively characterize diabetic bladder dysfunction in T1D."
10813860,"ABSTRACT: Frequency-following responses (FFRs) are scalp-recorded electrophysiological
‘neurophonic’ potentials that reflect phase-locked activity from neural ensembles across the
auditory pathway. FFRs provide a neural snapshot of the integrity of supra-threshold speech
processing that can be measured non-invasively using a minimal electrophysiological set-up that
already exists in audiology clinics, has high test-retest reliability, and requires minimal subject
preparation. The original project, titled “Online modulation of auditory brainstem responses to
speech”, examined the extent to which FFRs, which were thought to primarily reflect subcortical
auditory processing, were influenced by experience-dependent plasticity. The previous proposal
systematically tested a predictive tuning model that proposed that subcortical auditory processing
is not hard-wired in adults, and that there is continuous fine-tuning of the representation of
stimulus features guided by top-down expectations. An evolving perspective is that the FFR
should be considered an integrated response from both subcortical and cortical neural
ensembles. There is a critical need to understand cortical contributions to the FFR to realize the
fundamental translational potential as a biomarker for many clinical conditions. In this renewal
application, the primary focus is to understand the properties of the cortical source of the FFR at
a mechanistic level, as well as the larger role of cortico-collicular modulatory influences on the
FFR. Using a highly complementary and cross-disciplinary team of PIs, this proposal builds on
key scientific insights gained in the first funding period with the explicit goal of accelerating pre-
clinical to clinical translation. Using a cross-species (human, macaque, guinea pigs), cross-level
(cells to meso-scale), neurocomputational approach, this proposal systematically deconstructs
the role of the cortex in the generation and modulation of the FFR. Aim 1 will measure scalp-
recorded FFRs and intracranial cortical activity in human patients, macaques, and guinea pigs to
characterize cortical phase-locking limits, laminar and frequency dependence, and hemispheric
asymmetry. Aim 2 will measure scalp-recorded and intracranial FFRs to human and non-human
vocalizations using a harmonized protocol in all three species. Using representational similarity
analyses to quantify cross-species and cross-level similarities, Aim 2 will examine the influence
of predictability, category relevance, and subject arousal on the FFRs. Aim 3 leverages this
information to build a novel computational model that consists of a core feedforward module
that is modulated by a feedback cortico-collicular module. Predictions from this model will be
systematically validated in human patients with Heschl’s gyrus lesions, and using chemogenetic
experiments to reversibly suppress cortico-collicular feedback in animal models."
10834012,"Project Summary
Identifying the cellular pathways that promote disease or which prospective therapies are effective relies upon
appropriate mammalian models. Therefore, there is an urgent need for advanced human model systems that
can accurately reproduce human anatomy and physiology to help predict human disease progression and as-
sess potential treatment options. The long-term goal is to utilize a novel in vitro lung-on-a-chip (LOAC) microflu-
idic device to predict how xenobiotics lead to inflammatory, fibrotic and immunomodulatory pulmonary diseases
in humans. The overall objective is to create the first fully organic LOAC that is structurally supported by a cell-
derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and includes innate immune cells to simulate organ-level functionality. The
rationale for the proposed research is to employ the unique properties of porous silicon (PSi) not previously
explored to revolutionize the field of material science in the fabrication of microfluidic platforms that incorporates
dynamic ECM changes. Guided by strong preliminary data, the overall objective will be accomplished by pursing
the following three specific aims: 1) Identify the optimal parameters and cellular mechanisms to dissolve ultrathin
porous silicon during long-term culture; 2) Determine the extent to which co-cultured cells within the LOAC se-
crete and create their own ECM; and 3) Develop a multicellular alveolar structure to activate immune cells leading
to extravasation and ECM remodeling using an in vitro model of pulmonary hypertension. Under the first aim,
the working hypothesis based on preliminary data is that human macrophages (MACs) are essential to modify
and dissolve PSi. Dissolution rates of PSi will be quantified through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
surface analysis will be completed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to reproducibly create flexible, structurally
intact membranes. Under the second aim, the working hypothesis is that endothelial cells (ECs) will express and
secrete cell-derived ECM proteins. Secretion of de novo synthesized ECM components will be quantified through
RT-PCR, confocal immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy and AFM. The third aim based on preliminary data in-
dicate epithelial cells (EPCs), ECs and MACs can be successfully co-cultured and are viable during long-term
culture on PSi membranes. The working hypothesis is in the presence of hypoxic conditions, MACs will become
activated and release soluble mediators leading to apoptosis of ECs and increased ECM remodeling that will be
quantified through confocal IF microscopy and live cell imaging. The proposed research is innovative, in our
opinion, because it represents a substantive departure from the status quo by utilizing the unique characteristics
of PSi, which is a biocompatible and biodegradable material. In addition, utilizing PSi provides the capability to
create a cell specific ECM that will release biochemical cues including growth factors and extracellular protein-
ases. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to have broad translational importance in the
prevention and treatment of a wide range of pulmonary diseases. Finally, therapeutic advancements in the de-
velopment of PSi nanomaterials and factors that lead to degradation in vivo are expected."
10820441,"ABSTRACT:
Background: EGF receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is overexpressed in
over 50% of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where it is linked to metastasis and poor prognosis.
Cetuximab, an EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibody is approved by US-FDA to treat advanced
wild-type KRAS CRC. However, cetuximab, as monotherapy, is effective in only about 10% of
CRCs and resistance frequently emerges. Thus, there is a pressing need 1) to identify those
patients most likely to respond (or not respond) to cetuximab and 2) to devise treatment strategies
that would prevent resistance and/or enhance cetuximab response. We propose to address these
needs by aggressively pursuing our observations that enhanced activity of multiple RTKs (e.g.
MET and RON) confers de novo and acquired cetuximab resistance, which may be overcome by
addition of the dual MET/RON inhibitor, crizotinib. Our central hypothesis is that upregulation of
RTK activity confers cetuximab resistance in CRC and that it may be a viable therapeutic target.
In Aim 1 we will identify the mechanism of RTK cooperation during CRC progression and
cetuximab resistance using genetic and chemical modifications in CRC cell lines and patient-
derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids (PDOs). In Aim 2 we will assess the impact of disrupting
RTK cooperation in overcoming resistance to EGFR-directed antibodies. In Aim 3 we will identify
rational drug combinations and stratify patient populations to overcome resistance to EGFR-
directed mAbs.
Study design: We will employ our in vitro 3D culture system for CRC cell lines and PDOs and in
vivo nude mice xenografts, PDXs, and immune-competent syngeneic mouse CRC models in this
grant. We will also employ complementary approaches (Transwell cultures, tumor tissue
microarrays, phospho-RTK arrays, and human CRC samples) in relevant sections. Key proteins
(EGFR, MET, RON, ERBB3, HGF, HGFL, NRG1 and other positive and negative RTK and ligand
regulators) will be manipulated (overexpression, CRISPR-mediated knockout, ligand stimulation,
and chemical and antibody-based inhibition) to characterize individual contribution. These
experiments will be recorded at subcellular localization, morphological, and phenotypic levels to
tease out key differences.
These studies will identify and characterize new modes of cetuximab resistance and its
prevalence in CRC, while devising means to prevent or overcoming the resistance. This research
will help optimize precision medicine and stratify individuals based on their response/resistance
profile for better CRC treatment and management."
10831429,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 It is being increasingly recognized that changes in chromatin state are associated with a wide spectrum of
lung diseases, ranging from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). However, the mechanisms by which these changes contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases,
and how to manipulate the epigenome for therapeutic benefit, remains largely unknown. Modulation of chromatin
accessibility is an important epigenetic mechanism by which gene expression is controlled, even across repeated
cell divisions. However, as a prerequisite to understanding how altered chromatin accessibility contributes to
disease, the mechanisms by which chromatin accessibility patterns first establish and maintain cellular identity
within the lung must be defined.
 This proposal is based on studies from our group that identified the SWI/SNF proteins Arid1a and Arid1b
as key mediators of the chromatin accessibility changes that occur during development of the SOX9+ lung
epithelial stem/progenitor cell population. Our data demonstrate that loss of Arid1a or Arid1b led to persistence of
the SOX9+ progenitor cell population, impaired alveolar differentiation, and neonatal death due to respiratory
distress. In addition, ARID1A directly interacts with NKX2-1 and SOX9. The central hypothesis of the present
proposal is that ARID1A and ARID1B interact with key lung developmental TFs to direct the SWI/SNF complex to
remodel chromatin at specific loci, silencing progenitor cell gene expression programs and promoting the
maturation and function of the mature alveolar epithelium. The proposed studies will: A) Define the role that
Arid1a/Arid1b, and the larger SWI/SNF complex, play in establishment of mature alveolar cell type identify in
mouse and human. B) Identify the mechanism(s) by which the SWI/SNF complex remodels chromatin, in
conjunction with key lung transcription factors, to establish and maintain gene expression modules controlling
type I & II AEC identity and function. C) Determine how Arid1a/Arid1b-mediated chromatin remodeling contributes
to the lung epithelial repair response following influenza infection.
 These studies will provide conceptual advances in our understanding of how mature alveolar epithelial
cells are established and maintained, how the chromatin accessibility landscape interacts with previously well-
defined transcription factor networks, and how chromatin remodeling directs the normal repair process after lung
injury. Emerging epigenomic tools and systems biology approaches will be applied to the epithelium for the first
time. Taken together, these data will inform future translational studies seeking to understand how alterations in
the epigenome contribute to lung disease, and will provide a foundation for future efforts to manipulate the lung’s
epigenomic code to restore normal lung structure and function."

Project Summary/Abstract
The overall mission of the Delaware Nemours DuPont Hospital for Children IDeA States Pediatric Clinical
Trials Network site (DE-Nemours/AIDHC ISPCTN site) is to facilitate implementation of well-designed
pediatric clinical trials, recruit underserved/rural children to participate in these clinical trials, and enhance
pediatric clinical trial capacity within the IDeA state, DE. DE has notably high rates of infant prematurity and
mortality, asthma, obesity, and infants born with neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome. The opportunity and the
potential impact of pediatric clinical advances are significant in DE, whose population (~1 million) serves as a
microcosm of the US, demographically, in urban-to-rural citizen ratio and ethnic/racial diversity. It has one
major children’s hospital (AIDHC with >90% of DE pediatric admissions), one major obstetric hospital
(Christiana Hospital with >80% of DE deliveries, ~7000/year), and a statewide integrated pediatric primary care
network (19 community practices). In this renewal application, we demonstrate our progress in creating and
sustaining collaborative clinical trials that address strategic health issues and overcome barriers to inclusion of
children residing in rural or impoverished areas of DE. The DE ISPCTN site will continue to harness key
resources including 1) 19 DE pediatrics and primary care practice-based networks that cover over 65,000
children (23% in rural areas, 19% in poverty and 52% Medicaid), 2) access to historically underrepresented
pediatric populations in DE, including rural, African-American and Hispanic/Latino populations, and 3) robust
community engagement programs such as the Nemours children's health website KidsHealth, the most-
visited pediatric health site (1 million hits/day). We have the human talent, with highly experienced clinical
research teams (PI, Co-Is, junior and senior investigators, coordinators, data entry staff) and the clinical
research infrastructure (Clinical research center, IRB processes, standard operating procedures). Nemours/
AIDHC has >15 years’ experience with system-wide use of electronic medical records (EPIC) in clinical trials
research. These factors allow for highly effective recruitment and retention in current ISPCTN clinical trials and
reach rural and underserved children in the state. The DE site will continue to synergize with robust DE IDeA
state resources. Further, we delineate how our strengths in community engagement/patient recruitment,
clinician and researcher engagement, and clinical research infrastructure capacity building have allowed us to
engage in clinical trials in the focus areas in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO)
Program including Upper/lower airway disorders, Obesity, Pre-/peri-/postnatal outcomes, and Neurodevelop-
ment. The DE site will continue to work closely with the ISPCTN Data Coordinating and Operations Center in
development and implementation of clinical trials, will collaborate with the overall ECHO program and the NIH,
and will expand capacity to engage rural/underserved populations in DE. Provision of this expertise and infra-
structure will increase cutting edge clinical trial research aimed at improving public health in DE and the US.

10864023,"While antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced HIV disease morbidity and mortality, it has failed to
eliminate viral reservoirs. Interruption of treatment leads to activation of latent virus and rebound viremia within
weeks. Novel strategies are urgently needed to eradicate latent infections and enhance the immune system

""CRISPR for Cure."" The overarching goal of this program is to use genome editing mediated by CRISPR to
enhance immune responses and directly ablate HIV proviruses. We have assembled a collaborative team of
highly accomplished basic and translational scientists working in tandem with community stakeholders and a
small biotechnology company to develop CRISPR-based therapies to directly target the HIV provirus and to
enhance immunological responses. The research program is comprised of three highly interactive research
foci (RF) that will utilize interdisciplinary, innovative and collaborative research approaches with community
and government input. RF1 will use next generation sequencing and novel barcoded viruses to define the HIV
reservoir and the impact of epigenetic mechanisms on proviral rebound. In RF2, we will enhance effector NK
and CTL cell function and killing and limit viral spread by target cells using innovative genome editing
strategies. RF3 will create and test the next generation of inducible, multiplex CRISPR with increased
specificity, potency and safety for delivery by CD4 tropic lymphoid AAV9 for eradication of HIV-1 proviral DNA
in animal models whose immune cells are modified in RF2 and assess the possibility of both a universal and
personalized CRISPR in eliminating replication competent virus in vivo. In addition to the shared focus on
CRISPRs technology, the Collaboratory will undertake a highly integrated experimental agenda through the
shared use of barcoded viruses in humanized mice and unique
support
MISTRG humanized mice that differentially
human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell maintenance and myelopoiesis;rhesus macaques
infected with a novel SIV barcoded virus; ex vivo clinical samples from a well characterized cohort and the use
of adenoviruses to efficiently deliver CRISPRs to an in vivo humanized animal model carrying cells from
patient-derived PBMCs. The outcome of this comprehensive and multidisciplinary program by the “CRISPR for

10840411,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 IL-17 family cytokines promote inflammation that drives the development of colorectal neoplasia, which
eventually lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus far, the underlying mechanism has largely been attributed to
IL-17’s role in myeloid cell recruitment. Whether IL-17 also signals to adaptive immune cells, in particular CD4+
regulatory T cells (Tregs), and whether this signaling plays a role in colorectal tumorigenesis, remains unknown.
Our preliminary studies show that targeted ablation of IL-17 signaling on Treg cells increased colonic tumor
development in mice, demonstrating a previously unknown protective role of IL-17 in CRC. We also found that
IL-17 directly inhibits Treg accumulation in tumors. Further, IL-17 inhibits the expression of genes that facilitate
Treg migration, proliferation, and immune suppressive function. Importantly, these effects are only observed in
tumor-infiltrating Tregs, suggesting a site-specific inhibition of Tregs by IL-17. Consistent with this notion, only
tumor-infiltrating Tregs express IL-17RC and RE – co-receptors for IL-17A, C, and F cytokines. Stimulation of
Tregs with IL-6 and IL-1β, two cytokines that are abundant in the tumor environment, upregulates IL-17RE,
suggesting that the tumor microenvironment renders Tregs susceptible to IL-17-mediated inhibition. On the other
hand, we also found that IL-17 signals to tumor cells to downregulate the expression of CXCL9 and 10, which
signal through their cognate receptor CXCR3 to attract CD8+ CTLs to the tumor. These preliminary findings
support our hypothesis that IL-17 regulates colorectal tumor development through two opposing mechanisms:
1) IL-17 directly inhibits Tregs that would otherwise suppress cancer immunosurveillance; and 2) IL-17 inhibits
the attraction of CD8+ CTLs into the tumor environment by downregulating CXCL9/10 production. Given the
critical roles of both Tregs and Th17 cells in tumor development, along with the knowledge gap relating to the
impact of IL-17 on Treg biology, we propose the following studies: 1) Delineate how IL-17 mediates direct
inhibition of Tregs in colorectal tumors; 2) Elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying IL-17-mediated
inhibition of Tregs; and 3) Interrogate how IL-17 inhibits T cell attraction through the regulation of CXCL9/10, and
test the importance of IL-17-Treg circuitry in colorectal tumor development and therapy. These investigations will
provide new insights into the mechanisms by which IL-17 impacts colorectal tumorigenesis, as well as guide the
invention and use of novel therapies for the treatment of CRC in humans. For example, based on a role for IL-
17 in inhibiting CD8+ CTL attraction to tumor, we may employ currently available IL-17A and IL-17RA antibodies
as adjuvant agents for cancer immunotherapy. However, for tumors that are abundant with IL-17 and Tregs,
neutralizing IL-17 may further enhance Treg’s immune suppression and worsen treatment outcome. Uncoupling
IL-17-Treg interactions may also be important for the treatment of autoimmunity and bacterial infections, and will
be explored in subsequent studies."
10846591,"Pathogenic bacteria survive in complex and hostile environments in the host. Several host- and
microbiota-derived factors curb pathogen growth during infection. Successful pathogens respond by
exploiting the cues in their immediate environment to coordinate spatiotemporal production of virulence
factors. Our preliminary data indicate that the human pathogen group A streptococcus (GAS) is
engaged in arms race with a commensal bacterium during oropharyngeal infection. The commensal
bacteria produce a previously unknown antimicrobial metabolite with a novel chemical scaffold that may
contribute to host defense against GAS colonization in human oropharynx. As a countermeasure, GAS
employs secreted cysteine protease SpeB, a major virulence factor, to overcome commensal defenses
by proteolytically degrading the antimicrobial metabolites. Despite our experimental evidence
suggesting antagonism between GAS and commensal bacterium, the factors and mechanisms that
regulate antimicrobial metabolite production in the commensal and their influence on SpeB production
by GAS are unknown. Recently, we discovered a novel GAS quorum sensing pathway comprised of a
new class of bacterial quorum sensing signal, a leaderless secreted peptide, and an intracellular
receptor that controls the temporal expression of speB during infection. Interestingly, the commensal
bacterium also employs a leaderless peptide-dependent quorum sensing pathway to control the
antimicrobial metabolite production. However, our preliminary data suggest that GAS hijacks the
commensal peptide signal to induce its endogenous quorum sensing pathway and activate SpeB
production. This finding is highly relevant to GAS pathogenesis as the interspecies signaling facilitates
virulence factor production in a suboptimal host environment and promotes GAS virulence. Using a
multidisciplinary approach combining microbiological, genetic, biochemical and imaging
methodologies, and animal infection studies, we will dissect the molecular details of intra- and inter-
species signaling, characterize the mechanism of antagonism between the two bacterial species,
determine its impact on GAS pathogenesis, and elucidate the mechanism of intercellular signaling by
leaderless peptides in four specific aims. The results from this study will elucidate how the peptide
signaling pathways are tailored for the physiological needs of the producing bacteria and how a
pathogen gain survival advantage by hijacking the non-cognate signal from a commensal microbe to
trigger virulence factor production and cause disease. The proposed research is significant as it
investigates a critical process in disease pathogenesis of a major human pathogen and is likely to
elucidate novel translational strategies to combat GAS infections."
10901983,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) exhibit marked inter-individual heterogeneity in frequency
of acute pain events, or vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) and development of chronic pain. The nidus
of a VOC is typically the adhesion of a leukocyte to the endothelium, bringing with it a red cell
which deoxygenates and sickles, resulting in vaso-occlusion, ischemia, and pain. We therefore
collected SCD patient RNA from CD71+ cells (red cell precursors that still retain RNA) and
CD45+, leukocytes from individuals with and without chronic pain, and longitudinal collections
obtained at steady state, in VOC, and VOC resolution, and submitted these samples to TOPMed
for RNASeq analysis. We propose to leverage this transcriptome data from a well phenotyped
pediatric SCD cohort to address the unmet need of objective, quantifiable markers of acute and
chronic pain, and evaluate in the context of the germline and somatic mutations found in the same
subjects’ whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, also in TOPMed. Short term goals are to 1)
identify genes and pathways altered in the chronic pain state, 2) identify transcriptome changes
associated with pain events and their resolution, 3) generate a transcriptional risk score for the
development of chronic pain, and 4) determine which variants associated with chronic pain
development are likely to be causative through transcriptome wide association studies. Long
term goals are to use these findings to 1) develop targeted therapies to prevent and treat VOC,
2) therapies to treat chronic pain in SCD, and 3) biomarkers to distinguish acute pain events from
chronic pain. The ability to do so will allow providers to manage VOC appropriately and
aggressively, without inadvertently confusing chronic pain with an acute pain episode. Our
inability to distinguish between acute and chronic pain harms our patients, as the opioids that are
the mainstay for VOC treatment often worsen chronic pain through opioid induced hyperalgesia.
Our work will leverage TOPMed samples via our innovative transcriptomics analysis to identify
risk factors, therapeutic targets, and biomarkers of chronic pain, in order to improve the care and
quality of life of individuals living with SCD."
10833530,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major and increasing health problem in the US (especially in Kentucky) and
worldwide. In spite of the magnitude of this problem, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD. In
addition, the mechanisms and regulators of the disease progression and severity are not well understood. Dietary
fats play an important interactive role with alcohol consumption in ALD pathogenesis, however, the role of n3
PUFAs in ALD are not well defined. Our central hypothesis is that n3 PUFAs are beneficial in ALD, in part, via
n3-PUFA-derived pro-resolving mediators which facilitate inflammation resolution, improvement in the gut-liver
axis, and subsequent attenuation of liver injury. We propose that resolvin D1 (RvD1) is a potent therapeutic
agent in severe ALD acting via RvD1-FPR2-NEAT1 signaling to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and to
promote repair of hepatocellular damage, in part, via enhancement of pro-restorative macrophages. We
postulate that compromised inflammation resolution due to impaired RvD1 production/signaling is one of the
critical nutritional contributing factors to the progressive ALD and severity of alcoholic hepatitis (AH) in humans.
The Specific Aims of the proposal are: Aim 1. To test whether n3 PUFAs exert beneficial effects on EtOH-
associated liver injury/inflammation by enhancing the effectiveness of inflammation resolution and by
repair of hepatocellular damage through increase in n3-PUFA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators
promoting
(SPMs), and RvD1-FPR2 and Neat1-mediated suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and
reprogramming pro-inflammatory macrophages into a pro-restorative phenotype. Wild Type (WT), Fpr2-/-,
Neat1-/-, and transgenic fat-1 mice (which are able to endogenously convert n6 to n3 PUFAs) will be used in this
Aim. We will also examine the therapeutic effectiveness of RvD1 utilizing a novel nanoparticle technology of
targeted RvD1 delivery examine the role n3-PUFAs
to the liver with plant-derived edible exosomes. Aim 2. To
and RvD1 in maintaining gut barrier integrity, and in the resolution of intestinal inflammation in experimental ALD.
We will: i) test in vivo, in animal models, and in vitro, in intestinal organoid culture, whether n3 PUFA or RvD1
improve intestinal barrier damage by attenuating intestinal immune dysregulation; ii) test in vivo whether
disruption of the RvD1-FPR2 axis exacerbates, while blocking Neat1 signaling attenuates intestinal inflammation
and alterations in the gut barrier integrity; iii) test a novel therapeutic strategy of administering an engineered
bacteria strain to convert n6 to n3 PUFAs in the intestine and thus to attenuate gut barrier dysfunction in mice.
In Aim 3, we seek to translate and extend our findings in animal models to human ALD. Utilizing de-identified
human samples we will: i) determine effects of n3-PUFA dietary supplementation on plasma SPM levels, markers
of liver injury, systemic inflammation, and intestinal permeability in heavy drinking individuals; ii) examine plasma
SPM levels, and SPM synthesis in whole blood and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) obtained from AH
patients; and iii) test whether RvD1 improves phagocytosis/efferocytosis of PBMCs obtained from AH patients."
10833537,"This project (Project 2) will define specific pathogenic features of alcohol-induced gut dysbiosis and investigate
its causative role (and underlying mechanisms) in systemic/hepatic immune dysregulation in alcoholic liver

that loss of butyrate producing bacteria is a significant pathogenic feature of gut dysbiosis in patients with ALD,
which plays a major role in developing a pro-inflammatory T cell-IL-17 milieu leading to pathogenic changes in
the gut-liver axis in ALD. This project will utilize a highly innovative animal model of human fecal microbiota
transplant (FMT) from alcoholic hepatitis patients into conventional mice that recapitulates key features of
human ALD, to identify mechanisms and develop targeted therapeutic interventions. Specifically, the project
will test the efficacy of evidence-based nutritional therapeutic strategies that target gut dysbiosis, namely, (i)
Tributyrin (Tb), a dietary butyrate pro-drug and known HDAC inhibitor and (ii) Faecalibacterium prausnitzi - a
major human butyrate producing probiotic. The proposal leverages existing resources of the NIH funded
AlcHepNet clinical consortium (U01AA026980) which include a large available cohort of ALD patients and
control subjects, participant recruitment, validated demographic and clinical data, biospecimen and biomarker
collection and clinical expertise in liver diseases. This proposed study will provide new insights into the
mechanisms underlying ALD and identify new targets for ALD treatment, thereby contributing to the ULARC

10833540,"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is among the most devastating consequences of the widespread use
and abuse of alcohol. Growing evidence suggests that impairment of the differentiation, migration, and survival
of neural crest cells (NCCs) is a major component of the pathogenesis of FASD. However, there is a fundamental
gap in understanding how ethanol leads to the dysregulation of gene expression and subsequently impairs NCC
development in embryos. Enhancers are DNA elements that govern spatial and temporal regulation of gene
expression through its function as integrated transcriptional factor binding platforms. We have recently
demonstrated that ethanol exposure resulted in a locus-specific reduction in enhancer activity across the genome
in zebrafish embryos, as indicated by lower levels of H3K27ac mark in ethanol-exposed embryos relative to
control. We termed these sites as the Ethanol-induced Variant Enhancer Loci (E-VELs). In addition, ethanol
treatment reduced the activity of the selected enhancers in human NCCs (hNCCs). The objective of this proposal
is to elucidate the mechanisms by which enhancers mediate ethanol-induced impairment of NCC development
and teratogenesis and to establish epigenetic modulation of enhancer activity as a feasible approach for
preventing FASD. The central hypothesis of this project is that ethanol epigenetically modulates the activity of
the selected enhancers and subsequently disrupts the expression of their cognate genes in NCCs, leading to
the impairment of the differentiation, migration, and survival of NCCs and teratogenesis and that epigenetic
modulation of the activity of the selected enhancers and the expression of their cognate genes by sulforaphane
(SFN) or broccoli-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (BELNs) can prevent ethanol-induced teratogenesis. To
test our hypothesis, the following specific aims will be addressed: Aim 1: To identify the E-VELs that are
associated with aberrant expression of their cognate genes involved in NCC and craniofacial development in
hNCCs and zebrafish embryos. Aim 2: To functionally validate the role of the selected E-VELs in ethanol-induced
dysregulation of gene expression, impairment of the differentiation, migration and survival of NCCs and ethanol-
induced teratogenesis. Aim 3: To elucidate the mechanisms by which ethanol epigenetically modulates the
activity of the selected E-VELs that modulate the expression of genes involved in the differentiation, migration,
and survival of NCCs. Aim 4: To test the hypothesis that epigenetic modulation of the activity of the selected E-
VELs by SFN or BELNs represents a novel therapeutic strategy for preventing ethanol-induced teratogenesis.
The proposed work is innovative, because this is the first study attempting to prevent FASD through the newly
recognized role of enhancers in regulating gene expression and NCC development. It also represents the first
attempt to prevent FASD using edible plant-derived exosome-like nanoparticles. This study is also significant,
because the results from this study are expected to provide insights into the mechanisms by which enhancers
mediate ethanol-induced teratogenesis and to yield enhancer-based strategies for the prevention of FASD."
10833544,"Probiotics have been used to prevent/treat alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Live probiotics need to colonize the gut
to exert their function. Unfortunately, underlying disease states provide an unfavorable environment for probiotic
bacterial gut colonization, which diminishes probiotics’ function. In the last few years, we showed that LGG
culture supernatant (LGGs, without live bacteria) was effective in the prevention of ALD in experimental models
of acute and chronic alcohol exposure in mice. However, how LGG supernatant exerts its therapeutic effects is
not fully understood. Exosomes are nanoparticles (NPs) derived from cell endocytosis which act as transmitters
between cells. Recent studies show that bacteria, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive, produce NPs. The
NPs derived from “bad” bacteria have been demonstrated to be pathogenic. However, “good” bacteria-,
probiotics-derived NPs have not been studied. Our preliminary study showed that administration of LGG-derived
exosome-like NPs (LDNPs) effectively reversed ALD in the binge-on-chronic alcohol exposure mouse model,
suggesting that probiotic LGGs may exert its function through LDNPs in ALD. Administration of LDNPs markedly
increased intestinal AhR activity, IL-22, and regenerating islet-derived 3 (Reg3) β and γ expression, which play
a key role in maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis and preventing bacterial intestinal transcytosis. In addition,
LDNPs administration significantly increased intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) tight junctions and decreased
circulating LPS concentration associated with upregulation of intestinal Nrf2 signaling, which is known for
protecting intestinal barrier junctions against oxidative stress-induced damage by alcohol. Metabolomic analysis
revealed that LDNPs contain high levels of microbial metabolites of tryptophan, which are AhR ligands, indicating
LDNPs may activate intestinal AhR signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ginger exosome-like
nanoparticles (GDNPs) are preferentially taken up by LGG, suggesting that GDNP may serve as a prebiotic to
enhance the effects of LGG. These preliminary studies provide the groundwork for our central hypothesis that,
by activating intestinal AhR-Nrf2 signaling, LDNPs increase intestinal expression of Il-22, Reg3 and tight
junctions, and modulate gut microbiota homeostasis and enhance intestinal barrier function, leading to the
suppression of ALD. We will test our hypothesis in following four specific aims: (1) Determine the role of bacteria-
derived NPs in ALD; (2) Define the mechanisms of the beneficial effects of LDNPs in ALD; (3) Determine whether
GDNPs treatment enhances LDNP production and AhR agonist enrichment that lead to improved effects of
LDNPs against ALD; and (4) Evaluate the intestinal AhR-Nrf2 signaling in alcoholic hepatitis patients treated with
LGG. Completion of this study is expected to significantly impact the development of LGG-based probiotic
therapeutics in the treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases."

academic support to build a pool of potential U-RISE Scholars with training in research,
non-cognitive skills and career development for U-RISE Scholars.
Our rationale is that upon completion of the proposed training, students will have
acquired the technical and career-building skills required to complete a Ph.D. in the
biomedical sciences or pursue careers in biomedical research.
Our Specific Aims are to:
 1) Provide course support and research exposure to introductory science students
 to build a large pool of potential U-RISE students and support all students to
 succeed in their degree completion.
 2) Select 4 U-RISE scholars per year (steady state of 8 students in a cohort) and
 provide them with outstanding research experiences and a support network to
 ensure that 100% graduate with a BA or BS in Biology or Chemistry, pursue an
 advanced degree in biomedical research, and succeed in their post-graduate
education.
We will also imbed a culture of mentoring, ethics and data reproducibility, and evaluate
program elements under the guidance of a professional evaluator."
10815797,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposed postdoctoral training program (2 fellows/year, 2-year program) in endocrinology and
metabolism will provide comprehensive research training for individuals with a serious commitment to a
career at the interface of biomedical research and endocrine disorders. Metabolic diseases represent
significant health burden in the US; advances in the pathophysiology of these diseases are required to
improve diagnostics, therapeutics and health outcomes. Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) is experiencing
accelerating growth in clinical and biomedical research activities, due to the singular emphasis on
developing medical research over the past decade during the Deanships of Dr. Laurie Glimcher and Dr.
Augustine Choi. Investment in the Department of Medicine and the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes
and Metabolism has been significant. Dr. Anthony Hollenberg, a prominent endocrinologist and thyroid
biologist, was recruited to Chair the Department of Medicine in 2018; his support has catapulted metabolic
research to a high priority on campus, resulting in recruitments and significant internal and external
resources. Dr. Laura Alonso, islet biologist and PD on this proposal, was recruited in 2019 to be Chief of
the Endocrinology Division and Director of the Weill Center for Metabolic Health, a newly assembled
research group on campus focused on metabolism, with 45+ faculty and 150+ members. Our proposed
T32 leadership team also includes Dr. Julianne Imperato-McGinley, renowned endocrinologist, prior
Division Chief and current Director of the Weill Cornell CTSC. However, the impetus for this proposal is
not the leadership team, but rather the incredible trainees that have been finding a path to academic
medicine even without T32 support. Three clinical endocrine fellows in the past 10 years managed to
obtain K08 awards and are currently leading successful academic research careers, despite the lack of
an available T32; one of our current 2nd year fellows elected to pursue a 3rd year of research training even
though our program has been advertised as a 2-year clinical program, and both of the incoming clinical
fellows for 2022 are outstanding researchers, one with a PhD from Cal Tech and the other with a first
author Nature Medicine paper in islet biology, mentored by one of our faculty preceptors (Dr. Lo). We
have hand-picked a top team of research Preceptors, and designed a comprehensive didactic training
plan with wrap-around mentoring to guide trainees through eventual R01 submission. Our recruitment
plan is thorough and has a strong emphasis towards enrolling top URM candidates. We propose a tri-
institutional (WCM, MSKCC and RU), rigorous multidisciplinary T32 to enroll 2 postdoctoral MD or PhD
trainees annually for 2 years training duration each. The leaders of this training program will work with
the utmost enthusiasm and energy to ensure that our trainees reach their potential to excel and contribute
significantly to the academic endocrine community for years to come."

Mental illness affects 15% of the population and creates enormous morbidity and cost. Physician-scientists
have a critical role to play in advancing our understanding of its underlying pathophysiology and developing,
refining, and deploying novel strategies for diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and cure. Yet the number of
physician-scientists entering psychiatry remains distressingly limited – precisely when the science is advancing
at an accelerating rate and new, science-grounded therapeutics are beginning to appear.
This R25-funded training program, the Integrated Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Training (IMPORT)
Program, has been training physician-scientist in the Yale psychiatry residency for 15 years. Its innovative
design creates continuous, accelerated protected time for research, beginning in the first year of residency
training and continuing through graduation. IMPORT trainees have gone on to faculty positions at top
institutions, including leadership positions at major institutions. In this renewal application we build on this
success, continuing the core training structure that has worked so well. We augment the training program in
several important ways. First, we have enhanced our support for trainees from underrepresented
backgrounds, recognizing that advancing the field requires not only recruitment of trainees with a diversity of
backgrounds and perspectives, but also retention of these trainees through a network of supports. We have
had considerable success in both recruitment and retention; we here apply the lessons learned from this
experience. Second, we provide new training in scientific communication, so that our trainees will be
positioned not only to create the innovations that will drive the field forward, but also to disseminate them to
clinical providers and to the broader public. Third, we newly focus on participant-engaged research, which is
increasingly recognized as critical both for the identification of the most impactful research questions and for
the acceptance of new findings by at-risk populations. Finally, we reinforce our supports for grant-writing and
career development, which are critical for the success of our trainees.
Through these enhancements, we take the successful IMPORT program and improve it for the next
generation. We are inspired by the success of this program over the past 15 years and energized to continue
our support of psychiatric physician-scientists as we move into the next phase of this important training grant."
10802444,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY:
Cannabis use (CU) initiated in adolescence is associated with substantial consequences, from cognitive
decline to addiction. While CU may disrupt normal processes of adolescent brain development, relatively little
is known about how adolescent CU disrupts circuits mediating cognitive flexibility (adaptation to changing
rewards and punishments) and intrinsic resting state functional connectivity (RSFC), and impacts reward
motivation (the amount of goal-directed behavior to earn reinforcement). These domains are all understudied
areas relative to adult CU yet advancing knowledge of these processes may explain why adolescent-onset CU
is linked to functional impairments and higher rates of problematic substance use. Dr. Thomas’s long-term
career goal is to become an independent researcher identifying bio-behavioral mechanisms of risks and effects
of adolescent drug use in order to improve identification methods for targeted prevention and treatment. The
central hypothesis to be tested in this 4-year patient-oriented mentored career award is that CU in the context
of adolescent brain development is linked to frontostriatal alterations and impaired cognitive flexibility, reward
motivation, and intrinsic RSFC that will vary as a function of CU exposure. The central methodology is to use
symptom, circuit, and behavioral data in 14-17 year old adolescents who are engaged in CU and also typically-
developing control adolescents (n=40 of each). The career development objectives of this NIDA K23
application are to gain hands-on mentorship in (a) phenomenology and assessment of adolescent CU, (b) the
use of fMRI to measure brain/behavior alterations underlying adolescent CU, and (c) advanced statistical
methods for greater level of inference from these data, by learning a computational psychiatry model. The
research objectives of this K23 are to: (1) to identify the brain/behavior mechanisms of cognitive flexibility and
RSFC associated with CU using fMRI; (2) to define behavioral alterations in reward motivation; (3) to use
advanced statistical methods, including a specific computational model, to integrate the neural and behavioral
contributions to decision-making during a cognitive flexibility task and determine how decision-making
components vary for CU adolescents and control adolescents. Brown University is a rich scientific environment
to conduct this research due to the expertise of mentors in adolescent substance use, neuroscience, and
advanced statistical methods with ample resources to carry out Dr. Thomas’s training plan consisting of hands-
on mentorship, workshops, coursework (e.g., neuroanatomy), and professional development (conference
presentations, publications). This project is significant because addressing the dearth of knowledge about
cognitive flexibility, reward motivation, and RSFC is the first step towards facilitating mechanism-based (a)
predictors of progression from regular CU to addiction, and (b) treatments for CU among adolescents. This
project is innovative in its use of fMRI to probe the relatively understudied domains of cognitive flexibility and
reward motivation among adolescents with and without CU using computational psychiatry analyses."
10807063,"Characterizing the Physiological and Pharmacological Roles of SLC22A24
Membrane transporters in the solute carrier superfamily (SLC) play critical roles in physiology and
pharmacology serving in the cellular uptake and removal of endogenous metabolites and many prescription
drugs. In spite of their importance, about one-fifth of SLC transporters have no known substrates and are
considered “orphan” proteins. Recently, our laboratory de-orphaned one of these proteins, SLC22A24, by
applying various methods, which included computational analyses of genomewide association signals,
homology modeling, expression profiling, and importantly, isotopic uptake assays in cells stably expressing
SLC22A24. Our studies revealed that SLC22A24 is an organic anion transporter with a preference for sulfate
and glucuronide conjugates of steroids. Recent preliminary studies suggest that the transporter also plays an
important role in drug disposition. The major goals of the proposed research are to determine the
physiological and pharmacological roles of SLC22A24 in the disposition of steroid glucuronides and to
discover other endogenous metabolites and pharmacologic agents that are substrates of SLC22A24.
To achieve our goals, we have designed three specific aims. In aim 1, we will employ studies in cell lines to
determine the localization of SLC22A24 to the basolateral or apical membranes. In addition, we will discover
prescription drugs and other metabolites that are substrates of SLC22A24. In aim 2, we will use CRISPR/Cas9
methods to create transgenic mice expressing SLC22A24 in the proximal tubule and use the mice to determine
its role in the disposition of pharmacologic and physiologic substrates of the transporter. Finally, in aim 3, we
will conduct association studies in healthy volunteers to associate functional variants in SLC22A24 with plasma
levels and renal clearance of steroid glucuronides. Methods employed will include confocal microscopy,
isotopic uptake and flux assays in cells, CRISPR/Cas9 methods in mice, LC/MS/ metabolomic analytical
methods, association analyses and clearance determinations in humans. We postulate that this
comprehensive genomic, metabolomic and functional studies in cells, mice and in healthy volunteers including
deep clinical phenotyping will serve as a blueprint for systematic evaluation of the physiological and
pharmacological roles of a newly de-orphaned transporter."

10839414,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder of aging that 
affects both motor and cognitive function. Despite more than fifty years of research, no cures 
exist and the standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Genome-­wide association studies 
(GWAS) have identified many regions harboring variants associated with PD. The next challenge 
in translational research is to identify the causal variants underlying the association signals, 
the affected genes, molecular pathways and their functional consequences. Because genetic 
variants can mediate effects on higher-­order phenotypes through effects on gene 
expression, the integration of transcriptomics into the study of disease associated variants has 
already proven to be a useful strategy, and indeed disease associated loci have been shown 
to be enriched for variants regulating gene expression. We have recently shown that genetic 
variants that affect gene expression in myeloid cells underlie a substantial fraction of the 
genetic associations to PD. We have also accumulated compelling data suggesting that many genes 
involved in autophagy-­lysosomal pathways and mitochondrial function are differentially 
expressed in monocytes and in microglia of PD cases compared to controls and in some cases, are 
genetically regulated by PD-­associated genetic variants. Here, in aim 1, we will generate bulk and 
single cell transcriptome and proteome profiles from 250 peripheral monocytes of early-­stage PD 
(with no medication, within 2 years from the onset of the symptoms), mid-­ to late-­stage 
PD, and age-­matched controls from a well-­characterized PD cohort. The sample collection 
and transcriptome profiles will be done longitudinally (at baseline and follow up within 2 
years). In aim 2, will characterize the transcriptome of primary microglia from 
multiple regions of autopsied brains of PD cases and age-­matched controls and explore the 
consequences on the transcriptome of PD susceptibility variants. We will conduct 
state-­of-­the-­art analyses that will integrate multi-­omic and clinical data sets to generate 
patient derived, data-­driven, multi-­scale models of disease, enabling the generation of 
hypotheses around protein interactions specific to disease states and subgroups. In aim 3, we will 
functionally characterize monocytes and microglia in order to investigate the effects that gene 
expression, protein abundance and network connectivity changes may have on immune functions of 
interest such as: 1) phagocytic capacity;; 2) lysosomal function;; and 3) mitochondrial activity. 
This project will have a large overall impact by: 1) providing key information bridging PD genetics 
to molecular mechanisms in monocytes and microglia, setting the stage for future mechanistic 
studies;; and (2) generating large-­scale, multi-­omic datasets, together with systems level 
analyses of these datasets in innate immune cells, which is an urgently needed resource."
10806197,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide Dr. Michael Li with invaluable research
experience, mentored training from interdisciplinary faculty, and training activities in a combination of behavioral
and basic sciences, which will prepare him well in his career as a biobehavioral researcher in addiction medicine
and HIV treatment/prevention. This K01 mechanism will support Dr. Li’s research and training efforts to develop
expertise in the following areas: (1) neurally regulated “stress” gene expression markers and links to addiction
and HIV disease progression; (2) cultural competence and ethical conduct; (3) technical assay and substantive
analytic methods in gene expression research; (4) clinical trial methods; and (5) professional development. Dr.
Li has assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team who will support key aspects of his training and research.
Dr. Steven Shoptaw is a highly productive and influential researcher in addiction medicine, and he has an
extensive track-record mentoring people who later became successful independent researchers. Co-mentor Dr.
Steven Cole has pioneered the field of social genomics, and will direct Dr. Li’s training in transcriptomic methods.
Dr. Jesse Clark will guide Dr. Li in clinical trial operations and safety procedures, and Dr. Thomas Belin will
provide extensive mentoring in advanced statistical methods and inferential frameworks in clinical trials. Dr. Li
proposes to investigate whether a neurally regulated “stress” gene expression pattern can serve as a clinically
meaningful, non-abstinence-based endpoint for contingency management for methamphetamine (METH) use
disorder (MUD) in MSM living with HIV. Abstinence determined by urine testing has been the only standard
clinical outcome for MUD treatment, but provides an incomplete picture of patient recovery. The gene expression
pattern called the conserved transcription response to adversity (CTRA) may provide insight into changes in both
psychosocial health and pathogenesis over the course of MUD treatment. The CTRA is marked by upregulated
expression of pro-inflammatory genes and downregulated expression of Type I interferon genes in response to
negative psychosocial experiences such as depression, anxiety, and violence, problems also comorbid with
METH use. The CTRA also involves some of same gene regulatory pathways that contribute to METH-related
pathogenesis, such as those involving inflammation and innate antiviral responses (relevant to PLWH). My
proposed research will use a two-arm clinical trial design (N=55) with 35 HIV-positive MSM with MUD receiving
contingency management for METH reduction, and 20 HIV-positive MSM who qualify as a non-substance-using
control to accomplish the following aims: 1) to investigate whether CTRA gene expression coincides with METH
use and viral load; 2) to investigate whether psychosocial indicators of addiction are associated with CTRA; and
3) to conduct an exploratory pilot investigation to determine the degree to which CTRA mediates the association
between METH use and viral load. Together, this K01 research project and training plan will play a fundamental
role in my early success as an independent substance use and HIV researcher."
10817167,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second deadliest cancerglobally and has the third-highest incidenceand mortality
rate of all cancers in the United States. Patients under 50 years old are increasingly presenting with advanced-
stage CRC, which has a five-year survival rate of 14% with the current standard of care. Thus, new treatment
options, such as immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), are being explored. T cell inactivation often occurs in
tumors, leading to a poor immune response. ICB often induces a robust antitumor immune response by blocking
T cell inactivation in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic CRC. This high response rate
is due to an immune cell-mediated inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) in these patients. However, a
majority of CRC patients have an immune-suppressive TME, rendering ICB ineffective. As such, the long-term
goal of this project is to understand and to modulate the T cell compartment to improve ICB responses in CRC
patients that are typically non-responders to ICB therapy via non-coding RNAs. The objective of the proposal is
to convert immune cell-depleted colon tumors into immune cell-enriched ones by manipulating T cell microRNA-
155 (miR-155), a classically proinflammatory microRNA (miRNA), and its targets. The central hypothesis is that
T cell microRNA-155 promotes a Th1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-enriched TME in colon cancer by
inhibiting Th2 cell polarization and promoting ICB response. We also hypothesize that Ship1, a canonical miR-
155 target, promotes the proinflammatory TME by increasing IFNγ production fromTh1 cells and CTLs to reduce
tumor growth. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data that correlate T cell gene signatures in human CRC
with miR-155, which is necessary for antitumor immunity and ICB responses against colon cancer in our mouse
models. The rationale for this work is that by altering T cell miRNAs or their downstreamtargets, we can promote
inflammatory immune cell infiltration into the colon TME. Subsequently, an ICB response can be elicited in colon
cancer patients regardless of MSI status.
Based on our preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) determine
whether T cell miR-155 inhibits Th2 cell polarization, promoting ICB responses in a mouse model of colon cancer,
and 2) determine whether inhibiting SHIP-1, a T cell miR-155 target, promotes antitumor immunity, enhances
ICB responses, and restricts tumor growth. This study is innovative as it aims to study MSI-H associated miR-
155 and SHIP-1 expression in the context of T cells, the primary target of ICB therapy. The proposed research
is significant because it addresses the need for new therapeutic targets to potentiate ICB responses in non-
responsive CRC patients."

Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people and communities account for the vast majority of HIV cases in the
United States, with Black and Latinx people being disproportionately affected. Unfortunately these communities
also experience a host of negative societal factors. Therefore, the next generation of HIV behavioral and social
science researchers must have cutting edge knowledge of the complex factors that influence HIV prevention
and care within SGM communities, and possess the interdisciplinary research skills and experiences needed
to develop innovative and effective approaches to ending the HIV epidemic. This proposed NIMH Research
Education Mentoring Program for HIV/AIDS Researchers (R25) is named Student Opportunities for AIDS/HIV
Research (SOAR). It is a multi-component theory-based 2-year long research-intensive program for University
of Michigan undergraduate students who will participate in faculty mentored research experiences and other
evidence-based programs and activities during their junior and senior years. They will remain connected to
SOAR after graduation and into their graduate programs through our interactive SOAR website, and will
provide mentoring and role-modeling for current students. Recruitment of students will focus on individuals
from NIH-designated groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social
sciences (URM: NOT-OD-20-031). Given the program's thematic focus on HIV-centered behavioral and social
science research priorities within SGM communities, we will also encourage participation from URM students
who identify as SGM (NOT-OD-19-139). SOAR is grounded in the expanded Social Cognitive Career Theory
(e-SCCT); patterned after the evidence-based U.S. Department of Education funded Ronald E. McNair Post-
baccalaureate Achievement Program; and incorporates elements of the evidence-based research mentoring
program Entering Mentoring and the evidence-based research mentee program Entering Research. The
program will be located in the University of Michigan Office of Research's Institute for Research on Women
and Gender, and be a collective effort across four prestigious and researcher-intensive UM Colleges and
Schools—School of Public Health; School of Nursing; School of Social Work; and College of Literature Science
& the Arts. SOAR was designed to advance the priorities in FY 2021–2025 NIH Strategic Plan for HIV and HIV-
Related Research, the NIMH Division of AIDS Research Priority Areas, and Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan
for America. We will provide the two-year SOAR program to four cohorts of 20 undergraduate students for a
total of 80 SOAR graduates. Specific Aims are as follows: (1) To fully develop and deliver a multi-component
theory-based HIV research education mentoring program for URM undergraduate students who will participate
in two consecutive years of faculty-mentored research experiences and other evidence-based programs and
activities during their junior and senior years. (2) To guide URM undergraduate students into career trajectories
as independent researchers in the mental health of HIV/AIDS. (3) To provide evidence-based culturally aware
mentor training for faculty, staff, graduate students, and undergraduate students as peer mentors themselves."
11033208,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes are characterized by hematopoietic aplasia and predisposition to
myelodysplasia. These disorders are underdiagnosed, and the only curative treatment is hematopoietic stem
cell transplant. In order to understand the mechanisms that mediate bone marrow failure and clonal evolution,
this proposal focuses on Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome (SDS), a bone marrow failure and MDS predisposition
syndrome caused by biallelic mutations in the SBDS gene. This gene encodes a protein that regulates ribosome
maturation. The SBDS protein specifically promotes formation of the mature, translationally active 80S ribosome
by aiding in catalysis of removal of EIF6 from the 60S ribosomal subunit. Preliminary data presented in this
proposal has identified recurrent and persistent somatic missense mutations in EIF6 and TP53 within the bone
marrow of patients with SDS. The most common EIF6 mutation leads to a loss of function and abolishes EIF6
binding with the 60S ribosomal subunit and improves SDS cell fitness, identifying a novel target for SDS therapy.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that inherited bone marrow failure syndromes have decreased
hematopoietic cell fitness determined by the inherited molecular defect and somatic mutations specifically rescue
the underlying fitness defect or bypass cell stress pathways. The proposal addresses this hypothesis with the
following specific aims: (1) Identify the hematopoietic cell of origin and hematopoietic consequences of EIF6 and
TP53 somatic mutations in SDS. (2) Evaluate the disruption of the EIF6:60S interaction and decreased EIF6
protein stability in SDS. In the first aim, single cell DNA sequencing combined with DNA-barcoded
immunophenotyping will be used to determine clonal architecture and a single cell genotype-phenotype of
somatic mutations in the SDS bone marrow. In the second aim, rational de novo designed miniproteins will be
used to interrogate EIF6:60S binding as a therapeutic strategy. Data generated from this study will inform the
pathophysiology and treatment of SDS-associated bone marrow failure and can be applied to inform treatment
of other bone marrow failure syndromes, the study of clonal hematopoiesis and ribosome maturation. A K08
award will provide the candidate with protected time to complete additional academic training in computational
biology, somatic genomic analysis and high-throughput proteomics approaches. A detailed career development
plan is proposed which will enable the candidate to attain additional scientific expertise noted above and training
in grant-writing, leadership and management skills. The proposed studies will take place at the Dana-
Farber/Boston Children's Hospital Cancer and Blood disorders center, an exemplary location to acquire
additional training. The candidate has protected research time and strong institutional support. In addition, the
candidate will have access to the Harvard Medical School-affiliated Broad Institute and Institute for Protein
Innovation. These institutions are world renowned clinical and research centers that will enable the candidate to
develop additional data and training to become an independent physician-scientist studying bone marrow failure."
10833079,"Objective: The proposed study will determine the efficacy of methylphenidate (MPH) for the treatment of
epilepsy-related attentional dysfunction. Epilepsy patients often have attention and other cognitive deficits,
which can impair quality of life. The causes are typically multifactorial, including frequent seizures, interictal
discharges, brain lesions, and antiseizure medication side effects. The comorbidity of attentional dysfunction
and epilepsy may be partially explained by abnormalities in ascending reticular activating system networks.
There are no FDA-approved medical therapies for epilepsy-related cognitive deficits, and rehabilitation
strategies provide limited benefit. MPH is a stimulant, FDA-approved for the treatment of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It is unknown, however, if stimulants would be of benefit for epilepsy-related
cognitive dysfunction. Studies of MPH in children with epilepsy and ADHD suggest efficacy and safety.
Further, large database and registry studies found beneficial effects of MPH on seizure risk in children with
and without epilepsy. Small, single-dose and open label trials of MPH in adults with epilepsy and attentional
dysfunction suggest benefit and safety, but longer-duration, controlled trials with larger numbers of subjects
are needed.
The proposed study is a multi-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of MPH, with an open-
label extension period, to determine the efficacy of MPH for adult epilepsy-related attentional dysfunction. The
study will also establish the effects of MPH on other attention-dependent cognitive processes ({i.e., a
combined measure of} memory, psychomotor speed, and executive function) and quality of life. The
hypothesis is that subjects will have improved cognitive function and quality of life with MPH compared to
placebo. Secondary analyses will determine the impact of MPH on mood and subjective cognitive abilities,
efficacy over an open-label period, and safety, including effects on seizure frequency.
Research Plan/Methods: Subjects will include {186} adults with epilepsy and self-reported cognitive
deficits, recruited from the Manhattan, Portland, Miami, and Boston VA hospitals. In the blinded phase,
subjects will {be randomly assigned to} receive either placebo or MPH (titrated to 20 mg twice daily) for 8
weeks. Subjects will then receive open-label MPH for 8 weeks (titrated to 20 mg twice daily). Cognitive testing
will be administered at baseline, the end of blinded treatment (Week 8), and the end of the open-label period
(Week 16). The cognitive battery will include tests of attention (Continuous Performance Test), memory (MCG
Paragraph Test), psychomotor speed (Symbol Digit Modalities Test), and a combined measure of divided
attention, psychomotor speed, and response inhibition (Stroop Color Word Interference Test). Additional
measures will include quality of life (Quality of Life in Epilepsy Patient Inventory-89), side effects (Adverse
Events Profile), mood (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and anxiety Beck Anxiety Inventory). Twenty healthy
subjects and 20 epilepsy patients without cognitive complaints, who will not receive the study drug, will be
included to control for repeated testing.
Clinical Relevance: If efficacious, MPH would be the first successful medical treatment for epilepsy-related
cognitive deficits. Results will be of particular importance to combat Veterans and others with head injuries, as
common sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are seizures and neuropsychological dysfunction. Improving
cognition in Veterans with epilepsy can lead to greater independence with activities of daily living, increased
employability, and better quality of life."
10909813,"Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric illness that also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Cardiovascular and metabolic disease is the leading cause of premature death for veterans with schizophrenia.
Although cellular and genetic studies have suggested that metabolic impairments may underlie neural and
cardiac dysfunction, studies in clinical neuroscience are limited. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
is widely used as a clinical research tool and has identified aberrant activity across brain networks that may
underlie psychiatric symptoms. Aberrant brain activity in schizophrenia is inefficient: excessive hemodynamic
recruitment at rest and deficient hemodynamic recruitment during cognitively demanding tasks. However, fMRI
does not assay neural activity directly, and instead, reflects slow changes in the regional level of blood oxygen
(hemodynamics) commonly interpreted as a surrogate for neural activity. Moreover, these vascular brain
signals are influenced by systemic physiology, including cardiac activity under the control of the autonomic
nervous system (ANS). Therefore, brain inefficiency in schizophrenia (as measured using fMRI) might reflect
cardiovascular dysfunction or inefficiency in the coupling of neural activity to vascular blood flow. In turn, brain
inefficiency may underlie cognitive deficits, the leading cause of functional impairment in schizophrenia.
 Vascular signals from fMRI are typically modeled to reflect neurovascular coupling, the recruitment of
blood and oxygen to support active neural tissue. Stress signals within the ANS delay neurovascular coupling
in the brain and increase heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac output to meet behavioral demands. In
schizophrenia, ANS signals are dysregulated, and neurovascular coupling is delayed, while at rest. The
relationships between neural, hemodynamic, and ANS activity are unknown in schizophrenia; new approaches
are needed to understand neurovascular coupling and the relationship to ANS stress physiology.
Electroencephalography (EEG) can measure neural activity directly, and when used concurrently with fMRI
(EEG-fMRI), is a promising research tool for examining neurovascular coupling. Continuous blood pressure
monitoring (CBP) can be used to examine the ANS function, but links between CBP derived measure of ANS
function and neurovascular coupling in the brain are unknown. This CDA-2 proposal hypothesizes that
neurovascular coupling is inefficient in schizophrenia, can be measured using simultaneous CBP-EEG-fMRI
and is mediated by dysregulated ANS activity as assayed by CBP.
 This CDA-2 enables a path to scientific independence by examining the role of neurovascular and
autonomic function in relation to cognitive and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia. Treatments targeting
underlying pathology in schizophrenia are lacking and current pharmacotherapies exacerbate metabolic
disease. Measures of neurovascular coupling may serve as a biomarker to guide novel treatments, leading to
new perspectives on the intersection between cardiovascular disease and mental health. This five-year CDA-2
provides training in the acquisition and analysis of ANS physiology with ongoing training in simultaneous EEG-
fMRI. The career and training plan will develop the Principal Investigator’s experience in ANS physiology and
multimodal neuroimaging through coursework, methodological workshops, and collaboration with established
investigators. This study combines modalities (CBP, EEG and fMRI) to achieve three specific aims: 1) Examine
neurovascular coupling in schizophrenia and healthy veterans at rest and during cognitive stress, 2) Assess
the role of ANS function in schizophrenia and healthy veterans during cognitive stress and 3) Determine
associations between autonomic dysregulation, neurovascular coupling, and psychiatric symptoms. All aims
support the primary goal of mentored training in heart-brain health to develop scientific independence and
expertise in the role of stress on neurovascular and cardiovascular function in psychiatric illness."

much as four times higher than the civilian population and report greater sun exposures, more
frequent sunburns, and lower use of sun protection. Skin cancer incidence is therefore
anticipated to continue increasing among Veterans. Unlike other cancer types, patients will often
develop multiple skin cancers, and half of skin cancer-related deaths occur among those with 10
or more skin cancers. Skin cancer risk is heterogeneous, but little progress has been made in
determining which patient will develop numerous skin cancers.
 Patients with 10 or more skin cancers have a 25% risk of metastasis. Studying
populations with a high prevalence of multiple skin cancers can provide clues to mechanisms of
multiple skin cancer development. Organ transplant recipients (OTR) have up to 100-fold
greater rates of skin cancer than non-OTR. This increase is believed to be due to both
immunosuppression and decreased DNA repair caused by immunosuppressants. Exposure to
specific immunosuppressants is associated with varying risks of skin cancer, although how their
metabolism affects the number of skin cancers is unknown. Further, it is unclear if other factors
present at the time of transplant can identify individuals at high risk for multiple skin cancers
who would benefit from aggressive primary prevention. This study will use VINCI and MVP data
to address the critical knowledge gap of how to identify Veterans at risk of developing 10 or
more skin cancers a priori to reduce their skin cancer morbidity and mortality.
 The overall goal of this CDA-2 is to advance the personalized management of skin
cancer in organ transplant recipients and provide clues to mechanisms of disease in the broader
Veteran population. Our long-term goal is to deploy precision medicine management strategies
to reduce skin cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality among both Veterans with organ
transplants and Veterans overall. In Aim 1, we will identify patterns of clinical factors present at
the time of transplant that are associated with skin cancer development. In Aim 2, we will
investigate how variation in metabolism of immunosuppressant medications impacts the number
of skin cancers a patient will develop. In Aim 3, we will examine the role of rare genetic variants
in developing 10 or more skin cancers.
 The Tennessee Valley Healthcare System Nashville VA and Vanderbilt are an ideal
environment to support Dr. Wheless for this proposal and his transition to an independent
physician scientist. Both hospitals are high-volume transplant centers and house strong
bioinformatics infrastructure and expertise. The Department of Dermatology strongly supports
Dr. Wheless’s career development. His mentors, Drs. Hung, Chren, and Matheny, are
internationally recognized in dermatology, genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics with
successful mentoring track records. These mentors, along with the mentoring committee, have
developed a rigorous training plan in genetic epidemiology and pharmacogenomics with didactic
and hands-on learning activities. With strong institutional support, Dr. Wheless will successfully
leverage his proposal to obtain Merit funding."
10814211,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular
disease. The largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. Medication errors result in 3 million
outpatient medical appointments, 1 million emergency department visits, and 125,000 hospital admissions
each year. Astoundingly, over 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed every year in the United States alone.
Although dispensing error rates are generally low at 0.06%, the sheer volume of dispensed medications
translates to 2.4 million incorrectly dispensed medications each year. In the pharmacy, dispensing errors arise
when pharmacists do not detect that the medication filled inside a prescription vial is different from the
medication ordered on the prescription's label. These dispensing errors can result in patient harm, added strain
on the healthcare system, and costly legal action against the pharmacy.
Machine intelligence (MI) can be employed to assist in the verification process to help avoid dangerous and
costly pharmacy dispensing errors.4–6 However for the human-MI partnership to function optimally, the MI
should be capable of conveying accurate information that encourages providers to make sound cognitive
decisions such that optimal trust is maintained, and temporal and cognitive demand is reduced. Imperative to
this goal is to design MI from which interpretable information can be extracted, convey this information in an
effective manner and calibrate user's trust in MI as either over-trust or under-trust can lead to near miss and
incident errors.
This proposed project will further our knowledge for designing interpretable MI outputs and inform the
development of MI models that encourage pharmacy staff to make sound clinical decisions that lead to better
patient outcomes while improving work-life at lower costs of care. This study develops interpretable MI
methods in the context of medication images classification and designs effective MI advice and reasoning that
lead to lower cognitive demand and increased trust in the MI. Our hypothesis is that interpretable MI will lead to
improved work performance and more calibrated trust compared to uninterpretable M. The objectives of this
proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in
real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine
intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work
performance."

 Marijuana use among youth has been increasing, with considerably enlarged disparities across
racial/ethnic groups. Racial minorities like African American (AA) adolescents are more likely to report
marijuana use than their White peers. Marijuana use during adolescence can harm brain development and
lead to other substance abuse and adverse health outcomes. In order to identify potential targets for
interventions to reduce health disparities, there is a critical need to distinguish risk and protective factors for
marijuana use that are specific to race and ethnicity. With a shifting legal environment for marijuana use in the
United States and more adults supporting marijuana legalization, it is estimated that 8.2% of mothers and 9.6%
of fathers living with adolescent offspring reported past-year marijuana use. The family environment is a major
driver of youth development, and racial and ethnic families often experience greater exposure to systemic
oppression (e.g., institutional and interpersonal racism, bias, and discrimination) and higher social inequality
than their White peers, resulting in acute and chronic stress. Therefore, we hypothesize that parental
marijuana use independently predicts offspring marijuana and other substance use, and intergenerational
effects of marijuana use may be stronger among racial and ethnic families, especially among AA families. The
overarching goal of this mixed-methods sequential explanatory study is to assess racial disparities in
relationships between parental marijuana use and youth substance use. In Aim 1, we will leverage a
longitudinally national survey with 5 waves of parent and offspring data (n≈3,272) to examine the
intergenerational association between G1 marijuana use and subsequent G2 marijuana, vaping, tobacco, and
other illicit drug use across distinct racial/ethnic groups (AAs, H/Ls vs. non-Hispanic Whites). In Aim 2, we will
assess moderation and mediation effects from marijuana legalization status and other determinants (e.g.,
discrimination and psychological distress) across racial/ethnic groups. In Aim 3, we will conduct semi-
structured interviews of parent marijuana users and their offspring (n≈96 each) to qualitatively examine the
intersections of parent influences and policy change on youth substance use. Analyses of intergenerational
and longitudinal surveys and semi-structured interviews will be fully integrated to complement each other and
provide more robust findings. This study is innovative in its focus on assessing racial disparities in the
intergenerational transmission of marijuana use in AAs and H/Ls, two NIH-designated health disparity
populations. This study is also timely in responding to the rapidly shifting policy environment, rising marijuana
use among youth and adults, and growing disparities by racial/ethnic group, with unknown etiology on the
intergenerational drug use by racial/ethnic groups. The findings will inform the development of a future R01 to
test tailored strategies to prevent youth marijuana and other substance use and reduce health disparities.

10788381,"Bi-functional photo-crosslinking (BFPX) for genome-wide study of protein-nucleic acid interactions
For a given cell at a certain state, what proteins bind to the genomic DNA and where they bind in the genomic
sequence are fundamental questions to understanding cellular functions and disease mechanisms. To
address these questions, a variety of techniques have been developed to capture protein-DNA complexes
for analyses and identifications. However, most of the current technologies depend on the capture of protein-
DNA complexes by formaldehyde crosslinking. Increasing evidence suggests that formaldehyde fixation
could be a major problem undermining the effectiveness of the current approaches. This is largely due to the
highly reactive and non-specific damages to proteins by formaldehyde and its inability to crosslink DNA to
proteins. DNA captured by formaldehyde is not covalently linked to protein but trapped in fixed protein
complexes, which can lead to the capture of a large amount of non-specific DNA fragments which will mask
the real signals (). Direct UV crosslinking of protein to DNA and RNA have recently been reported, but these
approaches are limited by the low crosslinking efficiency and the use of short wavelength UVC (~250 nm)
that damages proteins and nucleic acids. There is a critical unmet research need for molecular tools and
technologies that can capture protein-DNA complexes in cells with high efficiency, selectivity (i.e., only
targeting DNA-bound proteins) and stability (to enable robust isolation of protein-DNA complexes for
subsequent analyses). The proposed research seek to develop a class of bi-functional photo-crosslinking
probes (BFPX) that are cell and nuclear permeable, inert to cellular molecules in the absence of UV, bind and
enrich on DNA or RNA, and under illumination with long wavelength UVA (~360nm), become activated to
form covalent adduct to DNA or RNA and at the same time to crosslink nearby proteins bound to DNA or
RNA through highly efficient photochemical reactions. These molecular probes will serve as powerful tools for
robust capture of protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes in a wide range of in situ studies of protein-
nucleic acid interactions."
10813014,"Abstract
Our research focuses on molecular recognition, with the goal of providing methods and software for solving
biomedical problems. The primary areas of interest are protein-protein interactions and the ligand binding
properties of proteins. We believe that predictive methods will be substantially improved during the next five
years due to the increasing amount of information on sequences, structures, and interactions of molecules in
the cell, and the unprecedented availability of computing power. To take advantage of these opportunities we
will integrate the use of structural templates, co-evolutionary information, and machine learning into classical
biophysical methods. Our rigid body protein docking server ClusPro, which has over 15,000 users, will be
combined with our new template based server ClusPro TBM. We also add elements of flexible docking, either
by remodeling the regions that cause steric conflicts, or by using a neural net for calculating post-minimization
energy values without performing the actual minimization. Several tools will be combined for the structural
analysis of protein interaction networks, including a novel method of constructing multi-protein complexes
based on pre-calculated tables of interaction energies between pairs of proteins. Examples of applications
include the design of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) for modulating a target protein by
degradation, the prediction of antibody epitopes, and searching for epitope-specific antibodies. To study the
ligand binding properties of proteins we focus on binding hot spots, regions of proteins that are major
contributors to the binding free energy. Our FTMap server globally samples the surface of target proteins using
fragment sized molecular probes and provides reliable hot spot and pharmacophore information. We will
improve the scoring function using neural nets, and expand the set of probes to obtain generalized
pharmacophores that identify regions in the protein binding site with preferences for specific functional groups
and a number of bound fragments. Since this information can be used to find larger ligands, the goal is to
convert FTMap into a fragment based ligand discovery platform. We will also improve our template-based
server LigTBM, which docks small molecules to proteins, and will integrate template-based modeling with
FTMap. In a collaborative application we will analyze metabolite-protein interaction data obtained by precision
mass spectrometry in E. coli and human protein pull-down experiments. FTMap will be used to test whether a
target protein has a suitable binding hot spot, and LigTBM will place the metabolite. We are particularly
interested in finding metabolites that bind at novel allosteric regulatory sites. A related application will be to
study ensembles of structures obtained by dynamic simulations to find potential correlations between FTMap
derived binding properties at different regions of proteins, thus exploring potential allosteric communication."

Significance: The Knee Biofeedback Rehabilitation Interface for Game-based Home Therapy (“KneeBRIGHT”)
system combines electromyography (EMG) biofeedback with video game therapy (VGT) to provide knee
osteoarthritis (OA) patients with an engaging, effective tool for conducting rehabilitation exercises at home.
KneeBRIGHT aims to motivate OA patients to conduct regular muscle strengthening exercise through an
engaging, EMG-driven virtual worlds therapy. The system combines wireless EMG electrodes that are
convenient for patients to use in a home setting with software that provides automated guidance through
evidence-based, progressive exercise routines. Importantly, these exercises are presented to the patient in the
form of fun and engaging activities to promote a positive experience and encourage continued adherence.
Problem to be Addressed: OA is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Rehabilitation through
quadriceps strengthening is a well-established, effective treatment for knee OA but patient adherence to exercise
routines is low due to lack of guidance regarding optimal protocols and lack of engagement during the repetitive
routines that patients find tedious and boring. Unsupervised, home-based exercise is particularly challenging.
Innovative, engaging solutions are needed to enable and facilitate home participation, especially given the
increased the use of telehealth due to the COVID19 pandemic.
Phase II Results: The Phase II effort successfully developed a full-featured KneeBRIGHT system and deployed
it in a 10-week randomized, controlled trial with knee OA patients. Participants using the KneeBRIGHT system
for exercise increased their home exercise session participation by 20% compared to the control group. The study
also demonstrated very positive usability ratings and positive trends in strength and balance outcomes.
Phase IIB Program Summary: The proposed Phase IIB effort will yield a commercial KneeBRIGHT system
supporting home-based physical therapy for knee OA. New developments will include: game enhancements to
expand exercise options and device compatibility; upgraded sensor features; a secure provider dashboard web
application for monitoring and guiding therapy; and HIPAA compliant cloud services integration. Pursuit of
federal regulatory approval for the new device will include documentation of safety, creation of a user’s guide
and other FDA labeling, and completion of actions supporting premarket notification. To establish acceptance
by physical therapy practitioners, a network of multiple knee OA physical therapy providers will participate in
a randomized, controlled clinical trial. An innovative provider-as-investigator study model will streamline
translation of research to clinical practice. The clinical trial will evaluate the ability of the KneeBRIGHT system,
as prescribed by a variety of PTs, to achieve clinically relevant outcomes.
Impact: The system will have a substantial and sustained impact on public health by increasing knee OA patient
adherence to home exercise and thereby reducing pain and restoring physical function."

The overarching objective of this proposal is to investigate a novel mechanism for sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy (SUDEP). Our laboratory recently made the unexpected discovery that mice genetically engineered for
hyperactive stress circuits exhibit an increased incidence of SUDEP, a finding that was verified to be
translationally relevant from observed neuroendocrine abnormalities in patients that died of confirmed or
suspected SUDEP. Given that both stress and SUDEP link to disruption of central circuits responsible for the
regulation of cardiorespiratory function, we propose that exaggerated activity of central stress circuits on
downstream brainstem autonomic control centers represents a novel mechanism contributing to increased
SUDEP risk. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus
(PVN) are at the apex of the stress axis and project directly to brainstem regions critical for autonomic regulation,
including the nucleus of the solitary tract (PVN-NTSCRH). PVN-NTSCRH has a well-established role in integrating
cardiorespiratory responses to stress, making them a likely driver of cardiorespiratory dysfunction related to
central stress axis hyperexcitability and, potentially, SUDEP. In fact, our preliminary data demonstrate that
chemogenetic activation of PVN-NTSCRH increases SUDEP incidence. The current application will build on the
expertise of, Drs. Jamie Maguire and Carie Boychuk, to test the hypothesis that HPA axis hyperexcitability in
chronically epileptic mice increases the risk for SUDEP through increased PVN-NTSCRH drive, exaggerating
cardiac vagal output during homeostatic challenges. We will investigate this hypothesis by examining whether
there is increased PVN-NTSCRH drive associated with SUDEP risk and whether excessive activation of this
pathway is sufficient to increase SUDEP incidence. We will interrogate potential, novel pathophysiological
mechanisms mediating the impact of hyperactive stress circuits on SUDEP risk by examining the impact on
cardiac vagal output. Finally, we will investigate whether environmental factors associated with hyperactive
stress circuits, such as chronic stress, can impact cardiac vagal function and SUDEP risk. This application has
the potential to uncover a novel mechanism contributing to SUDEP risk, which may also be relevant to other
forms of sudden death."

This randomized controlled trial
(SMM)
people
 addresses social and structural inequities to reduce severe maternal morbidity
 and maternal mortality in the most at-risk patients – those that self-identify as Black, indigenous and
 of color (BIPOC). Specifically, our intervention will implement and evaluate an integrated, multi-level
maternity care home model (MCHM) that incorporates maternity care navigation, benefits navigation, social
work, doula and mental health resources all within one care-delivery model. While
evaluated
these
 previous studies have
 single social eterminants (e.g. education and insurance) or single solutions (e.g. care navigator),

d
Our study will test our central hypothesis that a patient-centered MCHM will address the gap in social, structural,
and health system factors that contribute to disparities for our most vulnerable BIPOC patients, thereby reducing
SMM. Totest the effectiveness of this MCHM and ensure timely uptake of the results, we propose a type 1 hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of an integrated MCHM that
provides a comprehensive approach by partnering a unified model of social and structural service delivery with
medical service delivery in all prenatal offices affiliated with the two largest birthing hospitals in Philadelphia.
Within this study we will determine the effectiveness of an integrated MCHM in reducing SMM among BIPOC
patients (Aim 1). Patients will be randomized (n=2300) to a MCHM (office-based prenatal care that is integrated
with social services within the MCHM) or standard of care (office-based prenatal care with individually outsourced
social services referrals) and followed throughout pregnancy and for 1 year postpartum. To determine
mechanisms by which this integrated MCHM impacts SMM (Sub-Aim 1a), we will evaluate numerous factors that
could plausibly mitigate the effects of health system failures, provider bias and adverse social conditions (e.g.
improved health system access, care coordination). We will also characterize patient, provider and organizational
implementation determinants relevant to an integrated MCHM and identify barriers and facilitators to
implementation and sustainability (Aim 2) as well as determine resource utilization and total cost/cost savings
associated with the MCHM (Sub-Aim 2a) by partnering with commercial and Medicaid payers.
Importantly,
delivery
intrapartum
the results of the proposed study will provide actionable evidence to support effective maternity care
 that results in optimal and equitable outcomes, thereby revolutionizing the way in which prenatal,
 and postpartum care is delivered and experienced. Additionally, even if the trial is negative in
reducing SMM, there are still numerous other potential benefits to an integrated MCHM (including many of the
secondary outcomes we are evaluating) and we will have therefore collected valuable information to inform the
implementation of this model into clinical practice."

Severe, progressive kidney diseases (CKD) are more common among Black patients than in other populations.
The excess risk for non-diabetic CKD in this population is explained, in part, by the presence of genetic variants
in the APOL1 gene, which are unique to some African ancestral populations. The APOL1 high risk (HR)
genotype, defined as the presence of two risk alleles (G1 or G2), is strongly associated with some idiopathic
proteinuric podocytopathies, primarily FSGS. The pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the genetic
association remain poorly understood, although over-expression systems suggest kidney diseases result from
HR variant-dependent cytotoxicity. However published data suggest that both loss-of protection and gain of toxic
function pathways may mediate APOL-associated kidney diseases. To develop hypotheses about mechanisms,
we characterized the G0 and G2 spatial proteomes using peroxidase-catalyzed proximity labelling and mass
spectrometry to identify candidate APOL1-regulated pathways in HeLa cells with regulated APOL1 expression.
APOL1 induction did not cause cell death as assayed by a method agnostic to death mechanism or by an
apoptosis-specific assay. The compositions of the G0 and G2 spatial proteomes are markedly enriched in
secretory pathway membrane and luminal proteins but their protein neighborhoods diverge in the Golgi where
G0 and HR-APOL1s are loaded into a subset of RAB6+ vesicles. The G0 and G2 spatial proteomes suggest that
cargos of these vesicles are APOL1-isoform specific, with G0 but not G2 being in proximity of cell surface
proteins. Using a N-hydroxysuccinimide biotin ester enrichment method, we demonstrated G2 expression altered
cell surface proteins with functional consequences. Interference reflectance microscopy suggests G2 expressing
but not G0 expressing cells fail to maintain adhesion. Importantly, these phenotypes are recapitulated in isogenic
IPSC-derived podocytes with G0, G1 and G2 genotypes. Based on these data, we hypothesize that APOL1
regulates podocyte surfaceome to maintain podocyte adhesion and differentiated functions. G2 fails to do this
resulting in podocyte depletion and progressive podocytopathy. We propose the following experiments to better
understand APOL1 reference and kidney risk variant function: Aim 1: Use stable isotope labelling by amino acids
in cell culture (SILAC) and mass spectrometry to characterize the surface proteome of podocytes expressing
APOL1-G0, G1 and G2 variants in the presence and absence of Interferon-γ. Aim 2: Characterize the RAB6A+
post-Golgi vesicular compartment using biochemical and microscopic methods to define the differential
trafficking of RAB6A+ vesicles and the associated cargo that is dependent upon APOL1 genotype. Aim 3: Prove
that the APOL1 isoform-specific cargos in RAB6+ vesicles regulate the podocyte surfaceome and define the
APOL1–dependent mechanisms for the podocyte adhesion defect."

 Preventing suicide is one of the great public health challenges facing the US health care
system. People who seek emergency care for mental health complaints are at high short-term
risk of non-fatal suicide events and suicide. Yet identifying high-risk patients is challenging as
risk fluctuates in a poorly understood manner. It is especially difficult to evaluate risk in
emergency settings, where access to the patient's mental health history is often limited. The
proposed project seeks to address this critical knowledge gap by pairing data mining and
machine learning methods with rich data sources in order to develop short-term prediction
models of non-fatal suicidal events and suicide for patients presenting to EDs with mental health
problems.
 The specific aims of this study are to 1) apply advanced machine learning data analytic
techniques to electronic health record (EHR) data to develop a clinically rich description of ED
mental health patient characteristics that predict suicide and non-fatal suicidal events over a 90-
day follow-up period; 2) use longitudinal and temporal features of EHR and claims data from the
180 days preceding the ED mental health visit to generate clinically interpretable suicide and
suicidal event risk scores; and 3) convene ED physicians to enhance model development,
clinical interpretability, and utility of a suicide risk assessment clinical decision support tool.
 We will achieve these aims by leveraging several different sophisticated machine learning
analytic methods of existing longitudinal clinical and service use information. We seek to
develop point-in-time, short-term risk scores for suicidal symptoms and suicide death and the
clinical features that drive that risk that may be used to inform clinical risk assessment and
management of patients who present to EDs with mental health complaints. Risk algorithms will
be developed and validated using health information from a large combined EHR and claims
dataset with over 24 million commercially insured patients, which is linked to the National Death
Index. Findings will yield new insights regarding patient-specific risk factors and potential targets
for intervention. By drawing on data sources common to most health care systems and using
efficient computer algorithms this approach has the potential to develop clinically interpretable
suicide risk scores at the point of ED evaluation and following disposition. This will help front-
line clinicians focus their efforts on high risk patients during high risk periods to inform
intervention decisions about suicide risk."

Serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) causes atherosclerotic heart disease. As the LDL receptor (LDLR) on the
liver clears LDL from the blood, upregulating hepatic LDLR reduces both LDL and cardiovascular events. The
self-cleaving protease PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is a validated therapeutic target; it
chaperones the LDLR for lysosomal degradation, downregulating its function. Antibodies against PCSK9 lower
LDL and improve clinical outcomes, but cost and administration requirements illustrate a need for alternatives.
Liver-targeted siRNA also robustly lowers LDL, but unlike the well-tolerated genetic variants, it removes all
PCSK9 from the cell, raising safety concerns. Though the mechanistic basis for PCSK9's effect on the hepatic
LDLR is well understand, its functions outside this canonical pathway are less clear. Therefore, the overall
goal of our proposal is to develop biochemical tools to mechanistically dissect the biology of PCSK9, so as to
1) anticipate the long-term effects of current anti-PCSK9 therapies and 2) develop the proofs-of-principle for
novel PCSK9-targeting strategies. To this end, we have identified three promising lead compounds that
specifically target intracellular PCSK9. These compounds both inhibit PCSK9 self-proteolysis and also
upregulate LDLR expression. In Aim 1, we will chemically optimize these compounds, confirm the mechanistic
basis of their effects, and validate their function on PCSK9 and the LDLR in an in vivo model. This will
establish novel chemical probes which can be used to study the poorly known function of intracellular PCSK9,
as well as serve as the starting point for an alternative small molecule therapeutic to upregulate the LDLR. We
have also found that additional factors, including heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), interact with PCSK9
to modulate its trafficking to the lysosome, suggesting that there are additional drug targets in this pathway. In
Aim 2, we will evaluate the contribution of HSPGs as mediators of the PCSK9 endocytic trafficking required for
LDLR downregulation, both in vitro and in the human. These results will elucidate whether heparins, which are
already approved therapies, could be repurposed to inhibit PCSK9 function. In Aim 3, we will identify and
validate as yet unknown regulators of PCSK9 endocytic trafficking via an unbiased, genome-wide CRISPR
interference screen. These results will help mechanistically define how PCSK9 is trafficked to the lysosome,
provide answers to why PCSK9 only affects certain tissues, and offer potential novel therapeutic targets which
would be anticipated to have similar therapeutic windows to PCSK9 itself. Overall, we expect our study to
provide key information on the safety of long-term PCSK9 inhibition, lay the groundwork for novel treatments,
and identify new therapeutic targets against atherosclerosis."

10874441,"Bipolar disorder (BD) is a psychiatric disorder associated with heritable polygenic risk factors. While clinically
heterogeneous, key clinical features of BD include disruptions in daily sleep and activity cycles indicating that
circadian rhythm disruption is an important part of the disorder in many patients. Circadian rhythms are
determined by molecular clocks comprised of “clock genes” whose expression is regulated by environmental
factors such as light and temperature. In recent years, our group and others have made progress in developing
cellular models of BD using induced pluripotent stem-cell (iPSC) derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and
neurons. We have determined that chronotype (time of day preference, “morningness”) in BD patients and
circadian rhythms in cells both predict the clinical response to lithium maintenance therapy. Using iPSC-based
methods to grow human NPCs and neurons, we found that neurons from BD patients have a hyperexcitable
phenotype that can be reversed by lithium selectively in neurons from lithium-responsive (Li-R) BD donors, but
not in cells from lithium non-responders (Li-NR). Presently, we propose to build upon this work and further
develop the iPSC-neuron model to further investigate circadian disruption in BD. In Aim 1, we will estimate the
contributions of polygenic risk factors to circadian rhythm phenotypes in BD in excitatory neurons. We will study
rhythms in iPSC-derived NPC and glutamatergic neurons grown from a well-characterized, extended family who
share high genetic risk for BD, but are discordant for the BD diagnosis. Presumably, cells from these genetically
similar individuals will contain BD risk genes across a gradient that can be quantified using polygenic risk scores
(PRS). By evaluating the relationship between PRS and rhythm parameters, we will estimate the aggregate
contributions of genetic risk for BD to the expression of circadian rhythm abnormalities. In Aim 2 we propose to
assess the contribution of BD-associated gene sets to circadian rhythms in neurons. Genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) of sleep and circadian phenotypes suggest the existence of a shared genetic basis for mood
disorders and chronotype. In this aim, we will study synchronized cells over a 24 h period to identify rhythmically
expressed genes in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from BD patients and controls and describe rhythm
differences between diagnostic groups. We expect to find that many genes change their rhythm or lose rhythms
altogether in BD neurons. We will then use a molecular biology method called siRNA knockdown to reduce the
expression of candidate genes linked to BD and the circadian clock, and assess their loss of function in circadian
rhythm assays, under constant or temperature-entrained conditions. In Aim 3 we propose to measure circadian
rhythms in iPSC-derived GABAergic medium-spiny neuron-like cells. Our previous cell-based studies of BD
employed, excitatory glutamatergic neurons. Animal models of BD show important contributions of the clock
genes on dopamine projections to inhibitory, GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSN) in the striatum. In this
aim, we will differentiate iPSCs from BD patients (Li-R and Li-NR) into inhibitory, GABAergic MSN-like neurons
using an established, high efficiency protocol. We will use the Per2-luc circadian rhythm reporter to measure
rhythms in live human GABAergic neurons for the first time and assess the effects of mood stabilizing drugs
such as lithium and antipsychotic drugs upon them. At the conclusion of the study, we will have a more advanced
understanding of which neurons lose rhythms in BD, which BD-risk genes are involved in the circadian disruption,
and how circadian disruption affects the function of neurons. This information may help to better identify lithium-
responsive BD patients and link them efficiently to effective treatments."

Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury is a major life-threatening condition with no effective therapy to date. The
host responses to sepsis are wide-ranging, cell-type dependent, and importantly, temporally distinct. These
cellular and molecular responses to sepsis can favorably or negatively affect host fitness. However, the
distinction between adaptive and maladaptive responses is often not apparent a priori, and the same response
may have opposite implications depending on where the patient is in the timeline of sepsis. Our current studies
using a range of omics approaches have identified that altered polyamine metabolism is a prominent feature of
sepsis-induced acute kidney injury. Polyamines, namely putrescine, spermidine and spermine, are involved in
a multitude of fundamental biological processes such as protein synthesis and redox regulation both in host
and pathogens. Our data demonstrate that modulation of polyamine metabolism can significantly influence the
outcome of kidney injury in a highly complex manner, highlighting the need for better understanding the
principles of polyamine metabolism in time and space during sepsis. Accordingly, in Specific Aim 1 of this
proposal, we will examine the effects of modulating polyamines on kidney function across the timeline of
sepsis. We will test the hypothesis that therapeutic effects of polyamine modulation are temporally distinct and
have opposing effects between early and late phase sepsis. Furthermore, to enable a transition to clinical
therapeutic applications, we will seek to define the stages of sepsis using a novel time-sensitive molecular
fingerprint that is linked to the status of polyamine metabolism. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the
genome-wide molecular effects of polyamine modulation in the kidney with a primary focus on their impact on
protein synthesis. Global mapping of polyamine-dependent translational changes could bridge our knowledge
gap between large scale phenomena such as altered kidney function as investigated in Aim 1 and the
molecular regulation afforded by polyamines at codon-level resolution."
10819137,"N-methyltransferase (NNMT), a key enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway with unclear functions, is
expressed highly and specifically in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). We found that NNMT is robustly
elevated when BLBC cells detach from a matrix and grow in suspension. Knockout (KO) of NNMT not only
inhibits anchorage-independent growth in vitro but also suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in animal
models. Using an unbiased CRISPR-Cas9 library screening, we identified the FOXC1-CARM1 complex as
being responsible for NNMT upregulation in BLBC. Importantly, inhibition of NNMT by either KO or use of an
inhibitor increases the proapoptotic effects mediated by chemo-drugs. We thus hypothesize that NNMT is a
critical gatekeeper that maintains NAD+ homeostasis for BLBC progression and metastasis; this homeostasis
boosts the cellular antioxidative defense machinery, and prevents surges of ROS that BLBC cells encounter
during metastasis. The objective of this proposal is to (1) characterize NNMT function in regulating NAD+
homeostasis in tumor progression and metastasis; (2) delineate the transcriptional regulation of NNMT by
the FOXC1-CARM1 complex; and (3) explore the clinical value of NNMT as a prognostic biomarker and a
druggable target for BLBC. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test this hypothesis by pursuing three
specific aims: (1) to determine the critical roles of NNMT in BLBC; (2) to delineate NNMT transcription by the
FOXC1-CARM1 complex; and (3) to define the roles of NNMT in the development of mammary gland and
breast cancer metastasis. Our proposal is innovative and significant, because NNMT represents the achilles
heel of BLBC; targeting this metabolic vulnerability offers an effective therapeutic option against metastatic
BLBC."
10829894,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 10,000 people die in alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes per year in the US. Most available evidence
identifies that access to ridesharing is associated with fewer alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes. Providing
access to subsidized rideshare trips could be a high impact intervention to reduce crash incidence and save
lives. Some municipalities have begun implementing this strategy. Theoretically, access to subsidized
ridesharing will replace trips by prospective impaired drivers by altering the financial and convenience costs of
taking alternative forms of transit compared to driving while impaired. The strength of this association will differ
according to an individuals’ income and local access to public transit. However, access to subsidized
ridesharing may produce concomitant increases in alcohol consumption because greater mobility makes it
cheaper and easier for consumers to obtain and consume alcohol. Few studies have tested these hypotheses,
and there is no evidence from experimental studies. The broad objective of this two-arm single-blinded
randomized controlled trial is to test the effects of access to subsidized ridesharing on drunk driving and
alcohol consumption. We will recruit 160 individuals through digital social media advertisements from a
stratified sample of 50 US cities (n = 8,000), including 25 cities with high access to public transit (as measured
using the Transit Score) and 25 cities with low access to public transit. Participants will (i) reside in a selected
city, (ii) be aged ≥ 21 years, (iii) have a drivers’ license and access to a motor vehicle, (iv) report consuming
alcohol at a bar in the last 7 days, (v) own a smartphone, and (vi) speak English. We will randomize
participants to receiving a $35 ridesharing voucher (the intervention group) or a $35 online shopping voucher
(the control group). We will follow participants for one week pre-intervention and one week post-intervention
using weekly surveys. A sub-sample of 2,000 participants will download a custom mobile application and will
be tracked using GPS for the two-week study period. The specific aims are 1) to test whether access to
subsidized ridesharing reduces individuals’ risks for drunk driving, 2) to test whether access to subsidized
ridesharing affects individuals’ alcohol consumption, and 3) to test whether access to ridesharing affects
individuals’ mobility, including access to retail alcohol outlets. We will assess moderation by individuals’ income
and by the Transit Score for their city of residence. The results of this study will fill important gaps in scientific
evidence regarding a disruptive technology with strong potential to be harnessed as a preventive intervention
to reduce alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes and improve public health. The work will inform the design of
interventions that use subsidized ridesharing to reduce alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes—including by
identifying the individuals who will benefit most substantially, the locations where impacts will be greatest, and
the unintended effects on alcohol consumption—and the mechanism by which the intervention achieves these
outcomes (i.e. by altering individuals’ mobility and exposure to alcohol outlets)."
10847374,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating age-related neurodegenerative disease that can severely curtail life
quality and expectancy. Depression and sleep disorders manifest decades before disease onset and may serve
as an important early biomarker. Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) exhibit
neurofibrillary changes in the early stages of AD, which may contribute to some of these early non-cognitive
symptoms. The goal of this application is to determine whether tau accumulation in 5-HT DRN neurons induces
depressive-like behaviors and disordered sleep, leading to chronic sleep disruption. These sleep deficits, in turn,
may promote hyperexcitability of 5-HT neurons and lead to neurodegeneration. The increased activity in 5-HT
neurons due to sleep deprivation also facilitates the spread of tau pathology to the entorhinal cortex (EC), another
region that is impacted early in the course of AD. Loss of 5-HT inputs from the DRN to the EC will disinhibit
neurons that project to the hippocampus, precipitating tau spread and the onset of cognitive and memory
problems. In Aim 1, we will use in vivo fiber photometry to measure neural activity in 5-HT neurons during tests
of depressive-like behavior in mouse models of tauopathy to see if the normal function of these neurons is
negatively impacted. We will also monitor 5-HT activity during sleep to see if that is altered by tau pathology. In
Aim 2, we will examine the effect of sleep deprivation on 5-HT neuronal excitability and the progression of tau
pathology in the brain using electrophysiology and 3D imaging. The role of increased neural activity in 5-HT
neurons on the spread of tau pathology will also be examined using chemogenetic manipulations of neural
activity. In Aim 3, we will determine whether tau-induced loss of 5-HT inputs to the EC alters 5-HT signaling in
principal neurons that project to the hippocampus. We will also establish a role for 5-HT/5-HT2A receptor signaling
in the spread of tau pathology to the hippocampus and the onset of cognitive deficits. In total, the proposed
research will provide essential information concerning the impact of tau pathology on early behavioral symptoms
of AD and the later development of cognitive and memory deficits."

Viral infections are now recognized as risk factors for diseases of progressive pathological forgetting,
supporting a new paradigm in neuroimmunology whereby innate immune molecules that function as
modulators of a variety of normal CNS functions induce neurodegenerative diseases during host-pathogen
responses. Studying virus-mediated cognitive dysfunction through the multidisciplinary prism of immunology,
neuroscience, and virology is critical for the identification of novel mechanisms of disease, discovery of
neuroimaging tools and therapeutic treatments for a wide range of diseases of memory disorder. In my
laboratory we made unanticipated, paradigm-shifting discoveries of the roles of CNS infiltrating mononuclear
cells in microglial-mediated synapse elimination, disrupted adult neurogenesis, and generation of neurotoxic
astrocytes using novel models of recovery from encephalitogenic flaviviruses, West Nile (WNV) and Zika
(ZIKV) viruses. We identified classical complement proteins and cytokine receptor signaling as novel molecular
mediators that regulate synapse elimination, neural stem cell (NSC) fates, neuron-microglia and microglia-
astrocyte crosstalk within cortical structures that regulate memory formation and maintenance. We have also
begun leveraging novel neuroimaging modalities to develop biomarkers that may be used to predict and
monitor patients at risk for memory disorders. Our aim is to understand the mechanisms that induce alterations
in synaptic connections and methods of repair that contribute to disruption of neuronal networks after recovery
from viral infections. Our research program focuses on three broad areas related to the roles and regulation of
innate immune molecules involved in spatial learning using novel murine models of post-infectious cognitive
dysfunction. First, using genetic, pharmacologic and PET-MRI, we will identify and define molecular
interactions between T cells and microglia or neurons that drive the generation and maintenance of resident
memory T cells that promote cognitive dysfunction. We will use scRNAseq under BSL3 conditions to screen for
genes and pathways to be targeted via cell-specific deletion of cytokine or chemokine receptors, or
administration of agents that inhibit or enhance pathways. We will also develop diagnostic tools that employ
ABSL3 PET-MRI. Second, we will define how microglia-astrocyte-NSC interactions in the context of recovery
from CNS viral infections limit repair and recovery. We will use global and conditional gene targeting in mice to
delineate the in vivo roles of cytokines in neural cell types that regulate astrocyte inflammasome activation and
its relationship to neuronal and synapse recovery. We will also define innate immune mechanisms that direct
and maintain astrogenosis during acute viral infection and recovery using PET-MRI detection of P2X7R, a
marker of reactive astrocytes. Finally, will utilize reporter mice/fate mapping, bone marrow chimeras and
scRNAseq to delineate the cytokine-mediated roles of myeloid cells in the generation of neurotoxic astrocytes
during WNND recovery. Third, we will examine innate immune mechanisms triggered after viral infections that
negatively impact cortical connectivity and determine whether neuroimaging can be used to predict and follow
this process. Specifically, we will combine genetic approaches with functional optical intrinsic signal imaging of
hemoglobin and calcium dynamics to define mechanisms that negatively impact cortical connectivity. Our
research program will define new concepts in the molecular neuroimmunological regulation of synapses, T cell
and glial interactions, inform studies of related processes throughout the nervous systems, and will likely
enhance our understanding of neurodegenerative and other disorders of memory."
10845266,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients present a formidable clinical challenge, as they
exhibit higher rates of metastatic recurrence, and respond poorly to available targeted therapies.
Given the clinical significance, it is imperative to develop effective targeted anti-metastatic
therapies for the treatment of TNBC. Metals serve as co-factors for tumor promoting pathways
and targeting metals to disable these pathways has emerged as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic
strategy. Copper, an essential trace element functions as a catalytic cofactor for a host of
metalloenzymes/proteins that contribute to tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. In addition,
increased copper uptake by malignant cells has led to the development of copper-specific
chelators as therapeutic agents. In a potentially transformative discovery, we have identified
within the primary tumor, a discrete population of highly metastatic OCT4+ SOX2+ cells. We
show that these metastatic cells have significantly elevated levels of intracellular copper and
exhibit increased sensitivity to copper deficiency. We have also shown that copper depletion
alters the architecture of extracellular matrix in the metastatic lungs of both mouse and human.
Our central hypothesis is that copper contributes to two key aspects of metastasis: cancer cell
intrinsic metabolic pathways that directly contribute to metastasis; and the “pre-metastatic niche”
that supports colonization, and outgrowth of disseminated metastatic tumor cells. To test this
hypothesis, we will use pre-clinical models to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms of
oral copper chelator tetrathiomolybdate (TM) and leverage banked samples from our completed
phase II TM clinical trial to develop collagen remodeling products as biomarkers of TM response.
The central goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanistic basis of copper depletion as a
viable treatment approach against TNBC metastasis. We expect to make significant advances
through the following aims. Aim 1 will establish the direct link between copper-mediated
metabolic reprograming and metastasis in TNBC and dissect key cellular and molecular
mechanisms, and Aim 2 will investigate how copper deficiency reprograms the extracellular
matrix in the distal metastatic organs to generate an inhospitable microenvironment to impair
metastasis and develop clinically valuable biomarkers of response to TM. Fundamental
discoveries from these integrated pharmacological and genetic investigations has the potential not
only to advance TM into larger randomized trials, but to identify new copper pathways for the
development of novel therapeutic strategies against TNBC."

Our goal is to develop an optical cochlear implant (oCI) that uses photons to stimulate surviving auditory
neurons in severely-to-profoundly deaf. The benefit of optical stimulation is its spatial selectivity with the
potential to create significantly more independent channels to encode acoustic information and to enhance the
CI users’ performance in challenging listening environments and to improve music appreciation. In previous
experiments we have defined the parameter space for infrared neural stimulation (INS) in diverse animal
models, including the cat. To translate the method into a clinical tool, an opto-electrical cochlear implant, we
have to convert the parameter space defined for the cats to the larger cochlea of the humans. In preparation of
the study we have communicated with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have submitted a Q-
submission for a study risk assessment for the first set of the proposed tests. The purpose of this study is to
show that optical and combined opto-electrical stimulation is possible in humans using optical fibers, optical
fiber bundles, and a hybrid opto-electrical cochlear implant. Furthermore, the tests will also validate that INS is
possible at radiation wavelengths, which are used commercially in communication and for which the
technology of optical sources and waveguides is well miniaturized and matured. Most importantly, we will use a
forward masking method to validate the view that optical stimulation is spatially more selective than electrical
stimulation by comparing the ability of a masking stimulus to reduce the response amplitude of a probe
stimulus. Test subjects will be patients with large tumors of the skull base, who require a translabyrinthine
craniotomy for tumor removal. For this surgical approach the cochlea and vestibular system will be damaged
and the patients will be deaf after surgery. This surgery provides an unique opportunity to test optical
stimulation in the human cochlea before it is removed during the tumor resection. Important data can be
gathered, which will drive the development of an implantable opto-electrical cochlear implant system by our
industrial collaborators. The measurements will take no longer than 30 minutes per patient, after which all the
equipment will be removed from the surgical filed and the tumor resection surgery continues."
10841497,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PTH and FGF23 initiate signaling pathways in renal proximal tubule cells that converge
on the [NPT2A:NHERF1] complex to inhibit phosphate uptake. Mice lacking the PDZ protein NHERF1 and
humans harboring NHERF1 mutations are hypophosphatemic. Important gaps exist in understanding the
elements involved in these actions due to unidentified factors. Numerous GWAS studies of patients with chronic
kidney disease implicate RGS14, which harbors a PDZ-recognition motif. We propose that RGS14 is a novel
regulator of hormone-sensitive phosphate transport, and provide preliminary data to support this idea. RGS14
is scaffold that integrates G protein, MAPK, and Ca++/CaM signaling pathways. Its actions are best understood
in rodent brain, where RGS14 suppresses synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-based learning. Nothing is known
about RGS14 effects on hormone action or in kidney. Our preliminary findings show that RGS14 suppresses
both PTH- and FGF23-regulated phosphate transport. RGS14 persistently attenuates PTH-regulated phosphate
transport in primary human proximal tubule cells. RGS14 knock-down by siRNA reverses this action to reveal
full PTH activity. RGS14 add-back to cells lacking the protein blocks PTH actions. Human RGS14 contains a C-
terminal PDZ ligand (-DSAL) that directly binds NHERF1. Mutations in the PDZ-ligand disrupt RGS14 binding
to NHERF1 and interfere with RGS14 regulation of hormone actions. These findings identify RGS14 as an
entirely new element regulating hormone action on a vital homeostatic activity, and raise the hypothesis that
RGS14 is a novel regulator of hormone-sensitive [NPT2A:NHERF1]-mediated phosphate transport in renal proximal
tubule cells. Three Aims will test this premise. AIM 1 will define how RGS14 regulates assembly, disassembly of
[NPT2A:NHERF1], its internalization and hormone-sensitive phosphate uptake. AIM 2 will define the locus of
RGS14 effects on PTH and FGF23 signaling and the impact of hormone-directed NHERF1 phosphorylation on
RGS14 regulation of the [NPT2A:NHERF1] complex. AIM 3: will define how PTH- and FGF23-directed signaling
affect RGS14 interactions with NHERF1 and the [NHERF1:NPT2A] complex. These studies will identify novel
roles and molecular mechanisms by which RGS14 regulates NPT2A function and hormone-sensitive phosphate
transport in kidney as related to kidney disease."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death in the United States. National guidelines recommend
that average risk people receive regular CRC screenings. Community health centers, such as federally qualified
health centers (FQHCs), provide high quality affordable healthcare to underserved populations across the nation.
Among patients treated at FQHCs, only 44% have completed a CRC screening within the recommended
timeframe (e.g., one colonoscopy per ten years). Patient navigation has proven effective for improving CRC
screening completion rates and screening quality. The effects of patient navigation are robust across
socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic group. Furthermore, extensive research has proven its efficacy in FQHC
settings. Although efficacious, patient navigation requires staffing and economic resources limiting its ability to
be widely disseminated, particularly in low-resourced settings like FQHCs. The proposed study aims to refine
and test a digital health solution, called the eNav Toolkit, designed to improve CRC screening uptake among
patients treated at FQHCs. The eNav Toolkit will be a web app that will assist with CRC screening decision
making, appointment reminders, preparation instructions/reminders, education, motivational interviewing
support, and linkage to follow up care. In order to maximize reach, the eNav Toolkit will be accessible on any
smartphone, tablet, or computer devise. For Aim 1, the eNav Toolkit 1.0 will be field tested on 10 participants.
Participants will be FQHC patients eligible for CRC screening. The field test results be applied to refine the eNav
content and improve the user-experience. The second iteration of the intervention, eNav Toolkit 2.0, will then be
field tested on a new set of 10 participants. The results from the second field test will be applied to refine and
finalize the eNav Toolkit. Aim 2 will conduct a multi-site randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of the
eNav Toolkit for improving CRC screening uptake among patients treated at FQHCs. Patients (N=400) will be
randomly assigned to one of two conditions: eNav Toolkit group (N=200) or usual care group (N=200).
Participants in the eNav Toolkit group will engage with the eNav Toolkit to assist in preparing for and completing
the CRC screening. Participants in the usual care group will receive usual care. Primary outcomes (CRC
screening completion) and secondary outcomes (CRC screening quality, follow up adherence) will be evaluated
at six months after study enrollment. Aim 3 will evaluate theoretical mechanisms of change (e.g., perceived
benefits, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility, self-efficacy), guided by the health belief model. If proven
efficacious, the eNav Toolkit will be integrated in the electronic health record (EHR) and disseminated across
FQHCs nationwide, with the ultimate goal of decreasing the burden of CRC among patients treated at FQHCs."
10871806,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) does not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR)
and Her2 as therapeutic targets and consequently has the worst prognosis among all types of breast cancers.
Metabolic reprogramming toward aerobic glycolysis (also called the Warburg effect) is a hallmark of cancer,
which is further activated in TNBC. Although aerobic glycolysis may be therapeutically targeted, the druggable
pathway has not been identified. p38 is a TNBC oncogene and stimulates glucose uptake and metabolic
adaption. This proposal will test the hypothesis that p38 promotes TNBC oncogenesis by stimulating
PFKFB3/GLUT1-dependent aerobic glycolysis.
 This hypothesis is based on the following findings: 1) p38 stimulates glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)
expression and increases glucose uptake; 2) p38 promotes TNBC oncogenesis; 3) TNBCs are highly
glycolytic with elevated PFKFB3 and GLUT1 expression; 4) p38 binds PFKFB3, a key glycolytic activator, in
TNBC cells, whereas it interacts with much less glycolytic three family members (PFKFB1, 2 and 4) in non-
TNBC cells; 5) MS/MS analysis identifies that p38 phosphorylates PFKFB3 at S467 leading to its stabilization,
whereas data from public data-base shows that p38 gene expression is correlated with GLUT1 in invasive
breast cancer tissues; 6) conditional p38 knockout (KO) inhibits tumorigenesis in a TNBC-like PyMT mouse
genetic breast cancer model and decreases PFKFB3/GLUT1 expression; 7) p38 overexpression in TNBC
cells increases PFKFB3/GLUT1 abundance, promotes their interaction, and stimulates ECAR (an indicator of
glycolysis), indicating its activity of stimulating aerobic glycolysis by forming a ternary complex; and 8)
pharmacological p38 and PFKFB3 inhibitors cooperatively decrease p-PFKFB3/PFKFB3/GLUT1 levels and
inhibit TNBC growth in a manner dependent on p38. These results together indicate that p38 links
aerobic glycolysis and TNBC oncogenesis through activating PFKFB3 and GLUT1.
 We will test this hypothesis by targeting the following aims: AIM 1 will investigate if p38 links aerobic
glycolysis and TNBC oncogenesis through interaction with PFKFB3 and stimulating of PFKFB3
phosphorylation at S467; AIM 2 will determine if p38 cooperates with both PFKFB3 and GLUT1 to promote
aerobic glycolysis and TNBC oncogenesis by stimulating a S467-dependent ternary-complex; and AIM 3 will
determine if the p38-PFKFB3 kinase cascade is a therapeutic target for TNBC and if the p38/PFKFB3/Glut1
co-upregulation with elevated p-PFKFB3 identifies a subgroup of TNBC with a worse prognosis in clinic. These
studies will demonstrate if the p38-PFKFB3 kinase cascade is a novel therapeutic target for TNBC and reveal
if a combined application of p38/PFKFB3 pharmacological inhibitors is a potential effective therapeutic
strategy that will impact TNBC clinical outcome and veteran health care."
10881661,"Breast cancer is the most frequently occurring cancer in women. Military women are at increased risk of
breast cancer. The mortality and morbidity from breast cancer is due to its metastatic spread. The role of
AMPK in tumorigenesis is controversial. Although AMPK inhibition was implicated in promoting
tumorigenesis, we showed, several years ago, that AMPK activation is required for tumor cells survival
during solid tumor formation. In recent years this assertion was independently corroborated by others in
various types of cancer. In this grant application we propose that AMPK and its downstream effector the
fatty acid translocase, CD36, are required for breast cancer metastasis. It is known that high ROS levels
in disseminating cells is an impediment for metastasis and therefore the metabolic rewiring of key
signaling pathways is critical to confer enhanced antioxidant metabolism to overcome this hurdle.
Combating high ROS levels during metastatic colonization requires increased glucose uptake and
utilization. We propose that the excess of ROS levels in disseminating breast cancer cells is a
consequence of impaired glucose uptake and utilization. This impairment inhibits the oxidative pentose
phosphate pathway (oxPPP) that generates NADPH to combat ROS. The limited glucose utilization
during dissemination also leads to the activation of AMPK. By inhibiting fatty acid synthesis (FAS) and by
elevating fatty acid oxidation (FAO), AMPK could maintain intracellular NADPH levels to combat ROS
even when glucose utilization is impaired. In the first part of this grant application we will delineate the
mechanism by which AMPK activation is required for breast cancer metastasis. In the second part of the
grant application we will determine if the fatty acid translocase, CD36, is required for tumorigenesis and
metastasis mediated by AMPK activation, and whether CD36 could be systemically targeted to inhibit
breast cancer metastasis. We will use human breast cancer cell lines and PDOs and orthotopic
transplantation as well as a mouse models for breast cancer metastasis in these studies. The proposed
studies have a translational impact as they will determine whether drug therapy that activates AMPK
directly or indirectly could have worse outcomes with respect to breast cancer metastasis, and whether
targeting CD36 could inhibit breast cancer metastasis particularly in obese patients."
10846744,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The central oxygen sensor that controls red cell mass is PHD2 (also known as EGLN1). In
specialized interstitial cells of the renal cortex, PHD2 prolyl hydroxylates the transcription factor HIF-2a in
an oxygen-dependent manner and targets it for degradation. Under hypoxic conditions, prolyl hydroxylation
is arrested, leading to the stabilization of HIF-2a and the activation of the ERYTHROPOIETIN gene, leading
to expansion of red cell mass. We are still at an early stage of understanding how PHD2 works. PHD2 has
two domains, a catalytic domain and a zinc finger domain. The former catalyzes prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-
2a. The function of the latter has been elusive. A critical role for the latter is evidenced by patients with
erythrocytosis who harbor loss of function mutations in the zinc finger of PHD2, and by mice with
inactivating mutations of the zinc finger that display erythrocytosis. Previous in vitro studies have shown the
zinc finger binds to a Pro-Xaa-Leu-Glu (PXLE) motif that is found in components of the HSP90 pathway,
including p23, FKBP38, HSP90a, and HSP90a, as well as in the ribosomal chaperone NACA. The HIF
pathway is present in all metazoans, and this PXLE motif shows strong conservation in these proteins
across metazoan species. This leads to a model in which this motif recruits PHD2 to the translation and
HSP90 pathways to facilitate hydroxylation of HIF-2a, which is a known client of the protein folding HSP90
pathway. In this manner, PHD2 can maintain tight control over HIF-2a levels.
 The aforementioned observations on erythrocytosis identify a critical role for the zinc finger.
However, they do not identify which of these PXLE-containing proteins, if any, are essential for normal
regulation of red cell mass by PHD2. To address this, we have recently generated mice with knockin
missense mutations that ablate the Pro-Xaa-Leu-Glu motif in the p23, Fkbp38, Hsp90a, Hsp90b, and Naca
genes to prevent the interaction of the respective proteins with PHD2. We will examine the individual
knockin mice as well as combinations of knockins for hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, red blood cell
count, and serum Epo levels. We will determine the tissue source of Epo mRNA. We will also cross these
mice with a Tibetan Phd2 knockin mouse that bears a double amino acid substitution in its zinc finger that
selectively impairs interaction with p23 in order to independently assess the importance of these
interactions. The proposed studies will identify a mechanism by which patients with PHD2 zinc finger
mutations develop erythrocytosis. Importantly, these studies will also resolve the apparent paradox of how
high altitude-adapted Tibetans can harbor mutations that impair PHD2 zinc finger function and at the same
time avoid erythrocytosis. The studies will reveal unanticipated links between oxygen sensing and the
translation and HSP90 pathways in the control of red cell mass."

The advent of genome editing and induced pluripotent stem cell technologies now provide hope for creating

regulatory mechanisms that guide cell differentiation and function stands as a significant barrier to progress.
Overcoming this barrier will require a workforce with a training foundation that integrates a strong base in
genetics, a deep knowledge of developmental, cellular and molecular mechanisms, and the ability to apply
basic concepts to the translational potential of stem cell biology. The Genetics of Development, Disease, and
Regeneration Training Program seeks to foster a broad foundation of interdisciplinary knowledge and career
development that empowers a diverse population of students to apply their training to the study and treatment
of developmental diseases. To achieve this goal, the GDDR Program is grounded in five training fundamentals:
1) knowledge base, 2) research skills and innovative technology, 3) hypothesis-driven research, 4)
communication skills and 5) professional and career development. The GDDR Program will create a unique
training environment by combining the broad and interdisciplinary research interests of our faculty with a
training plan that integrates genetic principles and mechanisms into the study of development and stem cell
biology. Thirty well-funded and accomplished Training Faculty drawn from 10 basic science and clinical
departments create a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary environment. The breadth of our training
environment will provide trainees with a diverse menu of labs for thesis training, while maintaining a supportive
community and facilitating beneficial interactions between the GDDR Program and other T32-funded programs
at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. We will take full advantage of these interactions to
develop courses and training activities that involve multiple programs. Thus we will broaden the exposure of
our trainees to different knowledge, technologies, and career opportunities, and extend the impact of our
training program to benefit a larger population of students and researchers at CU AMC. Based on the quality
and size of our student pool and Training Faculty, we propose to support six trainees per year, which will
permit us to be highly selective while building an interactive group of trainees. Our trainee recruitment plans
are structured to attract highly talented students from diverse backgrounds, thereby contributing to a rich
setting for training and accomplishment."

I have been studying neurodegenerative disease for more than 30 years. While a graduate student, I identified
the cause of X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) as the expansion of a CAG repeat in the
androgen receptor (AR) gene. As the first disorder shown to be caused by a CAG – polyglutamine
(polyQ) repeat tract, this discovery led to the emergence of a new field. My research program began with
emphasis on 2 polyQ disorders: SBMA and spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7). My early work established
transcription dysregulation as a key factor in polyQ disease pathogenesis. I initiated research on Huntington’s
disease (HD), and linked mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic deficits in HD to transcription dysregulation
of PGC-1a, a transcription co-activator. In 2016, I documented an interaction between PPARd and huntingtin
(htt) protein in striatal-like neurons and in the cerebral cortex of HD mice, and I demonstrated that PPARd
repression contributes to HD neurotoxicity. These findings led me to repurpose a selective and potent PPARd
agonist, KD3010, as capable of rescuing htt neurotoxicity in HD transgenic mice and in medium spiny neurons
from HD patient stem cells. Concomitant with my HD research, I uncovered a central role for skeletal muscle
in SBMA by demonstrating that excision of mutant AR transgene from skeletal muscle in BAC conditional
transgenic mice prevented the development of neuromuscular SBMA phenotypes, establishing the importance
of skeletal muscle – motor neuron (MN) communication at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) for SBMA lower
MN disease. I have thus continuously maintained NINDS R01 funding to support my SBMA research since
2000, and have held NINDS R01 funding to support my HD research since 2010. During this time frame, my
research has increasingly focused on identification of targets and pathways for development of therapies. As a
R35 recipient, I will continue my research on the cellular and molecular basis of polyQ neurodegeneration,
embracing opportunities to extend our findings to more common neurodegenerative diseases, including AD,
PD, and ALS. One major focus will be to define the basis of SBMA muscle-driven MN disease through skeletal
muscle and NMJ transcriptome analysis of SBMA model mice and stem cell modeling to recapitulate non-cell
autonomous SBMA MN degeneration. I also intend to pursue studies of HD and PPARd by determining the
normal function of PPARd in CNS and defining how PPARd activation achieves neuroprotection. I will follow
up on exciting findings linking PPARd neuroprotection to regulation of neuronal activity-dependent gene
expression, and will test if blunting of rapid primary response gene expression can ameliorate HD phenotypes.
As PPARd is highly expressed in microglia and represses neuroinflammation, I will study PPARd function in
microglia and test if PPARd dysregulation plays a role in neurodegenerative disease. R35 funding would
provide me with the flexibility to pursue novel, ambitious studies of polyQ disease, expand my research
program to encompass emerging areas of pathogenesis, and maintain a lasting commitment to translational
research and therapy development for neurodegeneration."

 This proposal outlines a request to fund our multidisciplinary predoctoral training program, Stanford’s
Translational Biomedical Imaging Instrumentation (TBI2) training program. Biomedical imaging technology
continues to evolve at a rapid pace. Our mission is to train the next generation of researchers and inventors in
translational biomedical imaging instrumentation in order to meet the national demand for highly skilled scientists
in this field. At the national level, there persists a clear need for trained researchers in biomedical imaging
instrumentation to fill positions in academia, industry, and government in order to fuel the cycles of innovation
that ultimately impact human health. Our vision for achieving translational impact includes both bench to
bedside (clinical translation) and bench to industry (translational entrepreneurship). Our vision is motivated
by the career interests of our trainees, many of whom seek professional opportunities in academics and many
of whom seek to translate their skills for translational impact by way of industry.
 Stanford University provides a highly innovative and unique multidisciplinary research environment in
biomedical imaging instrumentation. The TBI2 faculty have an outstanding track record of innovation and
translation that spans magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy, computed tomography, ultrasound, PET,
molecular imaging, and optical imaging. Training in these modalities, plus exposure to hybrid imaging systems
(X-ray/MR, PET/MR, and MR-guided focused ultrasound), will provide trainees with broad experience using
advanced biomedical imaging technologies. Mentoring by our well-established research mentors and clinical co-
mentors will provide opportunities to push developments towards translational applications in our adult and
pediatric hospital settings.
 Parallel opportunites will provide experience in translational entrepreneurship to accelerate the entry of new
technologies into industry for worldwide impact. Didactic training opportunities in the physics of medical imaging
systems, image and signal processing, radiologic anatomy and physiology, advanced diagnostics, interventional
procedures, and radiation therapy provide a rich learning environment. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and
machine learning have been key technologies driving imaging innovation at Stanford for many years, and training
in artificial intelligence and machine learning form a substantial emphasis of this new training program. It is
woven across imaging modalities and includes both upstream and downstream applications.
 Trainees will also gain expertise in rigorous and reproducible experimental design, plus the ethical
considerations of their research. TBI2 trainees that complete our training program will have a unique skill set that
fullfills a distinct national need for researchers and leaders with expertise in advanced biomedical imaging
instrumentation."
10817218,"This application requests continuation of funding for a successful and long-standing training program
(dating back to 1991). This program was rebranded 5 years ago as the Iowa Neuroscience Specialty Program
In Research Education (INSPIRE) to integrate training in Translational Neuroscience relevant to psychiatry
with an emphasis on a lifespan trajectory perspective. Research opportunities are unified through a focus on
the critical framework for Translational Neuroscience, the NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) project
which focuses on mechanisms of psychopathology within functional dimensions rather than diagnostic criteria.
INSPIRE is now training young investigators who have a high level of sophistication in thinking about and
interrogating the complexities of the human brain’s functional domains, the change of these systems over time,
and how discovery of mechanisms of pathologic functioning are translated to clinical diagnosis and treatment.
 The Co-PIs are Peg Nopoulos, an alumnus of this T32 program herself and a national leader in research
training and neuroimaging, and John Wemmie, a translational psychiatry investigator with long-term federal
research funding across multiple domains. The Co-PIs have retained the solid foundation of this program put in
place by Nancy Andreasen, a pioneer in neuroimaging and psychosis. The reframed program started 5 years
ago has two core areas: 1) a highly structured curriculum emphasizing Translational Neuroscience, and 2) a
focus on the study of neurobiologic mechanisms of psychiatric illness across the lifespan.
 The content of the program expanded into multiple areas of Translational Neuroscience by partnering with
the Molecular and Computational Psychiatry division and the Iowa Neuroscience Institute (INI). MD/PhD and
PhD mentors with strong training records are newly recruited to the program due to a focus on Translational
Neuroscience or through recent INI recruitment. Accordingly, the program has a diverse, interdisciplinary group
of trainees with basic science PhDs, MDs, and MD/PhDs all building a Translational Neuroscience identity.
Matching funds that support additional trainees help to form a cohesive cohort. This mix of types of trainees
adds an additional layer of exposure to translational research with a strong emphasis on team science.
 Central to the training is the Master’s in Translational Biomedicine (TBM) program through our Institute for
Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). This program is designed to be individualized and flexible. The
INSPIRE program recruits fellows to fill 4 positions each year for two years of postdoctoral training. Each
fellow is ‘matched’ with an outstanding mentor and mentor team to oversee the primary activity of mentored
research. A weekly seminar encompasses essential skills including presenting, writing, and networking with
faculty in Translational Neuroscience. In addition, each fellow develops a program through the TBM that suits
their needs while fulfilling requirements (such as Training in Responsible Conduct in Research), utilizing formal
didactics and career development activities. A degree (certificate or Master’s) is an option, but not required."

This T35 grant application from the Vanderbilt Student Research and Training Program (SRTP) requests
continued support for medical student research training in the areas of diabetes, obesity, digestive diseases,
and kidney diseases. The SRTP started in 1975, and NIH-funded since 1980, has provided research training
for over 1200 students from 130 medical schools. This includes students from 45 states including Hawaii and
Puerto Rico, and nearly 1/3 have been from groups underrepresented in science. Each year the SRTP
supports 32 medical students to visit Vanderbilt and conduct research with some of the top experts in diabetes,
digestive, and kidney diseases (20 students in diabetes research groups, 6 in GI, and 6 in kidney). The SRTP
also provides leadership and infrastructure support for the national NIDDK Medical Student Research Program
that trains an additional 90 students at 16 Diabetes Research Centers around the country.
The goal of the SRTP is to train physician-scientists and provide exposure to mentors that inspire this career
trajectory. A major focus of the SRTP is outreach to those that might not otherwise have opportunities to
engage in experiences that would help them develop a physician-scientist career. We additionally provide
exposure to key clinical topics in diabetes, GI, and kidney diseases in order to guide the students’ clinical and
research careers toward a focus on these important diseases. The SRTP is affiliated with three Vanderbilt
research centers: a NIDDK- supported center grant in diabetes (P30), a NIDDK-supported center grant in
digestive disease (P30), and a NIDDK-supported center grant in kidney disease (P30). These three centers
provide the SRTP research base and preceptors for the student’s research experience.
The SRTP has three main components: 1) A two-to-three-month intensive mentored research experience
designed to “light the fire” for discovery; 2) A twice-weekly enrichment program focused on educating about the
diverse career pathways of physician-scientists and key clinical and research topics in diabetes, GI, and kidney
disease; 3) A national research symposium: This is held at the end of the summer jointly with students from the
NIDDK medical student research program. The students present their work, hear keynote talks from visiting
professors about career development, have meals and network with faculty and near-peer mentors, and learn
about the next steps with regard to research options in residency and fellowship.
We propose aims and innovations that will help SRTP adapt to a rapidly changing world of research, clinical
care, and medical education. These aims center around: 1) building better flexibility with changing medical
school curricula, 2) vertical integration with other physician-scientist training programs and near-peer
mentoring, 3) promoting diversity for the SRTP, and 4) continuing to develop robust post-program support to
guide career paths. With continued support from the NIH/NIDDK, we propose a comprehensive and exciting
experience early in students’ medical careers that will help them make career-defining decisions."

The broad mission of the predoctoral Chemistry/Biology Interface Training Program (CBITP) is to educate,
train, and develop early-career scientists of diverse backgrounds to be thought leaders, role models and
innovators at the Chemistry/Biology Interface for the greater benefit of humanity. The overall objective of the
program is to train scientists who will make strong contributions to the chemical biological sciences leading to a
sustained impact, ultimately benefitting society. During their supported training period in years 2 (5 students)
and 3 (5 students) of the overall CBITP, students will: 1) Develop broad background knowledge of modern
chemical biology research; 2) Develop strong background knowledge of detailed methods used in the chemical
biology field; 3) Demonstrate advanced knowledge in specialized areas of chemical biology, including critical
evaluation of molecular structure, function, (bio)synthesis, reactivity, and application in basic cellular/
organismal physiology; 4) Design, perform and communicate original, high-quality, rigorous (robust controls
and statistical analysis), and ethically-conducted research upon critically examining previous scientific
knowledge in chemical biology; 5) Express self-efficacy and professionalism to navigate the biomedical
science career landscape; and 6) Develop professional oral and written communication skills. As large pharma
internal Research & Development (R&D) efforts have decreased, job opportunities within the growing
biotech/biopharma sector have increased. The founding of new biopharma ventures, by definition, involves a
combination of chemistry and biology. The rationale for the training of students at this interface will not only
help supply the workforce in the biotech/biopharma sector but will also produce the next generation of faculty
and entrepreneurs to promote science and technology innovations and maintain U.S. leadership in these areas
on the world stage. The program takes advantage of the very deep and diverse chemical, biological, and
biomedical sciences applicant pool at Yale University as well as the extraordinary research strengths of the
associated faculty. We have established a rigorous CBITP core curriculum with new and intensive half credit
modules, which allows the students more flexibility in matching instruction and coursework with their
educational and research needs. We have also established an assortment of CBITP-specific hands-on
research (e.g., high-throughput screening, genomics, proteomics, etc) and career (e.g., internships with
biopharma, alternative careers in bioscience, etc) workshops in addition to chemical biology symposia and
conferences to promote overall student and program successes. To evaluate the efficacy, training outcomes,
and career outcomes emerging from our existing and new programmatic activities, in addition to exploring the
experiences of our trainees, we will employ a data-driven mixed-methods approach for continuous refinement.
Collectively, we propose to modernize our successful 20-year CBITP for this new, next generation CBITP."

Suicide is a significant public health problem among youth. Data indicate suicidal behaviors were increasing
among youth even before the COVID-19 pandemic began and have likely increased even more since its onset.
This R16 proposed research seeks to address the urgent mental health crisis and respond to the recent
advisories from the US Surgeon General that highlight the need for a better understanding of the impact of the
pandemic on youth. We will meet this objective by pursuing the following specific aims: (1) Identifying the
trajectory of suicide risk among youth across the pandemic period and testing if there have been differential
changes based on demographics; (2) Determining how social determinants of health are related to suicide risk
among youth; and (3) Characterizing the moderating and mediating roles of social determinants of health in the
association between COVID-19 burden and suicide risk among youth. This research is innovative in several
ways. First, it will apply a Social Determinants of Health framework and thus will widen the investigation of
suicidal behavior risk factors beyond individual-level factors to include relevant social, economic, education,
physical infrastructure, and healthcare risk factors, which have often been overlooked in COVID-19 mental
health research with youth. Second, it will use real-time crisis response data to determine how suicide risk has
changed over the course of the pandemic, an important asset given the reporting time lag involved with other
data sources. Third, it will link data from large national databases (SDOH, Crisis Text Line, USAFacts) that
each provides important and unique strengths (e.g., national, real-time, explores sexual orientation and race
identity) to assess the direct, indirect, and interactive effects of social determinants of health and COVID-19
burden on suicidal behavior among youth. Our research team is particularly poised to undertake this
investigation. The PI has extensive experience in suicide research, secondary data analysis, and mentoring
students, and the Co-Investigators have experience using several of the proposed data sources and similar
data analytic approaches as proposed. Further, Appalachian State University is an ideal institution to receive
this award because Pell grants support 28% of its undergraduate students, it awards degrees in biomedical
sciences, and has received only one NIH grant in the past two years."

The Summer Undergraduate Research in Environmental Health Sciences (SURES) program at the University of
Kentucky is designed to introduce students to the highly interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of
environmental health science (EHS) research that is focused on solving key global health problems. An
additional focus is to prepare underprivileged and under-represented students for successful careers in relevant
fields. This is a competitive renewal application seeks support to continue our 10-week summer program and
support fellowships for 10 students. The SURES program leverages the substantial and ongoing efforts at the
University of Kentucky driven to enhance the undergraduate research experience with the robust environmental
health science research programs of involved faculty mentors. The specific aims are to 1) enhance student
understanding and interest in EHS and 2) improve student scientific and career skills. Towards this end, students
will be recruited from the Commonwealth of Kentucky with an emphasis on those from the Appalachian region
as well as from a variety of undergraduate institutions in order to create a cohort of participants representing
diverse populations. The SURES program will commence with a week-long session that introduces students to
research, laboratory safety and scientific ethics. The students will then experience hands-on research by
performing experiments in the laboratories of their chosen mentors. Professional development and a sense of
belonging to the EHS community will be built via student participation in weekly lunches with EHS researchers
and professionals, net-working opportunities and tours of research facilities. In addition, students will be paired
with a near-peer mentor and engage in weekly activities that include a “citizen science” lead collection group
exercise, a theatre improvisation workshop, community-building circle on mentoring, “painting their projects” and
viewing a discussing a film on climate change. Each participant will create an EHS-relevant podcast. The
SURES program will culminate in a campus-wide poster session attended by the faculty, staff, students and
student family members. Success of the program is indicated by the engagement of prior participants in careers
in university research (13%), industry (16%), government/nonprofits (11%) and pursuing graduate (16%)
/professional (37%) education. Dissemination of the approaches used in this program and their outcomes will
build upon the expansion of the traditional environmental health sciences research training from the graduate
and post-doctoral level to the undergraduates at a national level."
10783727,"Poxviruses are a large family of DNA viruses with several members capable of infecting and causing disease in humans. Whereas the most notorious member, variola virus, is the causative agent of smallpox and was eradicated from natural infection, there are still concerns about a clandestine release during a biological attack. In addition, other members of the family, such as monkeypox virus, have raised concern about epizootic infections that are capable of causing epidemics. For these reasons several poxviruses are listed as Category A priority pathogens by NIH/NIAID. Poxviruses produce two infectious forms, intracellular mature virus (IMV) and extracellular virus (EV). EV are formed by the intracellular envelopment of IMV and are critical for cell-to-cell spread, systemic infection, and pathogenesis. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular mechanisms employed by orthopoxviruses to envelope, transport, and release infectious EV. Only 9 viral proteins are known to be unique to the EV form. Whereas some functions have be assigned to these 9 proteins, none of them have been shown to be a matrix- like protein and make a direct connection with the IMV form of the virus to coordinate envelopment. The immediate goal of this application is to better define the role of the putative matrix protein F13 in intracellular envelopment of EV and its relationship with the other EV glycoproteins. We propose 3 aims to better understand the function of F13: 1) Interrogate interactions between F13 and IMV surface proteins. We hypothesize that F13 acts as a matrix protein and provides a link between the outer EV membrane and the inner IMV particle and facilitates interactions with IMV at the site of intracellular envelopment, the TGN. In this aim we will further characterize interactions between F13 and IMV surface proteins. 2) Uncover cellular and viral proteins that interact with the putative matrix protein F13. We will use BioID to identify viral and cellular proteins that interact with F13 during specific stages of envelopment. 3). Determine the relationship between F13, glycoprotein content, EV cell binding, and non fusogenic dissolution for virus entry. We will utilize a panel of recombinant viruses to determine how F13 controls glycoprotein content and how this effects cell binding and entry of EV. The results obtained from these studies will provide greater insight into the molecular mechanism poxviruses use to produce infectious EV, spread cell-to-cell, and cause disease in their hosts. This information will in turn inform intelligent decisions in designing recombinant poxvirus vectors for both vaccines and oncolytic platforms."
10646428,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overarching goal of this project is to use a novel virtual reality (VR) physical and cognitive
intervention aimed at improving brain health and cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is the most common cause of cognitive impairment in
older adults and affects 36 million people worldwide. Results from several large pharmacological trials have been
sobering with no effective treatments for halting, slowing, or preventing the disease. Exercise has emerged as
an exciting, lifestyle intervention to help mitigate cognitive loss or delay the onset of dementia. However, to fully
leverage exercise benefits in this at-risk population, training the brain to learn and engage in a cognitively-
stimulating and physically-demanding environment may be key to effective therapies. Controlled cognitively-
challenging environments created in a VR setting provide an adaptable and safe environment for improving
cognitive dysfunction in older adults at risk for AD. While a large body of literature has found that exercise
enhances cognition, very few studies have coupled physical and cognitive activity in a VR environment,
simultaneously. By engaging and challenging spatial memory during moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise
over time, memories for newly acquired information may be stronger and longer-lasting than either physical or
cognitive activity alone.
 Therefore, in this project, we aim to use an integrated, ecologically valid, and meaningful physical and
cognitive intervention in VR that targets the hippocampus, a key region of interest in older adults at risk for AD.
We will recruit and randomize 150 older adults to participate in the intervention (combined physical and cognitive
VR program), active control (physical cycling only), or passive control (cognitive VR only) group to investigate
changes in cognition, brain function, blood-based biomarkers, and physical health in old adults (55-80 years old)
with early mild cognitive impairment. Results from this study will provide new evidence for the benefits of a novel
combined VR intervention that target physical and cognitive health, simultaneously."
10764280,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG repeat expansion in
the gene huntingtin (HTT). The CAG repeat is translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in the mutant HTT
protein that has neurotoxic properties. Current therapeutic efforts are focused at suppressing the expression of
the mutant HTT protein or targeting downstream pathways of neurotoxicity. We and others have shown that CAG
repeat-targeting phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) and neurotrophic protein BDNF have
therapeutic benefits for HD. However, PMOs and BDNF do not usually cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB),
hindering the translation of clinical application. Therefore, more efficient delivery vehicles capable of BBB
penetration are critical for the development of effective therapies for HD and other neurodegenerative disorders
in general. Exosomes (Exo) are cell-secreted extracellular vehicles with BBB penetration potential, capable of
delivering exogeneous therapeutic molecules. iPSCs have been considered as one of the best sources for Exo
manufacture, based on high Exo yield, availability of cGMP-compatible clinical-grade manufacture platform for
iPSC production and Exo manufacture, and feasibility to perform genome editing to establish engineered iPSCs
that produce modified Exo for more efficient brain targeting. We therefore propose to develop strategies to
produce brain-targeting Exo from engineered iPSCs as delivery vehicles for PMOs as well as BDNF, and further
rigorously study the therapeutic efficacy of the brain-targeting Exo loaded with PMOs and BDNF in a panel of
HD neuron and mouse models. Success of this project will set the stage for future larger scale investigations
aimed at using huma iPSC-derived Exo for targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules (such as PMOs, chemical
compounds and neurotrophic factors) for various neurodegenerative disorders."
10852817,"This proposal is to study the role of toxic Nascent Polypeptide Chain (NPC) misfolding and aggregation in
stroke brain injury. Stroke is a devastating neurological disease, affecting millions of Veterans. Therapies to
reestablish perfusion are the current gold standard for treating acute stroke. However, because of the potential
hemorrhagic side effect, only about 5% of stroke patients receive reperfusion therapy.
 Translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein is also known as NPC synthesis. Our laboratory
originally discovered that massive NPC aggregation occurs in post-ischemic neurons destined for death. We
have published 30 papers on this subject. These studies have shown that NPC synthesis is inhibited in two
distinct phases. The first phase of inhibition is transient, abating entirely after 0.5-1 h of reperfusion in all post-
ischemic neurons; thus, not correlating with future neuronal death after brain ischemia. This first phase of
inhibition is followed by a recovery of >70% of NPC synthesis at 4 h of reperfusion among all post-ischemic
neurons. The second phase of NPC synthesis inhibition takes place progressively from 4 h of reperfusion
onward and is only in neurons destined to die. Our studies have shown that this second phase of inhibition is
due to the post-ischemic loss of co-translational chaperone protection of NPCs. Without this protection, NPCs
expose their sticky hydrophobic segments during synthesis and are irreversibly aggregated on ribosomes from
4 h of reperfusion onward after brain ischemia.
 These studies have led to the novel discovery that targeting massive NPC aggregation by reducing the
load of “unprotected” NPCs on ribosomes with eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) inhibitors can protect brain from
stroke injury. By using high throughput technologies, several “direct” eIF4E (interaction) inhibitors have been
identified, e.g., a dual inhibitor against eIF4E-to-eIF4G and eIF4E-to-4E-BP1 interactions (4E1Rcat) and
ribavirin. These discoveries provide an outstanding opportunity to understand the role of NPC aggregation in
stroke brain injury and to develop a novel category of anti-stroke agents. Our laboratory has studied several eIF
inhibitors. Among them, 4EGI-1 offers the best anti-stroke efficacy in mouse stroke models. Therefore, we used
4EGI-1 in double-blind, randomized controlled animal studies. These studies clearly demonstrated that mice
treated with i.p. injection of 4EGI-1 after 30 min of reperfusion had no stroke mortality compared to the 45%
mortality in the vehicle group. 4EGI-1 treatment significantly reduced the infarct volume, improved physical
recovery and behavioral performance, and decreased neurological deficits after stroke.
 The goals of the proposed research are to investigate further the role of NPC aggregation in stroke brain
injury and to identify the best targets and inhibitors against stroke brain injury (Aim 1); and to investigate the
details of the underlying brain protection mechanisms (Aims 2 and 3). We will test the following hypotheses: (1)
Inhibition of eIF4E not only reduces the load of post-ischemic “unprotected” NPCs on ribosomes, but also
switches translation from a cap-dependent to a cap-independent state. This switch shuts down cap-dependent
NPC translation while prioritizing cap-independent translation of molecular chaperones; thus, protecting post-
ischemic “unprotected” NPCs from toxic aggregation during reperfusion. (2) 4EGI-1 treatment leads to a robust
upregulation of ATF4 and CHOP transcription factors to induce essential autophagic genes; thus, facilitating the
removal of toxic NPC aggregates after brain ischemia. (3) Inhibition of eIF4E mitigates post-stroke
inflammation. Although inhibition of other NPC synthesis initiation factors/regulators may also reduce the load of
“unprotected” NPCs on ribosomes, these other superior benefits (e.g., upregulation of co-translational molecular
chaperones and autophagic proteins) offered by eIF4E inhibition described above give eIF4E an edge as the
therapeutic target to reduce toxic NPC aggregation after brain ischemia. The eIF4E inhibitors show an excellent
potential to become a new class of anti-stroke drugs for Veterans."
10813122,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Excess adrenal steroid production is a prevalent but underdiagnosed etiology of hypertension and
cardiovascular disease and poorly managed with current medical therapies. Diverse lines of complementary
evidence point to dysfunction of adrenal mitochondrial redox pathways as an unexplored pathogenic driver for
these conditions. For example, although physiologic stimuli and genetic mutations that increase production of
the adrenal steroid aldosterone act through a shared pathway of elevated cytosolic Ca2+, Ca2+ elevations are
buffered by mitochondria. Adrenal mitochondria have a unique electron transport chain that uses the redox
cofactor NADPH to support several steps in steroidogenesis, and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can stimulate
production of the steroids aldosterone and cortisol in a manner correlating with increased mitochondrial
NADPH. Importantly, human loss of function mutations in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT)
produce a mitochondrial NADPH deficiency that, in turn, can cause severe cortisol and aldosterone deficiency.
While together this suggests a key role for mitochondrial redox biology in adrenal steroid physiology, to date
exploration has been limited in this area due to limited knowledge of the basic biology of adrenal mitochondria.
Preliminary data presented here highlight a novel purification methodology to produce the first proteomic
characterization of adrenal mitochondria, which show notable enrichment for the redox enzymes NNT and
NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase 1). Adrenal mitochondrial preparations are validated with
bioenergetic interrogation in a custom-built fluorimeter, and NNT and NQO1-deficient human adrenal cells are
generated with CRISPR. With these unique resources, studies are proposed to address the central hypothesis
that novel redox pathways of adrenal mitochondria regulate steroidogenesis. Mechanism will be elucidated
with bioenergetic studies of isolated mitochondria and permeabilized human adrenal cells, stable isotope
tracing of permeabilized cells, targeted LC-MS measurements of steroids and central redox
cofactors/metabolites, and activity-based metabolite profiling with recombinant enzymes on fresh adrenal
extracts. The studies will launch a new direction in the study of adrenal steroidogenesis. The applicant, Dr.
Patrick Ward, Instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital, has delineated a 5 year career plan building upon
his Ph.D. in cancer metabolism and his clinical training in internal medicine and endocrinology. Dr. Ward will
be mentored by Dr. Vamsi Mootha, a world leader in mitochondrial biology with an exceptional training record,
and advised by an outstanding committee with significant expertise in adrenal biology, hypertension, and
cardiovascular disease. Dr. Ward’s outstanding mentorship team and institutional environment, coupled with
the novel resources he has already generated, uniquely position him to execute his proposed studies and
subsequently transition to independence while rapidly ascending as a leader in adrenal metabolism."

Mental disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide, yet treatment gaps exceed 90% in many low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs). Significant progress is being made in access to mental healthcare through
task-shifting to lower-level healthcare providers. However, while task-sharing may increase access to care,
limited attention has been paid to assessing and optimizing quality of care across the mental health (MH) care
cascade. An urgent need exists for evidence-based strategies to optimize the MH care cascade globally.
 Implementation strategies focused on one step in a care cascade can contribute to unintended system
bottlenecks and quality of care issues. By contrast, the “Systems Analysis and Improvement Approach (SAIA)”
is a multicomponent implementation strategy focused on optimizing quality across an entire care cascade. SAIA
blends external/internal facilitation, enhanced local clinical consultation, and the creation of facility-level learning
collaboratives with systems-engineering tools in a 5-step approach developed for task-shared providers. The 5
steps of SAIA include: (1) cascade analysis to visualize treatment cascade drop-offs and prioritize areas for
system improvements; (2) process mapping to identify modifiable facility-level bottlenecks; (3) identification and
implementation of modifications to improve system performance; (4) assessment of modification effects on the
cascade; and (5) repeated analysis and improvement cycles. A previous trial established that the SAIA
implementation strategy improved maternal ARV initiation and early infant diagnosis for the prevention of mother-
to-child transmission HIV care cascade (R01HD075057; PI: Sherr).
 The SAIA implementation strategy has shown effectiveness for HIV cascade improvement, although no
evidence exists on the effectiveness of SAIA applied to other complex treatment cascades – such as outpatient
schizophrenia treatment. The present study aims to fill this knowledge gap by testing the following specific aims:
Primary Aim 1: test the effectiveness of the SAIA-MH implementation strategy for schizophrenia cascade
optimization using a cluster RCT and assess determinants of implementation success; Secondary Aim 1: test
causal pathway models to analyze mechanisms of action for effects of the SAIA-MH implementation strategy;
Aim 2: estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of scaling-up SAIA-MH in Mozambique.
 In response to PAR-19-274, this project tests a multicomponent implementation strategy affecting
“organizational structure, climate, culture, and processes”, with the goal to optimize the “implementation of
diagnostic interventions, effective treatments, and clinical procedures into existing care”. This project also
analyzes “mechanisms of action that explain the impact of a multi-component strategy to inform how these
strategies can optimally be delivered across various settings”. If effective, the SAIA-MH implementation strategy
has a large potential to be rapidly scaled-up to decrease gaps in task-shared MH treatments globally."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that currently lacks a fundamental
approach to treatment. To develop an effective therapeutic strategy, we need to understand the molecular
mechanism behind how ASD is established. It is known that infection during pregnancy increases the
probability of offspring developing ASD; therefore, we have been using a maternal immune activation (MIA)
model of ASD in mice. Using this model, we have found that the TLR3 ligand polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid
(Poly(I:C)) as well as virus can pass through the placenta and directly activate fetal border-associated
macrophages (BAMs) in the choroid plexus (CP) of the fetal brain. Furthermore, we have discovered that
TLR3-MIA increases the number of BAMs in the CP as well as increases their expression of S100a8 and
S100a9, which together forms a heterodimeric protein called calprotectin. Since increased calprotectin
expression is known to associate with chronic inflammatory conditions, we hypothesize that calprotectin
secreted from BAMs in the CP region may enhance inflammation in an autocrine manner and may also
function in a paracrine manner to disrupt the differentiation, migration, and proliferation of neural progenitor
cells (NPCs) in the periventricular area of the fetal brain. In this proposal, we will test our hypothesis by
measuring calprotectin protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid in response to TLR3-MIA by ELISA (Aim 1) and
by investigating how calprotectin may influence NPC homeostasis in our TLR3-MIA model using single-nuclei
RNA-seq (Aim 2). If our hypothesis is correct, this work will be a first step toward developing a therapeutic
strategy for treating ASD by targeting calprotectin in the fetal brain."
10753570,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microplastics are now recognized as significant emerging environmental pollutants. A subset of microplastics,
microplastic fibres (MPFs), originate from a variety of sources, including their extensive use in textiles. Due to
their high volume use, MPFs contribute significantly to microplastic pollution of the environment on a global
scale. Much of the toxicity and health effects data on MPFs had been directed towards oral exposures whereas
studies associated with inhalation of MPFs are scarce despite epidemiological evidence and more recent work
that has measured MPFs in air. These studies suggest that inhalation exposures are of equal importance to
explore. In addition, these fibers are known to harbor chemical additives, such as azobenzene disperse dyes
(ADDs), that may contribute significantly to toxicity. Studies examining the damage of ADDs to the human
pulmonary system are limited, and no studies have characterized the toxicity of MPFs that harbor ADDs in the
context of human inhalation exposures. Therefore, as one of the first studies to investigate the toxicity of MPF-
containing ADDs we propose to quantify the toxicity of these agents, singly and in combination, to advanced
lung cell cultures via a custom and unique aerosol delivery and exposure system in vitro and determine the
pulmonary effects in vivo. We will focus on mechanisms associated with classical fiber-based toxicity
(pulmonary fibrosis) and on allergic airway disease (asthma) as ADDs are presumed to be chemical sensitizers
(based on dermal studies) and no studies have examined these dyes in this context. Therefore, we propose
the first studies to investigate the toxicity of MPF-containing ADDs to determine whether toxicity is dominated
by classic pro-fibrotic mechanisms (MPFs), respiratory sensitization (ADDs) or both (mixed phenotype). We will
test the overall hypothesis that that the most significant acute lung toxicity of dyed MPFs is attributed to
ADDs that leach from the fibers and act as respiratory sensitizers. Furthermore, respiratory
sensitization is driven, in part, through ADD-protein adduct formation in lung cells, which manifest as
allergic airway disease. Our approach encompasses 2 specific aims; the first to assess toxicity and
associated mechanisms (protein adduct formation) in vitro through aerosolized fibers (undyed and dyed) to
complex epithelial and immune cell cultures; the second aim will focus on documenting pulmonary toxicity in a
mouse model of asthma. These studies would fill a critical void in our understanding of the hazards posed by
ADD-containing MPFs and such lines of research will lead to a better understanding of long term health
consequences and improved risk assessment."

 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that
causes localized damage to myelin, resulting in loss of function, disability, and reduced quality of life. Although
disease-modifying drugs can help reduce the frequency of relapses and onset of new symptoms, this approach
is insufficient for optimal recovery from existing symptoms. One potential approach to overcome functional
impairments related to existing motor deficits is through development of therapeutic strategies that induce
neuroplasticity. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the potential of a novel therapeutic intervention —
Acute Intermittent Hypoxia (AIH) — that has shown significant promise to enhance neuroplasticity in persons
with spinal cord injury but has not yet been studied in MS. AIH constitutes a brief, repeated reduction in oxygen
concentration which stimulates the serotonergic pathway and enhances activity of serotonin receptors. This
results in increased synthesis of plasticity-related proteins that potentiate synaptic transmission and drive
plasticity. We hypothesize that a repeated AIH protocol will improve voluntary limb function in individuals with
MS. We also hypothesize that AIH will induce sustained changes in neural activity within the central nervous
system, which contribute to therapeutic plasticity. We test this hypothesis using a double-blind, sham-controlled
and crossover trial in MS patients with established motor deficits and controlled relapse activity who are
administered mild doses of intermittent hypoxia (or sham hypoxia) for five days. We examine the resulting effects
by quantifying changes in strength, function and walking performance immediately and 1-week post-intervention.
We also use advanced functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques to measure changes in neural
activation during voluntary ankle flexion and intrinsic connectivity in the somatomotor cortices at rest, which have
both shown plasticity-related changes during successful motor rehabilitation strategies. Additional clinical MRI
scans at enrollment and 1-week post-intervention will be monitored for radiologic signs of new disease activity
as part of participant safety monitoring. This proposal will determine the extent to which priming the central
nervous system with an approach known to induce plasticity improves function in MS, and provide evidence of
the neural mechanisms driving these therapeutic effects. The insights gained from this work will inform the
development of more effective therapies combining daily AIH with task specific training for improvement of
function and quality of life in individuals with MS."

Child abuse is a major public health problem, with 8.9/1000 children abused per year (or 656,243 victims in
2019). Infants (≤1-year-old) are particularly vulnerable to abuse, and constitute 45.4% of children who die from
inflicted injuries. Most of these infants are found to have skeletal injuries at the time of death. Skeletal survey
radiographs play a pivotal role in cases of suspected infant abuse for they not only establish the presence of
fractures, they also identify fractures of different ages—a hallmark of infant abuse. In infant abuse investigations,
dating of skeletal injuries from radiographs is vital to reaching a clear timeline of traumatic events. Investigators
typically collect information to determine the presence of potential perpetrators in the victim’s environment at the
time these injuries occurred. Thus, the course of subsequent legal proceedings may depend upon the dates of
these fractures. Although clinical experience, along with the pertinent scientific literature, permit the radiologist
to draw limited conclusions from the radiographs, the task of precisely dating injuries remains challenging. In
short, there is an unmet and critical need for precise and objective dating of fractures in cases of
suspected infant abuse. In this study, we propose to develop an estimation algorithm that harnesses the power
of machine learning (ML)—a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea of computers learning from data—
to help date infant fractures. To this end, we will compare the accuracy performance of an ML-based algorithm
to that of expert radiologists in fracture dating and will validate its clinical utility. In summary, this proposal
presents a new and provocative utilization of ML: To create and clinically validate a new radiology
decision support tool to further the ability of radiologists to date infant fractures with unprecedented
precision and accuracy. Not only will this approach enhance our ability to date individual fractures, but in the
case of multiple injuries, to determine if the fractures occurred at different times. If successful, we expect this
work will aid in reaching more accurate clinical and social assessments leading to improved case outcomes."

Cell-matrix regulation of fibrochondrocytes in TMJ OA
Disorders of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) affect between 3-7% of the population and osteoarthritis (OA)
is the most common pathology associated with TMJ dysfunction. TMJ OA is a disease of cartilage
degeneration and chondrocyte apoptosis. One of the key factors leading to chondrocyte apoptosis is the
suppression of the cytoprotective process of autophagy. Autophagy is one of the earliest cellular responses to
TMJ OA and has been shown to be a viable therapeutic target for attenuating the progression of cartilage
degeneration. A major gap in knowledge is how mechanical and inflammatory stress leads to the eventual
suppression of autophagy, apoptosis, and cartilage degeneration. To address this gap, my lab has developed
expertise in a preclinical, surgical induction mouse model of TMJ OA that closely corresponds to the human
condition and identified a three-step pathogenesis model linking mechanical damage to ECM changes and
chondrocyte apoptosis that includes 1) the depletion of Collagen VI (Col VI) following surgically-induced TMJ
OA 2) the proteolysis of a Col VI chondrocyte receptor, Neuron/Glial antigen 2 (NG2) and 3) the reduction of
autophagy. The overall goal of our study is to test the hypothesis that injury-induced Col VI degeneration
activates an NG2-dependent pathway that accelerates TMJ cartilage degeneration by suppressing autophagy.
Based on the preliminary data included in this application, we have designed a research plan to
mechanistically define how NG2 binding with Col VI is necessary for the maintenance of autophagy through
activation of the mTORC1 pathway. The proposed work is innovative because it focuses on a novel molecular
mechanism of chondrocyte function that contextually links matrix dysfunction with loss of a cytoprotective
cellular mechanism implicated in the progression of TMJ OA. The significance of this research lies in the
potential application to the clinical problems of TMJ OA and represents a leap forward in our knowledge of TMJ
OA pathophysiology. We anticipate that the outcomes of our study will inform new therapeutic approaches with
the potential to attenuate the progression of TMJ OA and restore TMJ health in patients that would otherwise
require alloplastic total joint replacement."

Our primary objective is initiating a personalized approach to curative therapies in children and adults with sickle
cell disease (SCD) to maximize benefits and limit adverse outcomes. Limited systematic efforts exist to elucidate
long-term health outcomes following curative therapies for SCD. The paradigm of focusing only on the initial cure
is analogous to what occurred in pediatric oncology in the 1980s with successful curative therapies.
Subsequently, curative therapies were associated with increased risk for organ dysfunction and malignancies,
leading to a new field, survivorship in pediatric oncology. With emerging curative therapies for SCD (allogeneic
[allo] hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT], gene therapy/editing), long-term health outcomes studies are
time-sensitive and critical to inform personalized choices. Unfortunately, adverse outcomes have started to
emerge after SCD curative therapy. Specifically, 10% of the deaths following HSCT occur more than 5 years
after HSCT. Further, our group has demonstrated therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and clonal hematopoiesis
of indeterminate potential (CHIP) may occur when graft rejection/mixed chimerism is present (seen in 5 of 76
patients with SCD after HSCT). Thus, risks of cure in SCD must be measured against the benefits of cure,
including stabilization of lung function (FEV1) and improved tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity [TRJV]. Ultimately,
the shortened lifespan of individuals with SCD, attributable to declining heart (elevated TRJV), lung (decreased
FEV1), and kidney (decreased eGFR) function, for which curative therapies were designed to ameliorate, must
be measured against favorable and unfavorable late outcomes. In our multicenter retrospective-prospective
cohort, we will test the following hypotheses: 1a): myeloablative curative therapies for children with SCD will
result in progressive pulmonary and renal dysfunction when compared to children with SCD receiving standard
therapy; 1b): nonmyeloablative HSCT for adults with SCD will result in no significant change in FEV1% predicted,
but will lead to accelerated decline in eGFR when compared to adults receiving standard therapy; 2)
nonmyeloablative HSCT for adults with SCD will be associated with a clinically significant improvement in TRJV
following HSCT; and 3) in adults with SCD, proliferative and genotoxic stress uniformly related to
nonmyeloablative allo-HSCT and myeloablative gene editing will lead to post-HSCT therapy-related myeloid
neoplasm of recipient origin. We will address these hypotheses with the following aims: 1) evaluate the incidence
of pulmonary and renal function in 1a: children with SCD receiving myeloablative curative therapies; and 1b:
adults with SCD receiving nonmyeloablative allo-HSCT, compared to a pre-existing cohort of children and adults
with SCD; 2) determine whether there is a clinically significant improvement in TRJV in adults with SCD, at least
half having TRJV > 2.5 m/s, following nonmyeloablative allo-HSCT, and 3) evaluate the prevalence, incidence
and evolution of CHIP following non-myeloablative HSCT or myeloablative gene editing in adults with SCD."
10815822,"Hemophilia A (HA) is a bleeding disorder caused by deficiency or dysfunction of Factor VIII (FVIII), an important
blood coagulation protein. The replacement therapy using exogenous FVIII is the first line of therapy. However,
a major clinical complication of this life-saving therapy is the development of neutralizing anti-FVIII antibodies,
referred to as inhibitors, that abrogates the biological activity of FVIII and increases the risk of bleeding related
morbidity and mortality in HA patients. Current clinical options after inhibitor development are costly (>$700,000
per patient annually) and in some patients, ineffective. Thus, prevention of inhibitor development is cost-effective
in terms of patient care but there are no safe and effective preventive therapy currently available to avoid inhibitor
development. The overall objective of this application is to develop a tolerogenic form of FVIII (TOLIP-FVIII) as
a novel immunotherapy to prevent inhibitor development in HA. This platform technology has been developed
with NHLBI support to PI that harnesses the tolerogenic property of our proprietary lysophosphatidylserine
(lysoPS) nanoparticle. We observed that an oral and intravenous (IV) pre-administration of FVIII associated with
lysoPS effectively reduced inhibitor development in naïve HA mice when challenged with free FVIII, suggesting
that FVIII-lysoPS (TOLIP-FVIII) is a tolerogenic form of FVIII that could prevent inhibitor development. As the
risk of inhibitor development is much higher during the first 20 exposures of FVIII, we envision this tolerogenic
form as beginner replacement therapy during high-risk exposure period, for previously untreated patients
(PUPs), to durably prevent inhibitor development. Further, due to improved plasma survival, this could also be a
longer acting FVIII for all HA patients. In R61 phase, we propose to (1) develop immunization protocol for durable
tolerance; (2) determine the half-life and hemostatic efficacy of IV administered TOLIP-FVIII by conducting
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in HA mice and (3) to investigate the toxicity of iv administered
TOLIP-FVIII in mice and in non-human primates. These SAs present measurable milestones, identification of
optimal immunization/treatment protocol for durable tolerance, non-inferior PK and hemostatic efficacy and
acceptable safety profile. As part of R33, in year 3, we will (1) investigate whether this TOLIP-FVIII approach
that is successful in HA mice can be translated to HA dogs and (2) characterize PK/PD of this tolerogenic form
of FVIII in HA dogs. Collaborations have been established with National Primate Center to investigate toxicity of
TOLIP-FVIII in non-human primates and with the University of North Carolina to conduct HA dog studies. We
propose a detailed project management plan and partnered with Empire Discovery Institute for R33 phase of the
project. Successful completion of the project will lead to a novel immunotherapy platform to prevent inhibitor
development in HA and could also lay the foundation for innovative therapeutic options with broad clinical
potential, such as prevention of immunogenicity of other therapeutic proteins, improve gene therapy and CRISPR
outcomes, and treat autoimmune conditions and allergies."

The goal of this renewal application is to determine if blocking the mechanisms involved in intracellular HSV-1
gK processing and trafficking to the cell surface reduces virus replication and infectivity and thereby corneal
scarring (CS). It is well established that CS is the result of virus-induced immune responses although the
identity of the pathogenic responses is controversial. Similarly, the HSV-1 gene(s) involved in eye disease is
not yet known although several lines of evidence indicate that gK plays a crucial role in replication and
infectivity as exemplified by the inability of HSV-1 gK mutants to grow in cells lacking gK as they fail to acquire
a cytoplasmic envelope efficiently and are unable to infect and establish latency in neurons. Our progress
during the current funding period has provided novel insights into potential mechanisms of regulating gK
expression in conjunction with its binding to UL20 and suggest that SPP may define the extent of primary
infections, latency-reactivation, and CS. We have now shown that: (1) Binding of gK to SPP and UL20 to
GODZ is required for HSV-1-induced CS; and (2) Amino acids 31-46 of gK are involved in binding to SPP, aa
280-295 of gK bind to UL20, and aa 51-65 of UL20 bind to GODZ (preliminary studies). These observations
suggest mechanisms that may reveal innovative potential therapeutic targets to prevent ocular HSV-1 infection
and CS. Based on our data, we suggest a hypothetical model of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenic
effects of gK. In this model, the pathogenic effects of gK during primary ocular infection are mediated by two
different, but interrelated, mechanisms in which (i) gK binds to SPP in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
UL20 in the Golgi, leading to increased virus replication and cell surface expression of gK that is necessary for
gK-induced CS and increased eye disease; and (ii) UL20 also binds to GODZ in the Golgi, which is required for
cell surface expression of gK. Thus, potential therapies might include blocking of gK-SPP, gK-UL20, UL20-
GODZ interactions, or a combination of these strategies. We will test a hypothetical model in which the
pathogenic effects of gK during primary ocular infection is mediated by three inter-related mechanisms: (i) gK
binds to SPP leading to higher levels of virus replication; (ii) gK binds to UL20, which is required for the cell
surface expression of gK; and (iii) UL20 binds to GODZ, which is required for UL20 palmitoylation and thus its
proper binding to gK. We will: (1) Test the hypothesis that complete absence of SPP in peripheral nerves or
eyes will reduce primary HSV-1 infection, latency-reactivation, and eye disease in ocularly infected mice
compared with tamoxifen-inducible SPP depleted mice; and (2) Identifying effective therapeutic targets to
reduce HSV-1 primary infection, latency-reactivation, and thus HSV-1-induced CS. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
HSV-1-induced CS can lead to blindness and is the leading cause of infectious blindness in developed
countries but there is no FDA approved drug for its treatment. The proposed studies represent an entirely novel
approach to the development of effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of this disease."
10817257,"Tissue damage caused by trauma or chronic illness reduces quality of life and shortens life expectancy. The
ability to regulate the endogenous response to damage, and to induce regenerative growth, would have profound
implications for the field of regenerative medicine. The Smith-Bolton lab has developed innovative techniques
to: 1) induce tissue damage in hundreds of animals simultaneously, enabling the use of powerful Drosophila
genetics to identify mechanisms that regulate tissue regeneration, and 2) isolate the regenerating tissue, ena-
bling high-throughput genomic approaches to characterize the molecular mechanisms that underly regeneration
control. The long-term goal of the Smith-Bolton lab is to understand how damaged tissue regenerates a func-
tional structure. During the past five years, funded by NIH R01GM107140 “Regulation of Cell Fate and Patterning
during Regenerative Growth”, the lab has used genetic and genomic techniques to 1) demonstrate that regen-
eration signaling and unconstrained expression of regeneration growth factors have deleterious side effects, 2)
identify several protective factors that prevent these unwanted outcomes, and 3) identify multiple mechanisms
through which the magnitude and duration of regeneration signaling are tightly controlled. The purpose of this
R35 MIRA application is to obtain stable and flexible funding to continue our successful and innovative work
identifying the intricate pathways that control tissue regeneration. Important questions remain unanswered, such
as 1) How do tissue-damage signals induce the changes in gene expression that carry out each step in regen-
eration? 2) How does the regenerating tissue switch back to its normal patterning and gene expression profile?
3) Does regeneration recapitulate development, or are there regeneration-specific patterning controls? The re-
search programs in the Smith-Bolton lab over the next five years will seek to achieve specific goals, including
using genetic, genomic, and molecular techniques to: 1) identify the transcription factors and the genetic targets
of those factors that constitute the gene regulatory networks that control individual steps in regeneration, 2)
provide a detailed understanding of how key genomic loci are regulated after tissue damage, 3) elucidate the
mechanism through which regenerating tissue returns to normal, and 4) identify additional regeneration-specific
regulators of cell fate and patterning. When this work is complete, we will have a mechanistic understanding of
how regeneration can derail cell fate, and the variety of mechanisms used to prevent catastrophic changes in
gene expression after tissue damage. This work will have a critical positive impact because strategies developed
to induce medically relevant regrowth of tissue after acute injury or chronic illness must account for deleterious
side effects of pro-regeneration signals and incorporate protective factors to prevent aberrations. Furthermore,
this work will identify candidate genes that can be targeted to manipulate specific aspects of the tissue damage
response, while avoiding unwanted effects such as overstimulation of the wound response or unregulated pro-
liferation, both in model systems and in humans."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) affects 5.5 million Americans. The number of people in the
US with ADRD is expected to increase to 16 million by 2050 unless preventive interventions and effective
treatments are developed. Despite advances in ADRD research among non-Hispanic Whites, little is known
about the prevalence and risk factors for ADRD in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. This
is in part due to low participation of AI/ANs in ADRD research. The National Institute on Aging and the
Alzheimer’s Association have issued calls for an increase in minority participation in clinical trials. However,
success has been evasive in efforts to recruit AI/AN populations into ADRD clinical studies. The internet is a
primary method for providing information about ADRD and recruiting participants into clinical studies. AI/ANs
frequently use the internet for health information but also report that the websites they access lack cultural
sensitivity. To increase AI/AN participation in ADRD research, it is critical to understand how AI/ANs consume
and process online information. This information can be used to create effective communication and recruitment
material for ADRD clinical studies. In this K01, we will apply a multi-method approach to assess how AI/ANs
process and consume online material. Using this information, we will create culturally tailored online content to
educate AI/ANs about ADRD to promote their enrollment into ADRD research. Our Specific Aims are to: 1)
conduct psychophysiology testing and semi-structured interviews to characterize visual website search patterns,
objectively measured cognitive and emotional responses, knowledge about ADRD and research, and
preferences for accessing health information online; 2) create a culturally tailored educational ADRD website for
AI/ANs that offers research opportunities and conduct a pilot study to demonstrate feasibility of a future
randomized controlled trial; and 3) complete a rigorous training plan that will position the applicant as an
independent investigator and leader in communication with underserved populations, especially AI/ANs. This
innovative application provides an opportunity to discover critical information about how AI/ANs process
information and answers the National Institute on Aging’s call for research to better understand effective
strategies for recruiting minorities into ADRD research and communicating health messages that are appropriate
for diverse populations."

Economically disadvantaged mothers of young children experience disproportionately high rates of depressive
symptoms, yet often do not receive treatment due to instrumental and psychological barriers. Remission of
maternal depression relates to improvements in both parenting behavior and child functioning, suggesting that
treatment of maternal depression has the potential to improve outcomes across generations. To increase access
to evidence-based depression treatment in this population, we developed Mom-Net, a coach-guided, e-health
intervention for depressed mothers of young children. Mom-Net is coach-guided, given evidence that guided
interventions produce significantly higher levels of engagement and effectiveness than unguided interventions.
Mom-Net has demonstrated effectiveness in two controlled trials with low-income depressed mothers, with
effectiveness derived from in-person coach training by a professional Mom-Net trainer. To increase Mom-Net
dissemination, our Phase I SBIR efforts focused on developing and evaluating remote coach-training prototypes
for paraprofessionals, replicating the in-person training program. Remote coach training includes self-guided
online sessions, webinar live practice sessions with a professional trainer, and a certification process. At the end
of Phase I, we received funding for a Mom-Net hybrid, type II implementation-effectiveness study
(R01MH120237), resulting in quick expansion of the Phase 1 prototypes into a completed remote training
process as a necessary component of the trial. The current Phase II project builds upon the R01 effort and a
positive evaluation and successful realization of Phase I project goals. Phase II aims to: 1) create a remote Train-
the-Trainer program and Administrative Portal, allowing community settings to internally train and monitor their
own staff; 2) evaluate the Train-the-Trainer program on the primary outcomes of session completion, Mom-Net
content and coaching skills knowledge, teaching strategy knowledge, and fidelity in observed trainer use of
teaching strategies; 3) examine effectiveness equivalence between the two Mom-Net coach training options in
a randomized trial in 33 Head Start agencies. Four staff within each agency (n = 132) will serve as
paraprofessional coach trainees, randomized to be trained by either the external professional coach trainer or
the trainer within the agency. Equivalency will be evaluated on session completion, Mom-Net content mastery,
and fidelity in coaching skills. The proposed project, culminating in training at scale by offering two training
options, will enable commercialization and broader dissemination of Mom-Net which, in turn, will contribute to
greater access to a vulnerable, underserved population of mothers experiencing depressive symptoms."

 CRISPR holds great promise toward therapeutically editing pathological mutations in the gene fused in
sarcoma (FUS), known to cause 5% of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
cases. The FUS gene is ideal for therapeutic editing, as it is a dominant-negative genetic mutation, allowing for
one allele to produce enough of the FUS protein for cells to survive. However, there are several challenges that
must be addressed before this promise can be realized, including the inefficient delivery of Cas9 and gRNA into
cells and the lack of indel formation after Cas9 cleavage. Towards this, my lab has established a robust neuronal
differentiation protocol via doxycycline-inducible transcription factors. With this protocol, I can derive phenotypic
neurons from iPSCs that recapitulate disease phenotypes within 7 days13. We have additionally engineered
virus-like particles (VLP), that harbor no genetic material, to deliver Cas9 protein and gRNA to neurons12. In this
grant, I propose exploring small perturbations within neurons to gain further insights into how CRISPR therapies
can be designed for the precise editing of neurodegenerative diseases.
 I have collected preliminary data with neurons and iPSCs, using the same CRISPR editing strategy, and
found that iPSCs and neurons have divergent editing outcomes. Specifically, we used gRNA designed to cleave
sequences in the NEFL and B2M genes. In both genes, we found that iPSCs had multiple editing outcomes not
present in neurons, commonly large deletions. Editing in neurons frequently resulted in no indel being produced.
The few indels that do occur in neurons appear to be almost exclusively small insertions (+1 indel) are produced
via mutagenic NHEJ. These small indels are ideal to cause frameshifts and induce nonsense-mediated decay
and represent an optimal strategy for therapeutic editing in neurons.
 I propose studying how iPSC-neurons can be perturbed to increase the prevalence of our desired editing
outcome. Using our directed differentiation protocol as well as our VLP delivery system, I will explore how indel
frequency and identity are affected by changes in the transcription of the edited gene and the expression and
activity of DNA damage proteins. In Aim 1, I will alter the transcription of genes to explore how interactions with
RNA polymerase change editing frequency and indel formation. In Aim 2, I will investigate how changing the
expression or activity of DNA repair enzymes affects editing outcomes.
 The insight gained from the work described in this grant can be used to precisely edit neurons to silence
pathological genetic mutations, like FUS mutations. Future studies would also apply this editing strategy to other
mutated genes in neurons and potentially other post-mitotic cells. The superior training environment provided at
the Gladstone Institutes will allow me the opportunity to explore these aims with expert research mentorship,
support from core facilities, and beneficial collaborations."

 Siglecs in the Porcine Oviduct: Roles in the Formation of the Sperm Reservoir and Sperm Immune
Response
 In mammals, only a small fraction of the deposited spermatozoa in the female reproductive tract reach
the oviduct. Once in the oviduct, sperm bind to the oviductal epithelium, forming the functional sperm reservoir,
which is crucial in prolonging sperm lifespan by inducing sperm into a quiescent state and providing these
foreign gametes with an immune-suppressed environment. Siglecs are immunomodulatory receptors that
recognize sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates. Using the pig as a model, we have discovered the presence
of up to eight different Siglecs in the porcine oviduct, five of which are immune inhibitory. We have also
characterized the N- and O-glycans and glycolipids present in porcine spermatozoa. Our results have identified
the presence of several sialic acid-containing glycoconjugates on porcine sperm that are ligands for Siglecs.
We hypothesize that the interactions of sialylated glycans of sperm with Siglecs from the oviduct are essential
for sperm adhesion to the epithelium and sperm survival by suppressing leukocyte infiltration and the local
innate immune response. The overall goal of this study is to develop a clear understanding of the role of
Siglecs in the oviduct and sperm sialic acids during the formation of the sperm reservoir. The Specific Aims are
1) to determine the cellular location and abundance of Siglecs in the oviduct epithelium and sialic acid
terminating glycans on sperm, 2) to determine the role of Siglec-1 and other Siglecs in sperm adhesion to
oviduct cells, and 3) to determine the role of oviduct Siglecs in local immune regulation upon sperm-oviduct
interactions. To address these aims I will utilize a combination of biochemical, cell and molecular, biological,
and genomic approaches along with both in-vitro and in-vivo models. The findings from this study have
practical applications such as enhanced diagnosis of idiopathic infertility and the development of novel
approaches to regulating fertility such as the discovery of new contraceptive targets.
 This research training plan will provide me with training in a variety of cutting-edge and foundational
techniques using an interdisciplinary approach that includes reproduction, immunology, and glycobiology.
Moreover, it will support opportunities for career development to prepare me for a successful career in science.
The outstanding scientific environment of the University of Illinois will provide me with multiple learning
opportunities and the resources to accomplish this study. Dr. Miller, with proven mentoring experience and
expertise in the study of the sperm-oviduct interaction, as well as my co-sponsors Dr. McKim and Dr. Nowak,
will guide me in the success of the proposed research training plan and my scientific career development."
10775770,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For the 786,000 people in the United States living with end stage renal disease (ESRD), the treatment of
choice is kidney transplantation. While transplant life has subtly increased over the last 15 years, ten-year graft
survival rates are only 28% for deceased-donor and 46% for living-donor grafts. The primary cause of graft
failure after the first year is antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), the detrimental impacts of which are
compounded by concurrent fibrosis. Thus, there is an urgent yet unmet need to prolong graft life by
remediating AMR prior to extensive fibrotic changes and other severe, irreversible graft damage. Therapeutic
interventions to remediate AMR are not FDA approved or clinically standardized due to their inconsistent and
often suboptimal performances. Promising treatment protocols are in development, but their translation to
clinical trials will require frequent monitoring of AMR response that cannot be supported by the current
evaluation standard, invasive biopsy, due to its associated safety risks. A safer alternative involves tracking
surrogate serum and urine biomarkers, but these markers are nonspecific with unclear diagnostic thresholds,
and measurable fluctuations in their values may occur well after underlying pathological changes to the
allograft. Another safe alternative to biopsy is imaging, most often ultrasound, which also indicates AMR
nonspecifically. The lack of a noninvasive and specific method for detecting AMR and routinely monitoring its
response to treatment in renal transplant patients represents a major gap in prolonging graft life. To fill this
gap, our group has spent the first five-year cycle of this grant award developing noninvasive Viscoelastic
Response (VisR) ultrasound for monitoring renal transplant status. Our research has demonstrated that in vivo
VisR assessments of elastic and viscous differences across the medulla and cortex, as well as medullary and
cortical elastic and viscous anisotropy, delineate renal inflammation and fibrosis in a pig model. Further, in a
pilot clinical feasibility study, our research has shown that in vivo VisR differentiates biopsy-confirmed
tubulointerstitial fibrosis in the allografts of human patients imaged serially from time of implantation. The
success of our investigations thus far motivates further advancement of VisR technology and its extension to
noninvasively detecting and monitoring AMR. Specifically, we will augment the VisR methods developed in the
first funding cycle with a new approach to anisotropy measurement (angle interpolation) and a new imaging
method (Double Profile Intersection (DoPIo) ultrasound) to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting
inflammation, a hallmark of AMR. We will apply the advanced VisR and DoPIo methods to identifying AMR and
monitoring its response to treatment in human renal transplant patients. We hypothesize that advanced VisR
and DoPIo ultrasound delineate biopsy-confirmed inflammation associated with AMR in human renal transplant
patients, in vivo, which is relevant to noninvasively monitoring response to AMR treatment."
10753586,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic pain afflicts millions of patients, yet treatments are largely ineffective, and development of new, targeted
therapies is limited by knowledge gaps in the neurobiology of pain. Despite recent progress, key questions
remain about the incredibly complex cellular and functional organization of ascending and descending neural
circuits that control pain processing. Answering these questions is essential for developing new, more
efficacious, and better targeted therapeutics for acute and chronic pain. The main objective of this proposal is to
identify the circuit connections and synaptic mechanisms of a novel group of neurons that we recently discovered
in the lateral pons. Situated juxta the A5 noradrenergic cell group, these neurons (which we termed LJA5)
express prodynorphin and glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (GAD1). They are distinct from the A5 noradrenergic
neurons as they do not express tyrosine hydroxylase. LJA5 neurons project to all spinal levels of lamina I of the
dorsal horn (DH), as well as to the parabrachial nucleus (PB) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Notably, we
showed that these neurons play an important role in pain regulation. Specifically, chemogenetic activation of
LJA5 neurons suppressed capsaicin- and inflammation-induced mechanical pain, but not thermal sensitivity,
whereas chemogenetic inhibition of LJA5 enhanced mechanical hypersensitivity during inflammation. Our
preliminary data also showed that chemogenetic activation of LJA5 neurons strongly attenuated neuropathic
pain both via systemic and intrathecal administration of a designer drug. Collectively, these findings suggest that
LJA5 neurons and their projections represent a novel component of descending pain modulation, and also pose
many important questions about this novel circuit: 1) Which types of pain are regulated by LJA5 neurons? 2)
What are the key projections/outputs of LJA5 neurons? 3) What synaptic mechanisms are utilized by LJA5
neurons? Our central hypothesis is that LJA5 neurons modulate pain processing by controlling synaptic
transmission in lamina I of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We will test this hypothesis in 3 specific aims by
using a multidisciplinary approach that includes chemogenetic manipulation combined with behavioral testing,
patch-clamp recording in innovative intact spinal cord preparation and 2-photon Ca2+ imaging in axonal boutons
of primary afferent central terminals. Aim 1 will establish the role of LJA5 neurons in mouse models of
inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Aim 2 will examine functional significance of the main LJA5 projections. Aim
3 will determine synaptic mechanisms that mediate the antinociceptive effects of LJA5 neurons in the spinal
cord. This proposal will define fundamental characteristics of a novel descending pathway involved in pain
modulation, including its functional connectivity, synaptic mechanisms and its role in acute and chronic pain
states. This work is transformative because it identifies a novel bulbospinal pain modulatory pathway, a
significant advance in our basic understanding of pain that may offer alternative approaches to pain control."
10837152,"The rapidly changing landscape of cannabis policy in the United States is well known, but often overlooked is
that legalization has made high-potency products more available. State-regulated cannabis markets offer
access to cannabis products, such as concentrates with THC potencies (70-90%) that far exceed cannabis that
has been sold on the black market over the last 20 years (4-12% THC potency). State reporting suggests that
concentrates are commonly used and quickly rising in popularity, with increases in 2014-2019 sales (409%) far
outpacing that of flower (80% increase) and edibles (234% increase). Recent data indicate that concentrate
users exhibit higher plasma THC levels than flower users and a large body of research has demonstrated
dose-response relationships between increasing cannabis consumption and poor mental health outcomes.
Given the increasing prevalence of concentrate use, it is imperative to clearly understand how these
increasingly popular, high-potency cannabis products affect mental health and psychosocial
functioning. This project leverages an ongoing, longitudinal twin study, with participants assessed
approximately every 5 years since adolescence. Thus, this project is a unique opportunity to rigorously test
critical hypotheses about how high-potency concentrates affect psychopathology and psychosocial functioning.
The Aims of this research are:
Aim 1: Examine how the use of different cannabis products relates to cannabinoid exposure (e.g.,
THC). We will test whether the use of high-potency cannabis concentrates, compared to flower products, is
associated with elevated cannabinoid exposure. We hypothesize that associations will not be explained by
familial confounds (via co-twin comparisons) and individual differences (via repeated assessments).
Alternatively, it is possible that concentrate users titrate to reach the same effect as flower users.
Aim 2: Examine how the use of different cannabis products relates to mental health and psychosocial
functioning. It is plausible that individuals vary in their propensity to use high-potency concentrates. Thus, we
will examine how use of high-potency concentrates relate to mental health while accounting for familial and
individual confounds, like genetics and prior substance use. We hypothesize that twins who uses more high-
potency concentrates will tend to have greater levels of depression, anxiety, and impulsivity and psychosocial
dysfunction compared to their co-twins who use flower or who use high-potency concentrates less frequently.
Aim 3: Test whether different levels of cannabinoid exposure are associated with mental health and
psychosocial outcomes. We will test how different levels of cannabinoid exposure (i.e., THC-COOH
concentrations in whole blood) associate with depression, anxiety, and impulsivity as well as psychosocial
functioning. That is, we will directly test the hypothesis that cannabinoid exposure is associated with mental
health and psychosocial functioning. We hypothesize that higher levels of cannabinoid exposure will be
associated with worse symptoms of mental health and psychosocial functioning."
10873060,"Current pharmacological treatments for PTSD and comorbid depression are inadequate. These stress-
related psychiatric illnesses of high significance and impact to the veteran population, and finding more effective
treatments would satisfy a tremendous gap in veterans’ health care. Evidence-based behavioral therapies, such
as exposure therapy, are promising, but they also have limited efficacy. The lack of effective treatment arises,
in part, from our lack of knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these illnesses, the altered
regulatory processes that lead to pathology, the neural systems that mediate the dimensions of cognition and
adaptive coping behavior that are disrupted in these illnesses, and the mechanisms responsible for effective
therapeutic response in any modality, pharmacological or behavioral. Such knowledge may inform a more
targeted approach to increase therapeutic efficacy. To better study these processes, in the previous grant period
we developed, validated and characterized extinction learning in rats as a model of exposure therapy in comorbid
PTSD and depression. We demonstrated the efficacy of extinction in reversing behavioral and physiological
deficits following chronic unpredictable stress. We showed that these effects were dependent upon activity in
the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during extinction for the therapeutic effects seen 24 hrs after treatment. And
we showed that the therapeutic effects of extinction were dependent on the induction of de novo protein synthesis
in the mPFC, which we believe represents the initiation of processes related to plasticity and changes in circuit
function in this brain region. In this proposal for renewal, we will characterize the precise circuit-level plasticity
and signaling mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic effects of extinction on a range of behavioral measures
modeling different dimensions of comorbid PTSD and depression after chronic unpredictable stress exposure.
 In aim 1, using a virogenetic inhibitory DREADD strategy, we will investigate the role of specific efferent
projections of the infralimbic (IL) and prelimbic (PL) sub-regions of mPFC to target regions that mediate specific
behavioral response domains relevant to comorbid PTSD and depression, and to the therapeutic efficacy of
exposure therapy. In aim 2, we will investigate the role of afferent projections to the IL and PL cortices arising
from the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventral hippocampus in the therapeutic effects of extinction. We will also
test the hypothesis that BDNF signaling during extinction, induced specifically by activity in ventral hippocampal
afferent, initiates signal transduction processes in the mPFC necessary for the plasticity that is ultimately
responsible for the beneficial behavioral effects seen 24 hours after extinction. With this knowledge, in aim 3,
we will then test a rational adjunct treatment strategy combining a sub-effective extinction protocol with a sub-
effective dose of a novel candidate pharmacotherapeutic agent, L-655,708, that activates signaling pathways
and/or neural circuits convergent with those activated by extinction, to determine if this strategy can increase the
efficacy of extinction. We have established the utility of the adjunct therapy strategy to detect enhanced efficacy
using ketamine, an established therapeutic agent. The proposed investigation of potential therapeutic utility of
L-655,708 is a high-risk high-gain undertaking, as the likelihood of success is less clear. L-655,708 is a selective
negative allosteric modulator of the a5 subtype of the GABA-A receptor that is relatively specifically expressed
in the ventral hippocampus, a major afferent to the IL cortex that we believe plays an important role in therapeutic
efficacy after chronic stress. The ultimate goal of this research is to inform the development of more effective
treatments for PTSD and comorbid depression, to improve the quality of life for veterans and their families.
 The PI and the MPI are well established VA investigators with a long history of productive collaboration and
complementary expertise in stress neurobiology, psychopharmacology, animal models and systems
neurobiology. They and their labs are ideally suited to the successful conduct of this project."
10874451,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) mutually reinforce each other leading to
poor outcomes in patients. This is a significant issue in the Veteran population in whom the incidences of both
AKI and CKD are increased. Moreover, both conditions are associated with significant comorbidities including
diabetes, HTN and cardiovascular disease and high mortality. After AKI, patients are at increased risk of
progression to CKD. Meanwhile, CKD predisposes patients to AKI and frequently impedes recovery from it.
Despite several clinical studies identifying these harmful interactions, the underlying mechanisms remain
elusive. This proposal directly addresses the gap in knowledge of the mechanisms by which CKD
negatively impacts recovery from AKI and proposes to advance novel therapeutics for this
important problem effecting the health of the Veteran population.
 Typically, kidney proximal tubules support high levels of transport fueled by mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with limited glycolytic capacity. However, preliminary data demonstrates
significant alterations in proximal tubular metabolism with increased glycolysis in the subtotal nephrectomy
model of CKD. Prior data implicate a role for diminished activity of AMP-Kinase (AMPK) pathway, which is a
central energy sensor and regulator of metabolism in cells. Additionally, alterations in tubular metabolism and
impaired mitochondrial function are also seen after AKI. How tubular metabolism and transport evolve after
AKI and how pre-existing changes in these factors impact tubular recovery is not known and will be addressed
in this proposal. The specific aims of the project include investigating the role of AMPK in proximal tubular
reprogramming in CKD and AKI and how pre-existing changes in tubular metabolism and transport impact
recovery from AKI. The proposed work will be accomplished utilizing novel methodologies to assess tubular
metabolism combined with contemporary molecular methods and classical, physiological techniques such as
renal micropuncture to provide mechanistic insights into proximal tubular transport and its relevance to tubular
metabolism (oxidative and glycolytic) in recovery from AKI in CKD. Validation of pertinent findings in other
injury models and translational relevance to clinical disease will also be assessed.
 These investigations will provide important and novel insights into the early mechanisms of disease
progression and identify treatment strategies that can be employed early to prevent the usual course of disease
progression. The understanding obtained from these investigations will be valuable beyond the model studied
given the universal implications of cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in various
pathophysiological conditions in several organs. Importantly, the high clinical relevance and direct relevance to
the health of the Veteran population lend significant impact to the proposed research."
10873062,"We seek to develop a potent Pharmachin derivative with activity against blood forms of P. falciparum and P.
vivax. It is our ultimate goal to develop an inexpensive anti-malarial that is safe for use in G6PD deficient
individuals, and in the most vulnerable populations, i.e., pregnant women and children, and can be administered
by oral and parenteral routes for weekly chemo-prevention as well as treatment of malaria, including severe
malaria. Our 4-year goal for this VA Merit Review Award is to identify two lead molecules and to carry both
molecules through the preclinical tests outlined here to provide sufficient information on each to warrant efficacy
trials in preclinical species (beyond the budget and scope of the work proposed here) infected with P. falciparum
or P. cynomolgi (a surrogate model for vivax malaria). More specifically, we hope to advance a Pharmachin,
possibly late lead candidate PH-284, with a projection from the 3-position of the quinoline ring, for more advanced
studies. We will also explore the amodiaquine scaffold to create a new series that we refer to as “Amodiachins”
where we have moved this key structural feature to the 4-position for reasons described below. It is also our goal
to advance one of these Amodiachin constructs for advanced preclinical testing as well.
 We believe that the combination of a relatively low developmental safety risk together with a high likelihood
for therapeutic success in this endeavor (i.e., given the structural similarities to CQ and amodiaquine and the
long history of their clinical use worldwide for treatment of malaria) will attract the attention of Big Pharma, the
US DOD and the MMV for advancement of a fast-acting 3-substituted-pharmachin and/or an 4-position-modified
amodiachin for use in humans. We hypothesize that members of these two series will serve as lead candidates
for consideration as 4-aminoquinoline replacement drugs for worldwide use. Our strategic plan is to optimize
these two scaffolds for: 1) anti-plasmodial activity, 2) antimalarial efficacy (in vivo mouse model), 3) low
mammalian cell cytotoxicity, 4) enhanced metabolic stability (in vitro), 4) improved oral pharmacokinetics
(extended T1/2 and increased AUC/exposure), and 5) improved safety/cardiotoxicity risk (diminished inhibition of
herg channel, >30µM), and overall suitability to MMV’s Target Product Profiles TPP1 (treatment of uncomplicated
as well as severe malaria) and TPP2 (use in chemoprevention). Our experience of working with the MMV towards
the preclinical development of prodrug ELQ-331 for treatment and prophylaxis against malaria should accelerate
the transformation of optimized Pharmachins and Amodiachins from concept/design to frontrunners to late leads
and preclinical candidates that gain acceptance into their developmental pipeline for clinical use."
10853128,"ABSTRACT
The substantial heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a key barrier in early diagnosis and in developing
and evaluating effective treatments for the disorder. Although early behavioral intervention targeting social,
cognitive, and adaptive functioning improves outcomes for many children with ASD, there is significant variability in
treatment response within studies. Given this variation, stratifying the heterogeneity of ASD is essential for identifying
biomarkers to help providers systematically diagnose, tailor treatment, and monitor response. The proposed project
responds to this critical need by elucidating the impact of a potential key source of this heterogeneity: co-occurring
anxiety and ADHD. Little is known about the unique and additive impacts of co-occurring anxiety and ADHD on
individuals with autism in the early childhood period. Furthermore, the impact of these co-occurring disorders on
commonly used neural and behavioral biomarkers remains a gap in the current literature. To fill these gaps in the
literature, we propose a multimodal approach, using a combination of parent reports, observational assessments,
and neurophysiological assays, to carefully phenotype samples of young children from 4 groups: ASD alone,
ASD+Anxiety, ASD+ADHD, and ASD+Anxiety+ADHD. Our central hypothesis is that co-occurring anxiety or ADHD
will have both unique and additive effects on the clinical presentation, executive functioning, and biomarker
signatures of young children with ASD. To test this hypothesis, we have three aims: (1) Differentiate the impact of
co-occurring anxiety or ADHD on core and associated symptoms in young children with ASD. (2) Identify the
relationship between co-occurring anxiety or ADHD and executive function deficits in young children with ASD. (3)
Determine the relationship between co-occurring anxiety or ADHD and neural, attentional, and behavioral
biomarkers being used to characterize and monitor treatments in ASD. If successful, this project will provide a better
understanding of the impact of co-occurring ADHD and anxiety on the clinical presentation, functional outcomes,
and neurobiology of ASD. This in turn will improve our ability to stratify young children with ASD into meaningful
subgroups. This knowledge will support development of effective and biologically informed methods for early
detection and treatment, which can mitigate the negative effects of co-occurring ADHD and anxiety on long-term
outcomes of individuals with ASD."
10845507,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maintenance of tissue function during adulthood, and hence suppression of tissue degeneration and disease,
depends on maintenance of stem cell populations. Adult stem cells are epigenetically programmed and a
culmination of a series of developmental decisions initiated in the embryo. In utero environmental exposures on
the embryo can influence adult and late-life disease, likely in part via effects on stem cell development that are
transmitted to maintenance and function of stem cells in the adult. However, the molecular links between
embryonic development and long-term maintenance of stem cell function and phenotype in adults are poorly
defined. We will employ lineage-specific genetic inactivation of a histone chaperone to understand how
embryonic developmental integrity of melanoblasts (Mb) impacts on maintenance adult melanocyte (Mc) stem
cells (McSC).
The histone chaperone HIRA deposits histone variant H3.3 into active genes, promoters and enhancers.
Through in vitro and in vivo studies and single cell RNA-seq of mouse embryo melanoblasts (Mbs) from wild
type mice and mice lacking expression of HIRA in embryonic Mbs, we have uncovered a role for HIRA in
sustaining the PAX3/SOX10-MITF Mb specification pathway. Inactivation of HIRA in Mbs depletes the number
of Mbs in early/mid stage embryos. However, this embryonic defect is rescued by birth and young mice exhibit
normal numbers of melanocytic cells, and only a very subtle pigmentation defect. Nevertheless, in new-born
mice, Hira knock out (KO) melanocytic cells exhibit a higher frequency of telomere-associated DNA damage foci,
indicating that Hira knock out McSC and/or melanocytes harbor molecular damage, even in new-born mice.
Indeed, melanoblasts and melanocytes from new-born Hira KO mice respond poorly to pro-proliferative
challenge in vitro and in vivo, and these mice show marked accelerated McSC and melanocyte depletion and
dramatically accelerated hair greying during adulthood. Building on these extensive preliminary data, we will
investigate the role of HIRA in differentiation and development of the melanocytic lineage, and investigate the
links between abnormal embryonic development and adult stem cell depletion during adulthood and aging.
Dysregulation of the PAX3/SOX10-MITF signaling pathway contributes to developmental disorders and
melanoma. These studies to define HIRA's role in the PAX3/SOX10-MITF axis can promote therapeutic
interventions to combat these developmental and neoplastic disorders. Moreover, completion of these Specific
Aims will address how the integrity of embryonic development of tissue specific stem cells impacts maintenance
of those stem cells during adulthood."
10845288,"How do the neural circuits controlling movement combine sensory information, memories of past experiences, and internal state information (e.g. thirst, arousal, anger, fear) to produce even simple actions? And how does descending command activity change when a specific action (e.g. a lick in a specific direction) is made for different reasons (e.g. a reflexive vs. memory-guided lick)? Individual motor neurons receive thousands of inputs from across the brain and then integrate that information nonlinearly over dendritic arbors that span hundreds of microns. This complexity makes it difficult to assign a specific causative role to any single upstream circuit. Indeed, past studies have shown that many parallel circuits, from those involving cortex, the superior colliculus, the red nucleus, and simple reflexes in the brainstem, are each involved in driving similar orofacial movements. However, comparatively little is known about how these different pathways normally coordinate their activity with each other during normal behavior. One consequence of this gap in understanding pertains to disease. While many neurological impairments cause localized damage to movement-related brain regions (e.g. motor neuron degeneration in ALS, or the areas surrounding an infarction following a stroke), it is still unclear why some lesions cause permanent deficits while others can be compensated for by changes in the neural activity of other circuits in unaffected parts of the brain. The goal of this project is to discover the logic governing the coordination between different descending motor pathways, to determine how their recruitment depends on brain state (e.g. thirst or arousal), and to measure how such coordination changes following an acute or chronic brain injury. To do this, we will use recently developed large-scale neural recording technologies to interrogate many brain areas— including the motor nuclei themselves. First, using a new method for simultaneously monitoring many areas across dorsal cortex using Ca2+ imaging, I will explore the structure of neural activity contained in corticobulbar (i.e. cortex to medulla) projection neurons preceding both sensory and memory-guided directional lick bouts. Second, I will obtain electrophysiological recordings (using Neuropixels probes) from pyramidal tract neurons in motor cortex, the superior colliculus, and/or the medullar motor circuits themselves. Finally, I will study the acute and chronic effects of shutting down parts of the brain during licking behavior (using both optogenetic- silencing, and a mouse model of ALS to gradually kill motor neurons). These aims will be pursued at Stanford University, working under the co-mentorship of Karl Deisseroth and Surya Ganguli. This exceptional research community has an outstanding track record of both training postdoctoral fellows and successfully placing them in tenure-track faculty positions. My advisory committee will further ensure that I implement my training plan successfully and am able to establish my own lab to study how global brain computations drive specific actions."
10839337,"Project Summary
Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed and deadliest cancer in the world, accounting for over nearly
one-fifth of all cancer deaths in 2018, and the 5-year survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is
only 18.1%. Given these poor outcomes, new treatment approaches that selectively target cancer cells are
urgently needed. Despite the recent interest in the field of cancer redox metabolism, the link between cancer
redox metabolism and DNA damage repair/signaling as a means by which to enhance tumor cell responses to
radio-chemotherapies remains largely unexplored. My Ph.D. thesis work seeks to exploit inherent differences
in cancer cell NAD+ metabolism to sensitize cancer cells to radio-chemo-therapies. We hypothesize that
selective depletion of NAD(P)(H) in NSCLC cells (versus normal cells) with nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors will confer potent radio-chemo-sensitization by
inducing hydroperoxide-mediated metabolic oxidative stress and/or persistence of cytotoxic PARP-
DNA complexes. My preliminary data supports this hypothesis and, in the remaining F99 phase, a causal link
between the radio-chemo-sensitizing effects of NAMPT inhibition on metabolic oxidative stress and/or
persistent PARP1-DNA complex formation will be established. I will continue by investigating DNA damage
signaling/repair and cancer cell redox metabolism as a post-doctoral researcher studying the relationship
between ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and dysregulated cancer cell redox metabolism with the goal of
enhancing cancer cell responses to radio-chemotherapies. Overall, I believe that this F99/K00 award will
provide the means for me to utilize my skills as a redox biologist in order to establish a research career
focused on the role of cancer cell redox metabolism and DNA damage repair/signaling in tumor cell responses
to radio-chemotherapies."
10833037,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The goals of the research proposed for the MIRA renewal are: (i) to understand the
mechanisms and structures of enzymes that perform nucleic acid synthesis, modification, and repair; and (ii) to
elucidate factors that regulate these events. The project integrates diverse experimental approaches
(microbiology, biochemistry, structural biology, genetics) and applies them to model systems ranging from
viruses to bacteria to fungi. The principal themes are:
(1) The structures, mechanisms, and distinctive specificities of fungal tRNA splicing enzymes Trl1 (tRNA
ligase) and Tpt1 (tRNA 2'-phosphotransferase) – as paradigms of an RNA repair system essential for normal
cell physiology and as promising targets for anti-fungal drug discovery. We will determine structures of Trl1 and
Tpt1 in complexes with nucleic acid and nucleotide substrates and cofactors, and endeavor to capture
structural snapshots of intermediates and transition-states along the reaction pathways.
(2) The structural basis for RNA recognition and strand joining by ATP-dependent 5'-PO4/3'-OH RNA ligase T4
Rnl1. Rnl1 is a tRNA repair enzyme that the T4 bacteriophage uses to evade a tRNA-damaging host response
to virus infection.
(3) The unique catalytic mechanism, end-specificity, and regulation of GTP-dependent 3'-PO4/5'-OH RNA
ligase RtcB. The RtcB-family ligases are found in all phylogenetic domains. They are agents of diverse RNA
transactions, including tRNA splicing (in metazoa and archaea), RNA repair (in bacteria), nonspliceosomal
mRNA splicing (in the metazoan unfolded protein response), and the formation of chimeric RNAs in human
cells that can undergo retrotransposition into the human genome.
(4) Tandem transcriptional interference as a controlling factor in fission yeast phosphate homeostasis. The
three S. pombe PHO regulon genes are repressed in phosphate-replete cells by transcription in cis of 5’-
flanking lncRNAs that interferes with the PHO mRNA promoters. The lncRNA-mediated interference that
underlies the repression of pho1 has afforded us a sensitive read-out of genetic influences on 3'-
processing/termination and a powerful tool for discovery of agents and regulators of this step of the Pol2
transcription cycle. These influences include: (i) the Pol2 CTD code; (ii) numerous components of the 3'-
processing/termination machinery; and (iii) metabolite control by inositol pyrophosphate 1,5-IP8, an intracellular
signaling molecule. We propose to investigate the fission yeast Asp1 kinase/pyrophosphatase enzyme that
determines IP8 dynamics and the cellular proteins and pathways that connect IP8 to gene expression."
10832544,"It has been widely accepted that distinct epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and cancer stem
cell (CSC) properties as well as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) subtype account for the aggressive behavior of this disease. Although increased levels of tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in TNBC predicted better clinical outcome, the majority of these patients display
progressive disease due to the immunosuppressive TME. Although the clinical relevance of TME/pre-metastatic
niche in disease progression has been well recognized, the molecular mechanisms that regulate these
processes remain elusive. Preclinical and clinical data provide compelling evidence that immune cells of myeloid
origin (macrophages, neutrophils, MDSCs) are major components of the TME and predictive of poor prognosis
as well as therapeutic resistance. Therefore, further research is required to understand the underlying molecular
mechanism of formation of immunosuppressive TME/pre-metastatic niche and its role in disease progression
and therapeutic resistance. Our primary objectives in this application are; to determine how stress-induced
HSP70 regulates two fundamental processes; i) protecting tumor cells from cytotoxic cell death by inducing an
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype and ii) generating a permissive
microenvironment via the modulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Our central hypothesis is that A20
induced HSP70 in TNBCs protects tumor cells from cytotoxic cell death while inducing an EMT phenotype and
inflammatory cytokines which in turn promote the accumulation of immunosuppressive MDSCs. Therefore,
targeting HSP70 will have a dual activity on tumors and MDSCs. Our rationale is that the identification of
molecular mechanism(s) that sensitize tumor cells to cytotoxic agents while reversing immunosuppression will
improve the effectiveness of currently available therapeutics. We previously demonstrated that growth of tumors
at metastatic sites is dependent of granulocytic MDSCs and suppression of anti-tumor responses and thus
blocking HSP70 in combination with standard of care and/or checkpoint inhibitors could have significant clinical
benefit. Based on these concepts we propose to test our hypothesis by investigating the following specific aims:
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a reciprocal A20/HSP70 signaling axis provides cytoprotection to tumor cells
by inducing EMT/CSC phenotype in TNBC subtype. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that HSP70 regulates
immunosuppressive MDSC induction and acitivity. Aim 3 will determine the molecular mechanism and functional
importance of HSP70 in generation of TME and pre-metastatic niche. At the completion of our proposal, we
expect to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which HSP70 cytoprotects tumor cells from cytotoxic agents by
inducing EMT/CSC phenotype while regulating the immunosuppressive MDSCs in response tumor secreted
cytokines facilitating the tumor progression. It will also determine whether blocking HSP70 potentiates the
efficacy of the chemotherapies and/or immunotherapy in syngeneic mouse models representing TNBC subtype."
10815583,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements account for approximately 80% of infant acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 35-50% of infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients bearing
rearrangements of the MLL gene are associated with dismal prognosis. To date, no effective therapies have
been approved for treating the fatal diseases. Molecularly, inter-chromosomal translocations of MLL lead to in
frame fusions of the N-terminus of MLL to the C-terminus of various fusion partners, which are known as the
“driver” lesions of the diseases. Among more than 70 MLL fusion partners, a small subset of fusions account for
most leukemogenic cases. In ALL, over 90% MLL rearrangements involve only four fusion partners: AFF1, AF9,
ENL, and AF10, all of which are components of the super elongation complex (SEC) or the complex of the
histone H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L. It is believed that these MLL fusions share a common pathway by
hijacking the SEC or DOT1L complex to promote aberrant activation of the target genes of MLL fusions, leading
to the pathogenesis of leukemias. We and others have recently demonstrated that ENL, a component of the
SEC and DOT1L complex, is critical for the oncogenic function of the MLL-fusions. ENL contains an evolutionally
conserved YEATS domain that we identified as a reader of histone acetylation. We also found that the YEATS
domain of ENL, but not AF9, is essential for growth and survival of the MLL-rearranged leukemic cells. These
key findings strongly suggest that ENL is a promising therapeutic target for MLL-rearranged leukemias. However,
while a recently reported small-molecule inhibitor effectively blocks the interactions between the YEATS domain
of ENL/AF9 and acetylated histone H3, this ENL inhibitor has little or no effect on killing ENL-dependent MLL-
rearranged leukemia cells, failing to phenocopy the cell killing effect of ENL knockout. We hypothesize that
pharmacological degradation of ENL, instead of ENL inhibition that relies on occupancy-driven pharmacology,
will provide a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for treating MLL-rearranged leukemias. To test this
hypothesis, we propose to develop first-in-class ENL small-molecule degraders as in vivo chemical probes using
the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology and evaluate them in MLL-rearranged leukemia cells
and mouse models. We have generated promising preliminary results, suggesting that the proposed research is
feasible. The ENL degrader in vivo chemical probes generated in this project will not only help us test and validate
our therapeutic hypothesis, but can also be further optimized into drug candidates in the future and ultimately
translated in the clinic for MLL-rearranged leukemia patients."
10809034,"Women with disabilities are increasingly becoming pregnant, and may be as likely to become pregnant as
women without disabilities. Growing research suggests pregnancy in women with disability is associated with
an increased risk for adverse perinatal outcomes. Although a few studies have examined disability-related
disparities in adverse birth outcomes, finding increased risk of low birthweight, preterm birth, and neonatal
intensive care unit admission, the mechanisms for these associations are not well understood. One plausible
mechanism is the increased risk of psychosocial stress experienced by women with disabilities in the perinatal
period. Women with disabilities are at heightened risk for intimate partner violence (IPV) and mood disorders,
yet the extent to which these risks affect pregnancy outcomes has not been studied. A more comprehensive
understanding of psychosocial stress, namely IPV and depressive symptomatology, and its relation to adverse
birth outcomes is critically needed to reduce morbidity and mortality rates among disabled mothers and their
infants, reduce disparities in perinatal care between women with and without disabilities, inform the design of
effective evidence-based interventions for this understudied and underserved population of women, and
generate recommendations for clinical practice and policy change. To address this gap, we propose to
systematically examine the association between psychosocial stress and adverse birth outcomes. Using a
mixed method approach, we will: 1) examine the association between psychosocial stress (i.e., perinatal IPV
and depressive symptomatology) and adverse birth outcomes (i.e., low birthweight, preterm birth) by analyzing
data from PRAMS Phase 9 across women with and without disabilities; 2) explore the experiences and barriers
to comprehensive perinatal care through individual interviews with ethnically and racially diverse pregnant and
new mothers with diverse disabilities; and 3) explore facilitators and barriers (e.g., disability-related knowledge,
attitudes, and pregnancy care experience) to the provision of comprehensive perinatal health care to women
with disabilities through focus groups and individual in-depth interviews with health care providers who care for
pregnant women with disabilities with the goal of improving perinatal care for this underserved group of
women. This research will also serve as the foundation for the development and evaluation of future prevention
interventions, including our own team’s planned submission to adapt, tailor, and test existing successful health
promotion interventions to prevent violence and its related sequelae among women with disability, thereby
optimizing pregnancy outcomes for women of childbearing age living with disability."

Paternal mitochondrial elimination and radiation-induced bystander effects are two vitally important, distinct,
and dynamic biological processes essential for animal development, stress response, and organismal fitness.
Defects in these two important processes can cause various pathological conditions and disease. In this
proposed work, we will carry out molecular genetic, reverse genetic, biochemical, cell biological and proteomic
analyses to decipher basic mechanisms that regulate paternal mitochondrial elimination and radiation-induced
bystander effects. For the study of paternal mitochondrial elimination, we hope to understand how paternal
mitochondria are selectively impaired, recognized and removed in fertilized eggs, what paternal and maternal
mechanisms are employed to specifically eliminate paternal mitochondria, and why paternal mitochondria need
to be removed to ensure animal development and cell and organismal fitness. For the study of radiation-
induced bystander effects, we plan to identify factors involved in triggering bystander effects in unexposed
cells, signal pathways that mediate different bystander responses, and the mechanistic basis of bystander
responses to other stresses. These studies should reveal novel mechanisms, pathways, and genes that control
these two fundamental biological processes, and ultimately, provide new targets, ideas, and strategies to
facilitate treatment of numerous human diseases caused by abnormalities in paternal mitochondrial elimination
and improve disease treatment by reducing side effects caused by radiotherapy and other therapeutic
treatments."
10784461,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
CANDIDATE: Dr. James's career objective is to establish an independent research group investigating
mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) and Aminopeptidase N (APN) driven signaling in pulmonary hypertension (PH).
The overall research and career development plan is carefully crafted to impart the necessary skills for Dr. James
to establish a novel and independent line of research. The plan includes the following objectives: 1) gain
additional training in research methodology and professional development; 2) developing strong publication
records; 3) presenting his work at scientific meetings to make an impact on the field 4) obtaining preliminary data
for his first independent grant. ENVIRONMENT: The primary mentor Dr. Rafikov is an expert in mitochondrial
dysfunction and PH. He will provide guidance and technical expertise for aspects in all aims. Co-Mentor Dr.
Vinicio de Jesus Perez is an expert in pericyte biology and PH and will train Dr. James in pericyte isolation, co-
culture, and data analysis. Co-mentor Dr. Ralph Fregosi is an expert electrophysiologist and will extensively
prepare Dr. James in his career development in addition to training with patch clamp techniques. All the mentors
with the rest of the advisory committee will ensure the success of Dr. James's proposal. All the proposed work
will be carried out in Dr. Rafikov's laboratory with training gained from labs of Dr. de Jesus Perez and Dr. Zhiyu
Dai for single cell transcriptomics. Dr. Rafikov has all the necessary funding from NIH and other sources to
support Dr. James during the K99 training phase. The Department of Medicine at the University of Arizona has
excellent facilities and supportive faculty members and provides a nurturing environment for the training phase.
RESEARCH: The overarching hypothesis is that MD triggers the overexpression of the protein, APN in pericytes.
APN has been shown to cause migration, invasion, and proliferation of cells. Preliminary data suggests that MD
in rats triggers an increase in pericyte APN, causing them to dissociate from endothelial cells (EC's) in capillaries,
transform into smooth muscle-like cells (PASMC) and proliferate. This ultimately leads to vascular remodeling
and PH. Three specific aims will address this hypothesis. Aim 1: To Investigate the role of APN in pericyte-EC
communication and pericyte transformation to PASMC. Aim 2: To Investigate the role of MD on APN expression
and signaling. Aim 3: To Verify the impact of blocking APN and reversing MD on vascular remodeling in PH.
The study will utilize several techniques including single cell transcriptomics, 3D imaging and co-culture to
address these questions. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding of how MD drives APN
expression and signaling. This could define novel targets in the treatment of PH for favorable clinical outcomes.
The proposed training will enable Dr. James to acquire new experimental skills and execute his research plan
successfully. This will allow Dr. James to become self-sufficient, able to secure extramural funding and a tenure-
track position at a top-tier research institution."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by both a loss of insulin sensitivity of target and ultimately, impaired
insulin secretion from the pancreatic b-cell. We have identified a novel SWELL1-mediated signaling pathway
that regulates both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion, whereby SWELL1 loss-of-function can both down-
regulate insulin signaling in target tissues, and insulin secretion from the pancreatic b-cell. We have identified a
small molecule modulator, DCPIB (renamed SN-401), as a tool compound that binds the SWELL1-LRRC8
complex and functions as a molecular chaperone to augment SWELL1 expression, plasma membrane trafficking
and signaling. In vivo, SN-401 normalizes glucose tolerance by increasing insulin sensitivity and secretion in
murine T2D models. SN-401 also augments glucose uptake into adipose tissue and myocardium, suppresses
hepatic glucose production in KKAy mice, and protects against hepatic steatosis in HFD fed mice.
We propose that small molecule SWELL1 modulators represent a “first-in-class” therapeutic approach
to treat metabolic syndrome and associated diseases by restoring SWELL1 signaling across multiple
organ system that are dysfunctional in T2D. Combining recent cryo-EM data of SN-401 bound to its target
SWELL1/LRRC8a with molecular docking simulations we have validated a structure-activity relationship (SAR)
based approach to generate novel SN-401 congeners with either enhanced or reduced on-target activity. The
objectives are: 1. To establish the optimal dosing regimen and mode of administration for the newly synthesized,
SAR-inspired SN-401 congeners synthesized to date to achieve a therapeutic effect for T2D; 2. To evaluate for
putative beneficial cardiovascular effects; 3. To determine the primary tissue-site(s) of action of SN-401 in vivo;
4. SAR-based compound synthesis to refine and optimize the leads based on in vitro ADMET and selectivity
screens, and efficacy studies in vivo. We propose the following specific AIMs
AIM#1: Determine optimal dosing regimen, therapeutic effect and target tissue(s) of novel SAR-inspired
SN-401 congeners.
AIM#2: SAR-directed SN-401 optimization and characterization in vitro and in vivo to identify preclinical
lead structures.
This proposal seeks to use a validated chemical biology approach to expand a pipeline of novel,
bioactive pharmacological SWELL1 signaling modulators for the treatment of T2D, metabolic syndrome
and associated diseases to ultimately take into man in the form of a clinical trial for efficacy in humans."
10837007,"Abstract/Project Summary
Vibrio cholerae is a human diarrheal pathogen and an environmental organism that persists in the arthropod
intestine. Our preliminary results suggest that the V. cholerae high cell density quorum sensing regulator
HapR orchestrates the metabolic transition of this microbe from intestinal pathogen to intestinal symbiont by
extending host life span, activating host innate immunity and epithelial repair mechanisms, and promoting host
metabolic homeostasis. Here we use the powerful genetics of the model arthropod Drosophila melanogaster
to understand the lines of communication between host and pathogen that underlie this transition.
We will identify bacterial metabolites that activate host innate immunity and trace the host pathways that are
co-opted by the bacterium for this purpose. We will determine whether the arthropod intestinal mucus or
peritrophic membrane supports growth of V. cholerae and whether digestion by HapR-activated degradative
enzymes activates peritrophic membrane synthesis. Finally, we will explore the role of V. cholerae-derived
tryptophan in promoting host metabolic homeostasis. These studies not only expand our appreciation of the
role of V. cholerae HapR in the host-pathogen interaction but also provide a new paradigm of quorum sensing
control of the host-microbe symbiosis."
10871799,"Objectives: Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in SDHA or SDHB result in SDH-deficiency and
increase the lifetime risk for developing a number of cancers, including GI stromal tumors,
paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma, renal cell carcinoma, and breast cancer. In most cases,
tumors with these mutations arise in the setting of a heterozygous germline mutation, which is
heritable. In patients with a known pathogenic SDHA or B mutation, genetic counseling (to screen
other family members) and enhanced cancer screening procedures are indicated. When SDH-
deficient tumors are detected at early stages, they are often curable. Nonetheless, we currently
do not have the ability to identify patients at risk and screen them appropriately. The main
limitation is our lack of knowledge of the functional consequences of various SDHA or B
mutations; only SDHA or B variants that cause LOF lead to cancer. Germline variants of SDHA
and SDHB are relatively common (1.5% of population), however most are currently classified as
variants of unknown significance (VUS).
Plan: This proposal will generate novel models for functionally testing SDHA and SDHB VUS
seen in the population, including generating human model cell lines and utilizing a deep
mutational scanning approach. Human models, which can provide strong evidence to be used for
clinical classification of variants will be generated and validated for testing individual variants. In
addition, we have established a yeast model that allows functional screening of thousands of
SDHA/B mutations in the yeast homolog genes (ySdh1 and ySdh2, respectively). Using this yeast
model coupled with saturation mutagenesis, functional screening and deep sequencing, the
functional consequences of all SDHA and SDHB missense mutations will be profiled.
Methods: To fill the current void of SDH-deficient cell lines, we will use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate
SDHA- and SDHB-knockout cell lines and validate them to ensure their power for determining
clinical classifications for SDHA and SDHB VUS reported in human tumors (Aim 1). To address
the large number of SDHA and SDHB variants seen in the population, we will create libraries of
all possible ySdh1, (Aim 2) and ySdh2 (Aim 3) amino-acid variants by saturation mutagenesis
and transform these libraries into yeast models deficient in the relevant endogenous yeast protein
(e.g. mutant ySdh1 expressed in ySdh1-deleted yeast). We will select against SDHA/B LOF
variants by growing the libraries under conditions requiring fully functional SDH (glycerol media).
Following deep sequencing, depletion analysis will be performed. Functional interpretations
(functionally normal or LOF) will be made for each variant by comparing calculated effect scores
with those of nonsense/ synonymous controls.
Clinical Relevance: The care of veterans with cancer represents a significant portion of the
overall Veterans Affairs Health Care budget. It is estimated that more than 300,000 US veterans
harbor an SDHA or SDHB germline mutation. Our best chance of a cancer cure lies in early
detection in patients with SDH-deficient tumors, thus the critical medical need lies in classifying
SDHA and SDHB genetic variants to enable identification and subsequent screening of at-risk
patients. Identifying which US Veterans are at risk of developing an SDH-deficient cancer will
allow focused and potentially life-saving genetic counseling and enhanced cancer screening
procedures. The results from our study will also be relevant to non-veteran populations, including
family members of Veterans with pathogenic germline SDHA or SDHB mutations."
10872995,"Gram-negative pathogens producing metallo-β-lactamases, MBLs, are a significant threat to our public health
as treatment options against bacteria possessing these resistance determinants are extremely limited. In
general, MBLs are the most worrisome carbapenemases, inactivating “last resort” β-lactams (e.g., imipenem
and meropenem) and resist all commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors (BLIs). The main challenge in
MBL inhibitor design is exploiting the reaction mechanism as it relates to the structural diversity of the 3 distinct
subclasses (B1, B2, and B3). Based on this approach, our consortium has successfully designed a series of
innovative compounds, bisthiazolidines (BTZs) and thiazolidines (TZs), inspired on a non-β-lactam
“penicillin core” decorated with specific metal binding groups. To date, BTZs and TZs are unique potent, non-
toxic, “cross-class” MBL inhibitors. Recently, we determined the structural basis of their inhibitory action, and
their microbiological activity (bactericidal when combined with a carbapenem). This inspires confidence in the
ability of BTZs and TZs to be effective against MBL producing Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, novel TZs
exhibit similar properties and potencies and in certain cases are superior to BTZs.
The overarching objectives of this project are to embark upon a “high risk-high reward” program in drug
discovery to develop an effective oral MBL inhibitor that is absorbed sufficiently from the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract and can be partnered with an oral carbapenem, tebipenem pivoxil (Tbp-Pvx). We are co-opting an
established strategy, the addition of a pivoxil group, which has been successful in at least two commercial
formulations (cefditoren pivoxil and tebipenem pivoxil) and adapting it to our developmental compounds (BTZs
and TZs). Since parenteral inhibitors for serine carbapenemases are already in clinical use (e.g., avibactam,
relebactam and vaborbactam) and only a few truly MBL inhibitors are in development (QPX7728 and
taniborbactam), our unique and specific formulation will address an unmet medical need, i.e. that of an oral
cross-subclass MBL inhibitor. By the nature of its components, Tbp-Pvx is also intended to be stable
against extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and class C cephalosporinases (AmpCs), which are
resistance determinants often present in MBL-producing strains. Additionally, we will mitigate the problems
associated with cephalosporins (resistance selection). As a lead compound, we have identified a potent BTZ (L
syn CS319) that effectively lowers MICs to within the susceptible range when paired with a carbapenem. As an
alternative, we have also synthesized potent TZ derivatives. We propose to develop the first oral
carbapenem and MBL inhibitor formulation to be considered for development that overcomes difficult to
treat carbapenem resistant infections mediated by MBLs. Our experimental evaluations stem from close
partnership with scientists in Argentina and Uruguay and will involve a closer collaboration with the Wound
Infections Department (WID) and the Experimental Therapeutics (ET) Branch of the Walter Reed Army
Institute of Research (WRAIR) via the Geneva Foundation. After establishing “proof of concept” in the murine
thigh infection model, the ultimate clinical applications will be in skin and soft tissue, and bone and joint
infections. These are clear priorities for the Veterans Health Administration and the US Military."
10824444,"Experimental evidences indicate that many aspects of mammalian retinal physiology and function are
under the control of a retinal circadian clock. Studies also indicate the retinal molecular clock and its
output signals contribute to retinal disease and pathology. Bmal1 is a key component of the circadian
molecular circadian clock mechanism. Our previous studies indicate that the removal of Bmal1 from
retina modulates neural circuitry of retina and cone photoreceptors viability. The goal of the present
proposal is to investigate the role of retinal circadian clock in retinal function and SCN
circadian organization. The present application comprises three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we
will investigate the mechanism underlying clock regulation of cone viability using 661W cell line. In
specific aim 2, we determine whether the environmental circadian disruption (ECD, e.g. jet lag)
affects retinal function and circuitry. In specific aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that the removal of
Bmal1 from retina alters circadian behavior rhythm. In our research, we will use a wide array of new
and technologically advanced techniques as well as several lines of transgenic mice and cell line will
be used. Our proposal will provide important insights into the role of circadian clock in the modulation
of visual function, photoreceptors viability and behavior rhythm."

This proposal encompasses two very different aspects of microbiology, both at cellular and group levels. (1)
Probing E. coli genome organization and chromosome dynamics using phage Mu transposition as our tool. Mu
transposition is unique not only in its high efficiency and lack of target specificity, but also in its transposition
mechanism, which occurs by a nick-join rather than a cut-and-paste pathway. In the last grant period, we
exploited these properties to measure in vivo rates of interactions between genomic loci in E. coli, and studied
their proximity using new statistical tools. In a complete reversal of the current view of the E. coli genome,
our analysis has revealed an uncompartmentalized, well-mixed genome, where transpositions occur freely
between all measured loci. The analysis also revealed that several gene families (for example, six widely
distributed ribosomal RNA operons) show `clustering' i.e. strong 3D co-localization regardless of linear
genomic distance. The activities of the SMC/condensin complex MukBEF and the nucleoid-compacting protein
HU-α are responsible for these properties. We propose to explore these phenomena to obtain a high-
resolution view of genome organization, and to understand how it influences gene expression in bacteria. (2)
Dissecting the mechanism of antibiotic tolerance under two specific growth conditions: swarming (moving as a
collective), and c-di-GMP synthesis catalyzed by the diguanulate cyclase YfiN. Swarming bacteria can
withstand exposure to antibiotics at concentrations that are lethal to their planktonic counterparts. We call this
swarming-specific (non-genetic) resistance, SR. In the last grant period, we discovered that death of a sub-
population as a result of antibiotic-induced killing, is beneficial to the swarm in promoting SR. Introduction of
pre-killed cells into a swarm indeed enhanced SR, allowing us to purify the SR factor from killed cells of both E.
coli and Salmonella. We identified the SR factor to be AcrA, a periplasmic component of a tripartite RND efflux
pump; the outer membrane component of this pump, TolC, is also a constituent of multiple drug efflux pumps.
We showed that AcrA stimulates drug efflux in live cells by interacting with TolC from the outside, activating
efflux in the short term, and inducing the expression of other classes of efflux pumps in the long term, thus
amplifying the response and establishing SR. We have called this phenomenon `necrosignaling', and
discovered species-specific necrosignaling in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We also
discovered that production of c-di-GMP by the specific cyclase YfiN, arrests cell growth to promote an
antibiotic-tolerant persister-like state. We propose to explore both these responses further. Given that non-
genetic resistance is a known incubator for evolving genetic resistance, our findings are relevant to the current
widespread emergence of genetic resistance to antibiotics, and may be relevant to chemotherapy-resistant
cancers, which efflux the drugs prior to acquisition of genetic resistance."
10832619,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease that is increasing in prevalence with the aging
population, characterized by the accumulation of Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide associated plaques and
hyperphosphorylated tau protein associated neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). This proposal seeks to link a known
feature of aging, namely impaired thermoregulation and lower body and brain temperature, with this age-related
increase in NFT pathology. Older age is associated with a long (10–20 year) preclinical phase before symptom
onset, in which Aβ and NFT pathology increases and can be measured with tau PET and plasma markers.
Extensive and compelling preclinical (rodent and in vitro) findings show that tau phosphorylation is strongly
potentiated by small decreases in temperature (decreases in molecular kinetic energy), owing to the differing
dependence of regulatory kinases and phosphatases upon this property. Other molecular processes that cause
NFT formation may be similarly temperature dependent. We will build upon the results of our preliminary study
in older adults that was motivated by these preclinical findings, providing, to our knowledge, their first human
translation. Our preliminary results showed that lower telemetrically measured body temperature (Tb) during the
hours the subject was awake – but not during sleep – strongly predicted (R2 = 0.47, p < 0.005) the amount of tau
NFT tangles measured with [18-F]-MK-6240 tau PET-MR in early Braak stage areas in cognitively normal (NL)
older adults. The purpose of the current project is to verify this strong relationship between lower waking Tb and
NFTs, using the same methods, in a larger sample of older adults (n = 100, 50 female, 60–80 years) who are
NL or have mild cognitive impairment. Briefly, subjects will undergo medical screening (Visit 1), followed by 7
days of home actigraphy for sleep-wake cycle characterization and further screening, and neuropsychological
evaluation in Visit 2. In Visit 3, to take place over 48 hours, subjects will undergo Tb measurement with ingestible
telemetric thermometry over 48 hours, simultaneous with two nights of nocturnal polysomnography to integrate
Tb with the sleep wake state and measure slow wave sleep, followed by plasma tau and p-tau sampling the
following morning. Subjects will be free to return home during the day in between sleep studies. At Visit 4, 18-
F]-MK-6240 tau and amyloid PiB PET-MR scanning will be completed. We aim to 1)Verify lower waking Tb
prediction of NFT in this sample, 2)Incorporate and account for the effects of Aβ plaque load (known to increase
NFTs) and older age into the model, and 3)Test the extent to which the known relationship between Tb and sleep
plays a role in Tb–NFT associations. This cross-sectional study will lay the ground work for future prospective
studies to determine whether Tb based interventions can prevent the progression of NFT pathology toward
reducing Alzheimer’s Disease burden."
10824350,"Project Summary/Abstract
Impaired placental function leads to dangerous pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia, intrauterine
growth restriction, placental abruption, and stillbirth. Placental dysfunction is the leading cause of maternal,
fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide and predisposes offspring to higher risks of developing
cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, and stroke during
adulthood. To improve human health, it is imperative to elucidate the mechanisms causing impaired placental
development. The chemokine, CXCL12 (L12) regulates several processes central to the development of the
placenta (placentation) such as stimulating cell proliferation and migration, vascularization, immune cell
recruitment and cytokine production through direct actions on fetal trophoblast and maternal endometrial and
immune cells. These essential functions are elicited via L12 activating its two receptors, CXCR4 (R4) and/or
CXCR7 (R7); however, the contributions of R4 compared to R7 during placentation remain unclear, denoting a
substantial gap in knowledge. Our group and others demonstrated L12-mediated signaling is strongly
implicated in placental dysfunction and specifically preeclampsia etiology. Defining L12-induced actions
through its two receptors may reveal underlying mechanisms causing placental dysfunction. We developed an
innovative animal model to study L12-dependent signaling at the fetal (trophoblast)-maternal (endometrial)
interface by delivering treatments directly into the uterus. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate
disrupting L12-mediated signaling during the small window of embryo implantation diminishes placental
vascularization, induces autophagy, and creates an excessive inflammatory placental environment later in
gestation. Notably, several observed outcomes mirror those of placental dysfunction, suggesting an imbalance
in L12/R4/R7 signaling may be causative. Preliminary data indicate transitory suppression of L12/R4 signaling
induces lasting placental insufficiency with preeclampsia markers VEGF receptor-1 (sFLT-1) and placental
growth factor (PlGF) remaining elevated months later, at midgestation. Whether excessive R7 activation
contributes to these findings when R4 is suppressed remains uncertain. Our data underscore the importance
of L12 during placentation and provide strong evidence that altering L12-mediated signaling induces enduring
placental effects manifesting later in gestation. Nevertheless, we lack a clear understanding of how L12,
excreted by fetal trophoblast cells, signals through R4 and R7 on trophoblast and maternal cells. This SC1 will
test the overall hypothesize that L12 induces distinct biological responses through R4 versus R7, thereby
differentially impacting placental development, function, and fetal growth. Results from Aim 1 will provide new
scientific knowledge on R4 and R7 functions in placental biology during times impractical to obtain in humans
through characterizing a robust in vivo model and placental phenotype at select gestational times. Mechanistic
in vitro studies in Aim 2 will delineate L12-mediated signaling in fetal and maternal cells."

During this past R01 funding period, we have mapped causal effects within the MHC region to
specific HLA-DR binding groove amino acid sites, identified >100 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) non-
MHC risk alleles across the genome, and have demonstrated that these alleles are largely
within CD4+ T cell regulatory elements. If we could define the genetic mechanisms
underpinning RA susceptibility, then it may be possible to define therapeutic strategies to
abrogate or prevent RA. Central to this is defining the key T cells involved in mediating disease
susceptibility – both in terms of their unique TCR sequence features and their pathogenic cell
states. Here, we hypothesize that HLA-DR risk alleles act within the thymus to favor selection of
“sentinel TCRs”, and that when autoantigens are presented to sentinel TCRs, risk alleles within
T cell enhancers alter T cell specific gene regulation, which enables naïve T cells expressing
sentinel TCRs to transition into a pathogenic state. We define “sentinel TCRs” as those
receptors that bind to citrullinated peptides and trigger the initial autoimmune response. Risk
alleles in T cell promoters and enhancers alter regulation of critical T cell genes that regulate the
transition of T cells into pathogenic states. Hence, a T cell with a rare “sentinel TCR” can, under
the right conditions, trigger the initial autoimmune response, drive a spreading immune
response, and initiate persistent joint inflammation. But, the key pathogenic T cell states,
sentinel TCRs, and the action of specific causal regulatory T cell alleles are not yet fully defined.
Repertoire sequencing to define TCR sequences in blood and tissue, single cell analyses to
resolve T cell states, and genetic engineering to interrogate causal T cell alleles and genes
represent exciting methodologies that our lab has developed expertise in. In this proposal we
seek to build support for this model. First, we will demonstrate that HLA class II HLA RA risk
alleles alter TCR repertoire to harbor “sentinel TCRs”, using TCR and genotype data from 300
healthy individuals. Next, we will use polygenic RA risk models to define the key T cell states
that RA risk alleles influence with single cell data on surface markers and transcripts in the
same 300 individuals. Finally, we will define the molecular mechanisms of non-coding alleles
using genomic editing in CD4+ T cells; to this end we will develop and apply strategies to edit
primary T cells, sequence DNA to confirm the presence of the desired edit, and obtain RNA and
ATAC sequencing data to understand the impact of the edit and confirm the functionality of non-
coding alleles."
10612950,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite more than 40 RCT interventional trials in pregnant women at risk for delivering large-for-gestational age
(LGA) infants, there is currently no clearly effective treatment to reduce fetal overgrowth in overweight/obesity
(OW/OB), which account for ~70% of pregnancies. Maternal obesity remains the most common cause of LGA
infants and increased fat mass at birth, the latter a stronger harbinger for the development of childhood metabolic
disease. One in five preschoolers is already obese, and 40% already exhibit non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), suggesting early life adipogenic influences. We have shown that newborns from mothers with obesity
and gestational diabetes are born with 68% more liver fat than those from normal-weight (NW) mothers, and
earlier maternal TG, before subcutaneous fat stores have developed, predicted newborn liver fat. Non-human
primate data support that liver fat at birth predicts later NAFLD. Our data show that under controlled conditions,
OB mothers have 30-40% higher fasting and postprandial triglycerides (FTG, PPTG) throughout pregnancy.
Moreover, FTG and PPTG are more predictive of newborn fat than glucose, BMI or fat mass, insulin resistance,
or weight gain. Although maternal PPTG independently predicted 50% of the variance in newborn fat early (14
wks), by later pregnancy (28 wks) this effect was augmented by glucose. This suggests that rising glucose later
in pregnancy stimulates fetal insulin (cord C-peptide), and when combined with excess TG availability, augments
newborn fat storage. Although some data support TG in fetal overgrowth, TG are not measured as part of routine
obstetric practice. In part, this is due to prior unavailability of a portable TG meter (similar to a glucometer) that
allows repeated testing, which we have now successfully piloted. In this prospective cohort trial in OW/OB
pregnancies we will, for the first time, obtain repeated measures of TG and glucose (by CGM) to define: 1) at
what level of TG the risk of fetal overgrowth increases, and if this occurs independent of or in synergy with
glucose; 2) when in pregnancy the TG exposure is most important, 3) if fasting vs postprandial TG results in
greater newborn subcutaneous fat (Specific Aim 1; by air-displacement plethysmography) or in newborn liver
fat (Specific Aim 2; by magnetic resonance spectroscopy), independent of other risk factors and accounting for
sex differences. In our Exploratory Aim, we will interrogate mechanisms by which placental lipid transport
pathways may facilitate fetal fatty acid (FA) delivery, the lipidomic signatures of maternal and cord blood which
correspond with increased fetal fat accretion, and the adipogenic potential of umbilical mesenchymal stem cells.
Completion of this community-based trial may provide compelling evidence to support a paradigm shift in
obstetric practice that endorses meter TG monitoring, similar to glucometers in gestational diabetes, for mothers
at risk for fetal overgrowth. Clinically impactful, these data may inform a future interventional trial in which TG
are targeted with safe TG-lowering agents (i.e., high dose omega 3-FA supplements) to prevent excess newborn
subcutaneous and liver fat, with the goal of decreasing childhood risk for obesity, NAFLD, and metabolic disease."
10819473,"Axon guidance is the study of how developing nerves navigate in response to external
signals. A remarkably small number of navigational signals have been identified, raising
the question of how the complexity of the brain is generated. One solution is that a single
ligand can signal in different ways either through the presence of different receptors or
through processing that alters receptor binding. Slit is a large secreted protein that
typically repels growing axons using Robo receptors. Slit is cleaved into two fragments,
Slit-N and Slit-C, which display new biological activities in the nervous system and that in
many other tissues. However, the role of the Slit fragments is controversial. The Slit-N
fragment contains the Robo binding site and has been shown to be repel axons in in
vitro culture systems and so is thought to be the active signaling molecule. Multiple lines
of in vivo preliminary evidence in Drosophila suggest that only the full-length (Slit-FL)
protein repels axons. This proposal takes an in vivo molecular genetic approach in flies
and mice to separate the signaling of Slit-FL from that of the Slit fragments.These two
systems will allow us to address the effects of Slit on axon growth, axon branching and
regulated adhesion (fasciculation). This work will allow us to determine how a single
signal can achieve different biological outcomes. The proposed work has implications for
a diverse range of fields, including infectious disease, cancer and nerve regeneration."

ABSTRACT - Profiling and Mapping Core B
Modern infectious disease research relies fundamentally on genomic maps of the major pathogens. With the
recent development of whole-organism metabolomics profiling tools, comprehensively mapping the M.
tuberculosis (Mtb) metabolome is now feasible. Core B supports mass spectrometry-based profiling of Mtb
metabolites to support Projects 1, 2 and 3 that focus on discovery, drugs and diagnostics, respectively. The
Core will carry out whole-organism lipidomic and metabolomic profiling, archive datasets and use modern
bioinformatic methods to generate metabo-lipidomic maps of Mtb. Maps are comprised of a structured listing
of all metabolite subclasses, a list of all named metabolites within each class, and links of all named
metabolites to mass values and other biological variables. We previously generated the MycoMap Database,
which is the largest existing map of 183 mycobacterial metabolite classes linked to ~195,000 accurate mass
values. We will now expand the database by adding newly discovered lipids generated in Projects 1, 2 and 3.
Supporting Projects 1 and 2, we will solve the Mycolate Outer Membrane Lipid Map, which describes
compounds located at the host-pathogen barrier and involved in drug penetration. Supporting Projects 1 and 3,
the core will measure metabolite variation among Mtb strains from South African patients to generate the
Human Mtb Strain Lipid Variation Database. This database will describe the prevalence and variation of lipids
among strains circulating in human communities to identify lipids under control by host selection and to support
diagnostics development."

Core Leader: Adriaan Minnaard
ABSTRACT
The Chemical Synthesis Core C supports chemical discovery and benchmarking experiments in ways that
cannot be achieved by analysis natural bacterial products. Whereas natural compounds from pathogenic
mycobacteria are generally limited to microgram yields, chemical synthesis can provide many milligrams to
durably supply large-scale experiments. Whereas natural products typically show many nearly co-eluting
molecular variants, synthesis can produce a single pure compound for benchmarking natural compounds and
as a standard for rigorously confirming newly discovered chemical structures. Synthesis of analogs with
defined chemical variations supports determination of structure-activity relationships. Core C is housed at the
Stratingh Institute at the University of Groningen, a world leading center for synthetic chemistry in a laboratory
that specializes in enantiospecific catalytic methods of chemical synthesis. Thus, Core C has a unique
expertise in production of bacterial metabolites with multiple chiral centers that define complex branched chain
structures, such as phthiocerol dimycocerosate, sulfoglycolipids, mycolic acid, phenolic glycolipid and other
lipids. Core C will produce milligram quantities of mycobacterial metabolites to support Projects 1 and 3. In
addition, the Core will provide both existing and new compounds to generate a comprehensive set of
standards for benchmarking mycobacterial lipids in the Profiling and Mapping Core B."

ABSTRACT
Understanding the mechanisms through which Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) metabolites impact human
tuberculosis (TB) disease requires implementation of model animal systems that are both tractable and
faithfully replicate the TB disease states observed in humans. Here we propose to leverage the Collaborative
Cross (CC), a genetically diverse panel of recombinant inbred mice that can be reproducibly and indefinitely
regenerated. We have previously shown that the CC panel encompasses a broad spectrum of TB disease
traits and infection microenvironments. CC mice provide a tractable model in which to study specific Mtb
genetic-metabolite pairs, compared to standard inbred mice that show limited phenotypic variability. For
example, in a genome-wide TnSeq experiment, we found that among 19 high value Mtb metabolic genes, only
one controlled growth in the conventional C57BL/6J (BL6) mouse strain. However, more than half of mutants
studied showed in vivo growth phenotypes when screened across CC mouse strains. Further, through study of
the host genetic backgrounds in which individual bacterial genes do or do not control in vivo Mtb survival, the
Smith laboratory can begin to study host factors in control of Mtb response. The Animal Core E will conduct
experimental infection approaches to support Projects 1 and 3 that focus on virulence associated lipids and
diagnostics, respectively. To support identification of Mtb metabolites as diagnostic tests in Project 3, we will
characterize lungs and serum from mice infected with a high and low burden of Mtb. Supporting efforts to
understand the role of host pressure on the mycobacterial envelope content in Project 1, we will produce Mtb
strains passaged in vivo in mice. Extending our existing Tnseq approach to identify mycobacterial genes that
control Mtb growth in vivo, we will select and test up 50 pooled Mtb CRISPR knockdown strains for pulmonary
infection in CC strains. From these, five Mtb CRISPR knockdown strains with the strongest in vivo growth
phenotypes will be further studied in detail as single gene knockdowns to determine their specific functions."

Project Leader: D. Branch Moody

ABSTRACT
Comparative genomics has served as a dominant paradigm for tracking the tuberculosis (TB) epidemic,
understanding Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) virulence and developing new drugs and diagnostics.
Mycobacterial metabolism, in contrast, has been viewed as invariant feature of all clinical Mtb strains. Through
comparative metabolomic profiling of ~10,000 lipids among 84 patient-derived Mtb strains, we discovered that
Mtb’s pathognomonic lipid envelope shows identifiable patterns of variance among strains circulating among
human populations. To determine the impact of phenotypic diversity within the infecting bacterial population,
we will map cell wall lipid variation among 140 Mtb strains among TB patients from Masiphulemele, South
Africa. The resulting lipid map will describe variations in lipid composition among Mtb strains transmitting in
community. From a biological perspective, Mtb’s lipid envelope forms the primary interface with the host and is
therefore a direct and ongoing biochemical target of evolutionary selection. This project aims to reveal the
previously undescribed chemical diversity and lipid products that have arisen as a consequence of host- and
drug-derived clinical pressure. Using organism wide lipid profiling and genome wide sequencing, we have
identified 42 lipid-gene pairs that dominate in Mtb strain variance, as well as 1150 lipid species overexpressed
in virulent Mtb and 250 lipids selectively expressed at the host interface. Preliminary data support our ability to
then link these lipids to specific bacterial genes, even when prior to knowledge of the metabolite’s structure or
a gene’s function is lacking. CRISPR interference strategies will then establish causal linkages between genes
of unknown function and newly discovered lipids. We will further test lipid deficient strains in collaborative cross
mice to reveal specific roles of newly identified lipids in Mtb virulence. These discovery studies will identify
biologically important lipids that determine key outcomes in virulence, the host interface and Mtb survival in
vivo, supporting new approaches for tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment."

The goal of the program is to provide training in computational methods development in genomics and related
areas to researchers at the graduate student or postdoctoral level as well as provide exposure of the
participants to faculty from multiple institutions with the goal of providing opportunities for career transitions
(graduate student to postdoc and postdoc to faculty). While there are plenty of short courses that provide
training in how to use computational methods to analyze data, very few exist to provide training on how to
develop such methods and our program will fill this need. With more and more types of data becoming
available in large quantities, the ability to develop new and adapt existing methods in innovative ways is a
critical skill for a successful researcher. Our program is useful for those trainee researchers whose career
focus is computational methods development, but will also be useful for those researchers who want to add a
methods development component to their research program. Our program will consist of a one month summer
program at the University of California, Los Angeles integrated with a year round mentoring program building
upon relationships that are established during the one month program. An outreach program is integrated into

10817071,"Project Summary/Abstract
 We have developed a technique for randomizing 23S ribosomal RNA structure, and for selecting modified
ribosomes which incorporate into proteins specific types of modified amino acids not ordinarily incorporated by
wild-type ribosomes. Species incorporated both in vitro and in vivo have included nucleobase amino acids,
dipeptides/dipeptidomimetics, beta-amino acids, phosphorylated amino acids and glycosylated amino acids.
 The selected ribosomes enable study of two key biochemical regulatory processes, i.e. protein glycosylation
and phosphorylation. We will also modify regulatory proteins that interact with nucleic acids, enabling
predictable modulation or altered specificity of interactions. We will exemplify new strategies using proteins
containing unusual non-proteinogenic amino acids, whose incorporation requires our selected ribosomes.
 The creation of proteins phosphorylated stoichiometrically at single or multiple positions affords new
opportunities. These include the ability to verify natural phosphorylations, and to study their effects. It permits
the introduction of (metabolically stable) phosphate groups in vivo, and has enabled new strategies for
identifying residues whose phosphorylation modifies function. We showed that phosphorylation of IB- Tyr42
not only relaxes NF-B inhibition, but facilitates the rate of binding to a gene whose expression NF-B
regulates. We plan to study two other known phosphorylation sites in IB-, and three in NF-BWhile some
sites of serine phosphorylation in NF-B are known, this is not true for Tyr and Thr. Using a new strategy, we
have identified four sites of Tyr phosphorylation, and plan to study new Thr and Ser phosphorylation sites.
 Most mammalian proteins are glycosylated, but understanding/altering carbohydrate functions is challenging.
Using a selected ribosome in a cell free system, we prepared murine interferon- (IFN-) containing GlcNAc-
Asn at position 29, which can confer antiviral activity. This intermediate acceptor substrate should enable
carbohydrate cluster transfer, producing IFN- fully glycosylated at position 29, and expected to have antiviral
activity. We have recently introduced the same glycosylated amino acid, and its peracetylated analogue, into a
model protein in very good yield in cellulo. This strategy can potentially produce the same intermediate as that
prepared in vitro, but in much larger quantities. We wish to prepare fully glycosylated proteins with natural
carbohydrate clusters, to simplify these clusters, and to focus on the inclusion of residues such as sialic acid.
 Cell regulation often involves protein–DNA interactions; low nanomolar affinities and impressive selectivity
are typical. Many X-ray crystal structures could guide design changes, but attempts to alter these regulatory
processes by changing affinity or specificity have failed. Using Rob proteins having nucleobase amino acids,
we modified binding to their micF DNA partners, realizing stronger binding, and enhanced phenotypic cellular
responses. We propose to study the Rob–micF DNA interactions further to refine our design techniques. The
principles developed will be used to address protein–DNA recognition in a Zn finger system."
10815722,"Project Summary / Abstract
Recent research has established that epigenetic information inherited from the father has an impact on the
physiology of his children, and that this information varies depending on environmental exposure and
metabolic status of the father. There is also now a substantial body of evidence that paternally inherited
epigenetic information may contribute to childhood obesity and other significant public health problems,
depending on paternal diet. Mechanistic insights are still scarce, however, and it remains unclear which dietary
factors may be able to modify epigenetic programming of sperm in a way that affects metabolism in the
offspring. Addressing this important problem, this project will test the central hypothesis that reduced paternal
metabolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels result in heritable sperm-borne epimodifications
that modulate offspring metabolism. NAD+ is a central molecule involved in energy metabolism and it also
serves as a substrate of epigenetic regulators such as sirtuins, including histone deacetylases, and poly(ADP-
ribose) polymerases involved in sperm epigenetic programming and the regulation of energy metabolism.
Vitamin B3 (niacin, nicotinamide) is the main dietary precursor of NAD+ synthesis in humans. This project
proposes to utilize an innovative transgenic mouse model of acquired niacin deficiency (ANDY) that permits for
the first time to study effects of low NAD+ levels, as seen in parts of the human population, in a laboratory
animal. Our preliminary data show that suboptimal levels of NAD+ in ANDY males resulted in progeny with
smaller body size, altered insulin sensitivity, and altered carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, which indicates
that the micronutrient niacin may be of previously unrecognized importance for epigenetic programming of
sperm. The objectives of the proposed work are (1) to characterize the metabolism of NAD+-deficient males
and their F1 progeny, where we expect to identify heritable adaptations of energy metabolism that depend on
paternal nutritional status, (2) to test the hypothesis that low NAD+ levels in males result in elevated sperm
histone acetylation and differential sperm histone positioning, which are expected to include metabolic genes
whose regulation is affected in F1 progeny, and (3) to determine the nature and extent of altered gene
expression profiles in F1 progeny. We further propose to determine the extent to which pharmacological
intervention, e.g. supplementation therapy, can prevent such changes.
 We expect that DNA methylation levels will be altered in gene loci in offspring as a consequence of
abnormal sperm histone acetylation in NAD+-deficient sires. In summary, the proposed studies are expected to
establish NAD+ as a molecular link between paternal nutrition and metabolic state, sperm chromatin-mediated
epigenetic inheritance, and the regulation of offspring metabolism, including metabolic disease. The expected
results should be relevant for the future development of avoidance and periconceptional nutritional
supplementation strategies for men with the goal to maximize chances that children are born healthy."
10832516,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Iatrogenic nerve injury represents one of the most feared surgical complications and remains a major morbidity
across all surgical specialties. Nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy is a compelling clinical example of significant
patient morbidity, where nerve damage is reported in up to 60% of patients resulting in incontinence and impo-
tence. Surprisingly, no clinically approved technology can enhance intraoperative nerve visualization, typically
performed through neuroanatomical knowledge and conventional white light visualization alone. Development
of a near infrared (NIR) fluorophore that specifically highlights nerve tissue in the operating room would have
direct clinical translation to nerve sparing prostatectomy through the FDA approved fluorescence channel in the
da Vinci surgical robotic system (Firefly, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.), which is used in >80% of prostatectomies per-
formed in the United States today. The proposed work will directly address this unmet clinical need. Fluorescence
Guided Surgery (FGS) has successfully integrated into clinical medicine with only two FDA-approved NIR fluor-
ophores (i.e., indocyanine green [ICG] and methylene blue). FGS systems operate almost exclusively in the NIR
(700-900 nm), where tissue chromophore absorbance, autofluorescence and scatter fall to local minima, allowing
high contrast and high resolution imaging at up to centimeter depths. All clinical FGS systems have an “800 nm”
channel designed to image ICG. To facilitate rapid clinical translation, the overall goal herein is to generate a
nerve-specific small molecule fluorophore with spectral properties matched to ICG, enabling both nerve imaging
at depth and future clinical translation using existing clinical FGS infrastructure. Design and development of a
small molecule nerve-specific fluorophore that can be imaged using FGS systems optimized for ICG has been
a significant challenge because these probes need to have a low enough molecular weight to cross the tight
blood nerve barrier junction with a sufficient degree of conjugation for NIR excitation and emission. In exciting
preliminary work, our team has synthesized first-in-class NIR nerve-specific small molecule fluorophores that
can be imaged with standard FGS systems optimized for ICG. Herein, these novel probes will be synthetically
tuned and validated for clinical utility through translation to swine and canine models using the da Vinci as well
as completion of preclinical pharmacology and toxicology (pharm/tox) studies, enabling a future IND application
to the FDA for clinical translation to robotic assisted radical prostatectomies (RARP). This goal will be accom-
plished through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Synthetic tuning and characterization of NIR nerve-specific
fluorophores for future clinical FGS. Aim 2: Demonstrate compatibility with the da Vinci Firefly and preclinical
pharm/tox suitable for clinical translation. Aim 3: Select the optimal 800 nm, nerve-specific fluorophore for future
clinical translation to guide nerve-sparing RARP. Successful completion of this R01 will result in an optimal NIR
nerve-specific fluorophore suitable for use with all clinical FGS systems and validation of nerve-specific contrast
for RARP using the da Vinci Firefly."

The Brain Immunology ang Glia Training Program (BIGTP) at the University of Virginia (UVA) will build on
existing strengths in neuroimmunology and glia research and the programming that has been in place since the
establishment of the center from Brain Immmunolgy and Glia (BIG) in 2012. The BIGTP brings together 20
mentors from eight different departments with the goal of providing interdisciplinary training that sparks
discoveries and prepares a generation of researchers that are uniquely equipped to tackle research questions
that arise at the interface of neuroscience and immunology. Funds are requested to support two predoctoral
trainees each year for a duration of two years, typically in years three and four of graduate training. The 20
mentors are well-funded by a total of nearly $11 million in annual direct costs. The average mentor has trained
more than nine pre- and postdoctoral trainees in the past ten years. Assistant Professors are included as Junior
Mentors that will require senior BIGTP faculty to serve as co-mentors for trainees. Formal mentor training is
required of all BIGTP mentors. Trainees will partake in the dynamic BIG research in progress seminars that are
held weekly. Trainees will also have access to leaders in the field through the BIG Neuro seminar series. Annual
retreats will focus on trainee development, review of the program, and will allow trainees to interact with members
of the BIGTP External Advisory Board that are invited as keynote speakers. The quantitative literacy of trainees
will be developed and supported through the Quantitative Literacy Series designed specifically for trainees that
addresses topics in experimental design, reproducibility, power analysis, statistical analyses, transparency in
reporting, etc. Importantly, Dr. Marieke Jones directs required courses in programming and statistical analyses
and will be directly supported by and involved in BIGTP events, providing continuity in instruction and support
for trainees for the duration of their predoctoral studies. The BIGTP will be evaluated by current and past trainees,
program mentors, and members of a highly-qualified External Advisory Board. Predoctoral trainees trained in
BIGTP mentor laboratories have completed their degrees in approximately 5.25 years and contributed to an
average of 4.9 publications and 1.7 first-author publications in journals that include: Nature, Cell, Nature
Neuroscience, Science Translational Medicine, Immunity, Neuron, PNAS, Science Advances, and Nature
Communications. Current and past trainees have been supported by individual fellowships sponsored by NIH,
NSF, and UVA. Importantly, 97% of trainees remain in science-related fields and 74% go on to complete further
training. The BIGTP leadership and mentors understand the importance of diversity, which is essential for the
strength and growth of the proposed Training Program. The BIGTP’s commitment to diversity is demonstrated
by the inclusivity within the Program’s administration and programmatic events. The implementation of an NIH-
sponsored T32 training program will allow existing strengths and programming at UVA to strengthen and expand
to provide unparalleled training for predoctoral trainees in a burgeoning research area."

BrightSpec, Inc.
Project Summary
This project proposes to develop a new analyte sampling technique for Molecular Rotational
Resonance (MRR) spectrometers for the volatilization of solid phase analytes. The proposed
system, Laser Induced Acoustic Desorption (LIAD), will enable a large number of important
compounds to be accessible by MRR, enhancing our understanding in several important areas of
research and accelerating pharmaceutical development. The resulting expansion of sampling
range and corresponding utility of this valuable technique will greatly accelerate the adoption of
MRR in important areas of research and development.
MRR is a spectroscopic technique for unambiguous structure determination and quantitation of
small molecules, which has been used for decades in academic research laboratories, but only
recently commercialized after the recent achievement of several groundbreaking innovations.
MRR excels in structural and isomeric analysis, providing a detail of information like nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), but at a much lower cost and faster speed, with reduced method
development. Through working on a final piece of the puzzle, the development of new sampling
techniques, BrightSpec seeks to unlock the full analytical potential of this powerful analytical
technique to broaden its use throughout a range of applications, including metabolomics, drug
discovery, natural product analysis, and the monitoring of environmental pollutants.
BrightSpec has evaluated several sampling techniques for volatilization of solid samples and Laser
Induced Acoustic Desorption (LIAD) was determined to be uniquely suitable for incorporation
with MRR, as the sensitivity of results with these instruments can be adversely affected by the
presence of solvents. BrightSpec has evaluated several sampling techniques for volatilization of

A proof-of-concept prototype LIAD-MRR instrument has been used to demonstrate the viability
of coupling the two techniques. This preliminary work has de-risked this proposed Phase II project,

speed, and ease-of-use to facilitate commercial adoption. The resulting product will then be tested
thoroughly on relevant samples in market areas where LIAD-MRR is expected to have the greatest
impact. Several prospective customer use cases and samples have already been identified.
Following this extensive evaluation, the product design will be refined for commercial launch at
or before the end of the grant period."

The parafascicular nucleus is a major nucleus in the so-called intralaminar group. Although it is
traditionally considered part of the reticular activating system and thought to play a role in
arousal and attention, its contributions to behavior are still poorly understood. Much of the work
on the Pf was done in primates before the development of modern intersectional strategies for
selective cell type targeting and neural circuit dissection. This proposal aims to elucidate the
computational functions of specific components of the Pf circuit, and to determine how this
circuit can be used for the control of attention and action selection. Preliminary results indicate
that the Pf plays a key role in rapid action generation, which appears to be mediated by direct
excitatory inputs from the deep/intermediate layers of the superior colliculus. Two populations
of Pf projection neurons target different downstream structures and have distinct behavioral
functions. We hypothesize that Pf projections to the subthalamic nucleus are especially
important for fast action initiation that bypasses the canonical basal ganglia circuitry, where as
the well-known Pf projections to the striatum is not needed for action initiation, suggesting that
the Pf-basal ganglia pathway has a distinct function. A highly integrative approach will be
employed, combining 1) Motion capture for continuous behavioral quantification in 3D; 2)
wireless in vivo recording from single neurons; 3) optogenetic manipulation of defined neuronal
populations; 4) 1-photon calcium imaging of genetically defined individual neurons; and 5)
quantitative operant behavioral assays. These tools will be used to determine how the Pf
processes inputs from the midbrain and uses this information to guide action selection via
distinct output projections to the STN and striatum."
10830298,"We propose to harness the synaptogenic potential of Sema4D signaling to increase
GABAergic synapse number, thus enhancing inhibition in neural circuits and suppressing
seizures. This approach could be beneficial to preventing the establishment of epilepsy, halting
its progression, or suppressing hyperexcitability during a seizure event.
 Previously our lab discovered that the extracellular domain of transmembrane protein
Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) drives inhibitory synapse formation on a remarkably fast time scale
(i.e. minutes) in hippocampal neurons and slice cultured from the pre-natal and neonatal
hippocampus. We also demonstrated that intra-hippocampal infusion of purified, Sema4D
extracellular domain into the adult hippocampus rapidly promotes the formation of new
GABAergic synapses. Further, we reported that Sema4D treatment protects against seizures
induced by electrical stimulation of the dentate gyrus or by intravenous infusion of the
proconvulsant drug pentylenetetrazol.
 Given the success of these studies, we undertook a new experimental direction to
determine if Sema4D treatment has therapeutic potential for human epilepsies. The first aim of
this proposal is to investigate Sema4D treatment as an acute, anti-seizure therapeutic in rodent
models of status epilepticus (SE). SE is a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention
in humans; approximately 30% of patients with SE are refractory to treatment with current
medications including benzodiazepines. Preliminary data presented in this proposal shows that
Sema4D treatment restored the efficacy of diazepam in a rodent model of refractory SE. This
result is consistent with our hypothesis that Sema4D treatment acutely increases the number of
GABAergic synapses in hippocampus, which maintains or re-establishes benzodiazepine
sensitivity in the brain.
 The second aim of our proposal is to determine the effect of chronic exposure of
Sema4D (via viral delivery to the CNS) on inhibitory synapse formation and ultimately, seizure
frequency and severity in rodent models of chronic epilepsy. As a first step towards this goal we
will explore the efficacy and time-course of alternative methods of administering Sema4D (e.g.
intracerebral injection of virus encoding Sema4D) to mice. In the third aim, we will begin to
address the translatability of our findings with Sema4D in rodents by asking if Sema4D
promotes inhibitory synapse formation and network activity in cultures of human neurons."
10735888,"ABSTRACT
The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) microbes has been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as global threats to human health and safety. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics conjoined with natural evolution has now put us in a situation where conventional antibiotics are no longer effective. To address this global crisis, new molecules to combat AMR microbes must be developed. Unfortunately, significant gaps in conventional screening approaches have prevented the efficient discovery of desired novel antibacterial or host­ dependent anti-infective (HDAI) therapeutics. This proposal will pursue the development of an innovation that enables the simultaneous screening of compounds with antimicrobial and/or HDAI therapeutic activities, thereby dramatically enhancing the target space for thwarting AMR bacteria. Specifically, a novel microfluidic system called GUARD (a Global Unbiased Antimicrobial Recovery and Discovery platform), which supports the high­ throughput, low-cost screening of environmental microbes that produce natural products (NP) that either directly kill pathogens, or that activate host HDAI activities, has been prototyped. Notably, the GUARD system will perform these assays at single-cell (digital) resolution. The goal of this project is to further develop and utilize GUARD to identify new classes of molecules that either directly kill or prevent infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as well as multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which have been categorized as the highest global priority (i.e., ""critical"") by the WHO. In addition, this project will discern their mechanisms of action. With these ideas in mind, this proposal aims: Aim 1: To develop the GUARD platform and utilize it to screen more than 108 microbes from diverse habitats to identify isolates that synthesize NPs that (a) kill multidrug resistant A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, and MRSA or induce HDAI activities that protect host cells, and (b) are non-toxic to host cells; Aim 2: To utilize sequencing and state­ of-the-art analytical chemical dereplication, lead prioritization, and small molecule purification strategies to identify novel NP scaffolds with desirable profiles; Aim 3: To evaluate the spectrum of pathogens targeted by the most promising NP antimicrobials and/or HDAIs, and the host targets of our most promising HDAI NPs. Important outcomes of this work will be the development and implementation of a novel platform and workflow for the discovery of molecules that defeat AMR microbes, and the delivery of several novel NPs that can be advanced for further pre-clinical testing and clinical evaluation."
10899423,"Abstract: More than one million cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) are diagnosed annually
in the US and approximately 4% of patients develop metastases and 2% die of cSCC; thus, a similar number
of people die each year from cSCC as melanoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are a new class of drugs
that have transformed the therapy of multiple cancer types, but only half of cSCC patients respond to ICI
treatment. ICI target receptors on T cells, such as PD-1, that are expressed after activation and function to turn
off T cell responses. The response of cSCC patients to ICI demonstrates the ability of T cells to constrain
cSCC growth. However, it remains unclear the extent to which CD8 and, in particular, CD4 T cells contribute to
immune-mediated control of cSCC. While the focus of anti-tumor T cell responses has been on MHC class I
neoantigens that elicit cytotoxic CD8 T cell responses, there is growing evidence that MHC class II
neoantigens eliciting CD4 T cell responses are critical in constraining tumor growth and enhancing response to
ICI. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the role of CD8 and CD4 T cells, especially the role of
neoantigen-specific T cells, in controlling cSCC growth. We generated a novel physiologic cSCC
transplantable model on the BALB/c background from a solar simulated light-induced invasive cSCC tumor.
Preliminary data supports that T cells constrain the in vivo tumor growth in the cSCC model and that this model
is sensitive to anti-PD-1 treatment. Using bioinformatic approaches with whole exome and RNA sequencing
data, we have identified immunogenic MHC class I and II neoantigens predicted to elicit a T cell response
based on the binding affinity and presentation of the neoantigen:MHC complex and neoantigen expression.
Using melanoma patient data, our lab has previously demonstrated that these characteristics accurately
predict the ability of a neoantigen to elicit a T cell response. The central hypothesis is that both neoantigen-
specific CD8 and CD4 T cells contribute to immune-mediated control of cSCC growth and response to
treatment with vaccination with immunogenic neoantigens alone or in combination with anti-PD-1. To address
this hypothesis, we will determine the role of CD8 and CD4 T cells in controlling tumor growth, identify MHC
class I and II neoantigens that elicit in vivo T cell responses, and evaluate the expression of functional and
inhibitory neoantigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells throughout cSCC tumor growth. Then, we will vaccinate
mice with dendritic cells loaded with irradiated tumor cells or immunogenic MHC class I and/or II neoantigens
and compare the efficacy of these vaccination strategies in inducing CD8 and/or CD4 T cells to prevent cSCC
growth and treat cSCC alone or in combination with anti-PD-1. We will demonstrate the requirement for CD8
and/or CD4 T cells through antibody depletion and adoptive transfer. The impact of this project is to 1) identify
the contributions of neoantigen-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells in control of cSCC growth and 2) advance the
application of personalized neoantigen vaccines to treat cSCC alone or in combination with anti-PD-1."

application. At the core of both training opportunities are the leading experts in oral microbiology, dental
materials, and tissue regeneration. We have expanded the breadth of opportunities by creating a second
research track to include community dentistry and nutrition. We have established an internship in Southwestern
Oregon for learners who would not otherwise be available to spend a summer in Portland due to the distance.
Summer interns will be welcomed into these rich laboratory and community environments. We have partnered
with the state of Oregon's community leaders in rural health and in diversity to attract a robust cohort of applicants
representing under-represented minorities and nontraditional learners. We have identified peer mentors from our
current DMD Student Research Group to provide direction during the summer. And, we have a strong Leadership
and Advisory Team who are themselves diverse and passionate about mentoring undergraduate research. While
several excellent programs already exist for internships in biomedical research at OHSU to recruit
undergraduates, OHSU currently lacks a mechanism to recruit learners specifically interested in dental, oral and
craniofacial research. The DORS will establish partnerships with existing biomedical training programs at OHSU
and Portland State University and build our cohort in dental, oral and craniofacial research. Success of this
application will lead to increasing the number of dental scientists in the state of Oregon and the number of diverse
dental scientists by providing them a strong summer research program early in their careers."

Human hepacivirus or hepatitis C virus (HCV) establishes chronic hepatotropic infection in ~70% of infected
individuals. In this project, the central question is: Can we mutate a hepacivirus genome to generate an
attenuated virus to use as a vaccine? Serial passaging of pathogenic viruses in vitro or in vivo biological systems
followed by the selection of less-pathogenic viral strains is the traditional way to generate an attenuated virus
vaccine. HCV attenuation remained inconceivable since an efficient cell culture system was unavailable for
decades after virus discovery, and an animal model is still elusive. Similarly, for many other chronic human
viruses, their species specificity restricts the development of immunocompetent animal models critical for
meaningful studies of immunity and pathogenesis. This project will use a rodent hepacivirus (RHV) that shares
the hallmarks of HCV infection in humans. We will use a bioinformatics approach to alter the dinucleotide
frequencies in RHV genomes to generate attenuated variants. Our preliminary results provided a solid
rationale for the project and assured its feasibility. We determined that the RHV variant with high frequencies
of UpA (uracil followed by adenine) failed to develop a chronic infection in rats. We propose two aims to refine
our strategy of generating attenuated hepaciviruses and characterize the innate and adaptive immunity
induced by their infection. Aim-1 is to optimize the design of the hepacivirus mutants that produce high-titer
viremia and fail to develop chronic infection. Aim-2 is to characterize the innate and adaptive immunity
induced by attenuated hepacivirus mutants. Since we will use a sequence-independent approach (only
synonymous mutations) to attenuate RHV, the results can inform the design of an HCV vaccine. Additionally,
successful attenuation of a chronic virus in its natural host will open new research avenues and yield new viral
variants to define immune responses associated with viral clearance and persistence and immune correlates of
protection for chronic viruses."

 Interoception, the sensing of signals from internal organs, is crucial to achieving homeostasis in
unpredictable environments. For instance, appropriate food intake relies on accurate estimation of future
energy balance, which in turn relies on gastrointestinal (GI) signals like nutrient content or stomach stretch. A
key brain area that assesses visceral state is the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) in the brainstem. Visceral
information is routed to the LPBN by several convergent pathways, including the nucleus of the solitary tract
(NTS), which relays signals from vagal afferents to LPBN. Despite this anatomical roadmap, we lack a
comprehensive picture of the functional architecture and GI sensory preferences in the LPBN and its NTS
inputs. This information is crucial to understanding how representations of body signals associated
with fasted, fed, and feeding states are formed, and how they regulate energy balance. To address this
gap in knowledge, I propose to assess the functional organization of GI representations and their relation to
natural feeding. I will further test if specific NTS cell types mediate the relay of these visceral signals to the
LPBN. I will accomplish these aims with a novel method of two-photon imaging in the hindbrain that tracks
hundreds of LPBN neurons across days. In Aim 1, I will measure visceral sensory preferences in the LPBN in
response to mechanical stimulation and nutrient delivery across regions of the GI tract. These measurements
will allow me to determine the spatial organization of LPBN, including testing the presence of a viscerotopic
map of internal organs. Next, I will relate these recordings to activity in the LPBN during ingestion, visceral
malaise, and across fasted and fed states. I will test the hypothesis that a wave of neural activation in LPBN
across many seconds during natural feeding tracks a putative map of the GI tract. In Aim 2, I will determine
how specific inputs from the NTS contribute to feeding-related and satiety state-related activity in LPBN.
Specifically, I will repeat the stimuli of Aim 1 while recording from calcitonin receptor-expressing (Calcr)
neurons of the NTS that have been shown to signal physiological satiety. I will measure when individual axons
of these inputs to LPBN (CalcrNTS->PBN) are active, as well as record LPBN responses to the above stimuli while
CalcrNTS->PBN axons are silenced. These experiments will demonstrate how a key pathway relays GI state and
other satiety information to the LPBN to regulate behavior and interoception. The proposed research will lay
the groundwork for understanding how interoceptive signals from the GI tract lead to satiety sensations,
influence feeding behaviors, and ultimately regulate energy balance. This knowledge will pave the way for
future efforts combining in vivo imaging with spatial transcriptomics to identify specific cell types and
subregions within the LPBN as therapeutic targets for obesity and other metabolic disorders."

We propose updating, piloting and testing a socialization and sex education curriculum (STEPS-2) designed
for adolescents and young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD). We will test this
updated curriculum in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 856 adolescents and young adults (aged 18-
27 years) with mild to moderate I/DD who receive services from disability providers in four of the five
Developmental Disabilities Regions of the New York State Office for People with Developmental Disabilities.
Randomization will be stratified by region, sex (male/female) and age (18-22, 23-27). Half of the participants
will be randomized to receive the updated STEPS-2 socialization and sex education curriculum in
individualized sessions during home visits, and the other half will receive a group-based intervention on
physical exercise and nutrition in a local community center; only one roommate will be eligible to be enrolled
from any group living arrangement to minimize spillover effects. Regional Coordinat ors will provide the 6-week
long interventions, with interview data collected at baseline (prior to intervention), month 2 (completion of
intervention), month 6 and month 12. We project completing recruitment into the RCT during the second
quarter of year 3, and completion of month 12 assessments in the third quarter of year 4. The primary outcome
will be proportion of participants reporting having had a conversation about sex/reproductive health with a
medical provider by month 12, with secondary outcomes including HPV vaccination status, receipt of sex and
age-specific preventive health screening, social sexual behaviors, agency over decisions, and, among those
sexually active, use of contraception (if not desiring a pregnancy), and use of sexually transmitted infection/HIV
protection. Interim measures will be used to assess knowledge and to reduce the likelihood of recall bias for
the primary endpoint.
Specifically, we aim to: (1) Update and pilot an existing socialization and sex education curriculum (STEPS-2)
for 18-27 year olds with I/DD in New York State through a participatory process centering the voices of diverse
lived experiences; (2) Test the efficacy of this socialization and sex education curriculum in a randomized
intervention trial using intention-to-treat and instrumental variable analyses to adjust for compliance. We
hypothesize that at least an additional 10% of the individuals in the experimental group will have had a
reproductive health discussion with a medical provider by month 12 compared with the control group; and (3)
Test whether the efficacy of the intervention differs by sex and age in stratified analyses. We have powered the
study for sex-specific efficacy estimates and will explore whether efficacy differs by age. The findings from this
translational study will inform practitioners, advocates, and self-advocates about best practices for reproductive
and sexual health education for adolescents and young adults with I/DD as they transition to adulthood."

 Studies have revealed the exciting promise of CRIPSR/Cas genome editing to excise provirus for HIV cure.
However, a major barrier to their clinical application is how to deliver it to latently infected cells effectively and
specifically in vivo. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a new lentivirus-like
particle fusogenic resicle (LVLP-R) that will specifically deliver multiplexed Cas12a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and
mRNA via MS2 coat protein (MCP) to CD4-expressing cells in vivo for excision of HIV proviruses and coreceptor
CCR5. This CD4-targeted LVLP-R (LVLP-R-CD4) will deliver Cas12a protein/mRNA and multiplexed guide
RNAs (gRNAs) with an increased excision efficiency and reduced off-target potential due to lack of lentiviral
reverse transcription and integration. We hypothesize that LVLP-R-CD4 with Cas12a RNP/mRNA can
simultaneously excise HIV proviral DNA and CCR5 in vivo. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data
and pre-existing reports on successful RNP/mRNA LVLP delivery and multiplex genome editing in vivo. In Aim
I, we will optimize our established VSVG-pseudotyped LVLP-R (LVLP-R-V) delivery of Cas12a RNP/mRNA both
in vitro and in vivo for HIV proviral and CCR5 excision. In Aim II, we will develop and optimize DARPin or HIV
Env-mediated LVLP-R-CD4 that efficiently delivers Cas12a RNP/mRNA to human CD4 T cells for genome
editing in vitro and in vivo. In Aim III, we will evaluate HIV proviral and CCR5 excision for an HIV cure using
LVLP-R-CD4 delivery of multiplexed Cas12a RNP/mRNA in HIV-infected ART-suppressed humanized-BLT mice.
We focus on targeting CD4 T cells as our primary test platform because (1) our group was the first to apply
CRISPR/Cas genome editing to excise HIV proviral DNA in T cell; (2) CD4 T cells are the major latent reservoir
cells of HIV infection; and (3) the research team in this proposal has extensive expertise in studying lentiviral
delivery and HIV infection of CD4 T cells using various approaches, including the humanized-mouse model.
This high-reward proposal will explore a new LVLP-R-CD4 delivery of advantaged LbCas12a RNP/mRNA to
CD4 cells and excise HIV provirus and CCR5 as a novel cure strategy. Completion of the proposed studies will
offer a novel tool to deliver genome editors to CD4 cells in vivo and may provide a new gene therapy approach
to HIV and other T cell-related diseases."

Mitochondria created an evolutionary advantage for eukaryote and metazoan organization, and their impact on
cell biology extends from anabolic and catabolic metabolism to determining the final moments of cell survival by
engaging apoptosis. Throughout the last decade, interest in studying how mitochondria influence cancer cell
biology led our laboratories to identify mechanisms linking oncogenic signaling (i.e., BRAFV600E / NRASG12V ) to
multiple mitochondria-centric processes within malignant cells including altered mitochondrial dynamics,
oxidative phosphorylation, and chemosensitivity. More recently, we focused on exploring how oncogenes
intersect upon mitochondrial biology prior to transformation – which will likely provide molecular details into pre-
malignant cell biology and early stages of disease. We commonly position our studies in the context of melanoma
as we have extensive experience with primary human melanocytes, integrated cohorts of patient RNA-seq
datasets and tissues, and multiple in vitro and in vivo models of early and late disease. For instance, the
introduction of oncogenic signaling (BRAFV600E / NRASG12/Q60) in primary human melanocytes causes rapid
oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), and this tumor-suppressive mechanism is reflected in patients who
present with pre-malignant skin lesions in the clinic. Therefore, the scientific premise for this application is based
on three novel observations: (i) primary human melanocytes expressing oncogenes rapidly expand their
mitochondrial networks during OIS; (ii) this expansion is dictated by the undescribed activation of the ATF5-
dependent mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR); and (iii) the mtUPR controls the rate and extent of
OIS. While the mtUPR is a fundamental organelle-specific quality control signaling pathway that is essential to
mitigate mitochondrial stress, no literature mechanistically connects oncogenic signaling to mtUPR activation,
melanocyte biology, nor melanoma progression. In our preliminary experiments, we explored biochemical
signaling, mitochondrial responses, cellular gain-of-function / loss-of-function approaches, and hundreds of
patient samples to establish the hypothesis that the oncogene-activated ATF5-dependent mtUPR is a key
signaling pathway that instructs melanocytes during OIS and its escape. In this R01 application, we propose
three complimentary, but distinct, specific aims to examine this hypothesis using melanocytes, numerous models
of early disease, and patient samples. Specific Aim #1: Interrogate the mechanistic relationship between
oncogenic signaling, mtUPR, and OIS. Specific Aim #2: Identify the gene expression programs mediated and
maintained by the mtUPR during OIS and early disease primary melanoma. Specific Aim #3: Define the impact
of mtUPR activation in models of nevi and primary disease."

The optics of the eye suffer from imperfections (wavefront aberrations) that blur retinal images. This blur limits
our ability to diagnose eye disease before irreversible damage and vision loss take place. Adaptive optics (AO)
ophthalmoscopy can correct for this blur, which is unique to each eye and retinal location. Current AO
ophthalmoscopes can only capture images of very small retinal areas because they cannot correct for the
variation of the wavefront aberrations across the retina. This limitation impedes the use of this technology for
detecting early signs of disease, which in turn, enable the early treatment that would mitigate irreversible vision
loss. Here we propose to first measure how wavefront aberrations change across the retina in a human subject
population to improve the design and operation of all future AO ophthalmoscopes. We also propose two novel
methods for measuring and correcting wavefront aberrations that vary across the retina to increase the field of
view of these instruments. First, we propose to measure aberrations sequentially at various points in the field of
view and then deliver appropriate sequential wavefront corrections at each retinal location. This low-cost, low
complexity approach could be used to double the retinal coverage of current AO scanning ophthalmoscopes.
The second approach uses two wavefront correctors, the optimal axial positions of which will be determined by
using the data on wavefront aberration changes with retinal location and wavelength across the population. This
more complex approach aims to at least quadruple retinal coverage. The resulting increase in the field of view
will be a major step towards translating AO ophthalmoscopy into a practical clinical tool for improving the
diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases."

Food banks and food pantries are critical community-based institutions for addressing food insecurity, which is
associated with obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. The effectiveness and efficiency
of food assistance programs are constrained by many factors, including: recruitment and training of of
staff/volunteers; meeting client needs for acceptable, healthy choices; and providing real-time information for
planning and emergency operations. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated all of these problems and
continues to do so. The effective management of food pantries, before, during, and after the pandemic, is a top
priority as resources are limited, communications are often decentralized, and the in-house ability to adapt
practices to an online setting is nearly non-existent. As well, pantry volunteers, commonly older adults, are
both the main support staff at food pantries and the most at risk for severe COVID-19 health effects. Based on
substantial preliminary data and more than two decades of experience working to improve Baltimore’s food
system, this NHLBI Clinical Trial Pilot Study will develop and pilot a working mobile Support Application for
Food PAntrieS (SAFPAS) application (app) to address these challenges. No such app that offers capabilities
for staff/volunteer recruitment, training, and scheduling; nutrition education and messaging with clients; a safe
form of client choice; and/or bidirectional communications for emergency preparedness and response currently
exists. Our formative research with Baltimore food pantry and Maryland Food Bank personnel found high
enthusiasm for an app that combines these features, as did our recent national survey of food pantry directors.
This study will develop and pilot the app, and evaluate its feasibility and impact on food pantry staff emergency
preparedness, stocking, and client uptake of healthful foods and beverages in Baltimore, with the following
aims: 1) to develop and optimize a technically stable, functional app to improve food pantry services in
Baltimore; 2) to pilot the SAFPAS app with Baltimore-based food pantries and clients, the Maryland Food
Bank, and Baltimore’s Emergency Operations Center team, and assess its feasibility; and 3) to evaluate the
impact of SAFPAS on the healthiness of foods received by food pantry clients in a sample of 360 low-income
urban clients (at baseline), drawn from 20 pantries measured pre- and post-intervention in a randomized
controlled pilot trial. Findings will allow us to: 1) produce a functional and acceptable app; 2) provide
preliminary data for power calculations for a future full-scale trial; 3) generate and refine impact and process
evaluation instruments and set standards for implementation; and 4) establish protocols and demonstrate our
ability to recruit and retain food pantries and food pantry clients. We will assess potential scalability of the app
by conducting formative and feasibility assessments with food pantry staff and clients in Detroit. The findings
from this R34 study will support a full-scale clinical trial that will test a multi-city deployment of the SAFPAS app
and assess its impact on food pantry client health outcomes, diet, and food security."

Aging is a risk factor for many diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative
diseases, with the incidence of such diseases peaking between ages 60 and 80. Although both the cellular
and the extracellular components of a tissue change with age, current preclinical models have focused on
the aging-related changes in cells and overlooked the alterations in the microenvironment, specifically the
extracellular matrix (ECM), which is one of the main reasons for the low success rate of pre-clinical to
clinical translation. Thus, it is imperative to create disease models that mimic the aging microenvironment
to better study disease initiation and progression, as well as reliably test for drug efficacy. Here, as a
proof-of-concept aging-associated disease, for the first time in literature, we propose to engineer
decellularized aged human ECM (dECM)-based 3D tumor models and implant them into immunodeficient
mice to create hybrid mouse models to study the effect of matrix age on tumor progression and drug
response. We will follow a bottom-up approach to establish the hybrid mouse model; first we will engineer
the aging stroma using aged human breast dECM and aged human stromal cells both derived from
healthy donors, then grow aged patient-derived tumor organoids on the stroma to engineer the 3D in vitro
tumor models, and finally implant the 3D tumors into immunodeficient mice to create the hybrid mouse
models. Hence, we aim to establish reliable and human representative preclinical models, 3D tumor
models and hybrid mouse models, which allow us to distinguish the individual and combined effect of
aging components (i.e. ECM, stromal cells, and tumor cells) on tumor initiation and progression. We will
then mechanistically test the individual effects of aged ECM characteristics, such as the altered stiffness,
fiber structure and biochemical composition on tumor progression. The proposed work aims at solving
many problems of the current preclinical models. First, we will produce in vitro and in vivo preclinical
models that consider the effect of aging human ECM on cancer progression. Second, by creating hybrid
models, we will address the lack of systemic response in the 3D models, and the lack of control and
inability to discern the effects of individual components in in vivo models. Finally, we will create tumors in
mice that better represent the human response and benchmark our hybrid model with actual patient
samples.
To achieve these goals, we will combine our expertise in tissue engineering, mouse model systems,
transcriptomics, primary cell culture model systems, and breast cancer research. Once fully implemented
and functionally validated, we expect our state-of-the-art tissue engineered 3D disease models as well as
the hybrid mouse models to serve as the next-generation research platform for both basic and
translational cancer research and high-throughput drug discovery."

As a major hub of the central auditory system for hearing, the inferior colliculus (IC) receives both
bottom-up input from auditory brainstem nuclei, as well as feed-back input from the auditory cortex (AC).
IC contributes importantly to the processing of essential features of sounds for communication and
localization. Impaired IC processing has been associated with various hearing deficits. However,
despite extensive studies of central auditory processing in IC, our understanding of cell-type-specific
circuit mechanisms underlying the functional roles of the IC remains limited. In particular, how different
types of neurons in the three anatomical and functional subdivisions of IC, the central nucleus (ICc),
dorsal cortex (ICd), and external cortex (ICe), interact with each other and contribute differentially to the
auditory processing of IC remains largely unclear. Addressing this question requires identification of
molecular markers for cell types specifically located in each of the subdivisions. With 10X Genomics
single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq), we made initial efforts in screening molecular markers
for different neuronal populations of IC. By identifying and verifying specific markers for IC subdivisions
and exploiting corresponding transgenic Cre mouse lines for the selected marker genes, we will then
characterize the anatomical connections and auditory response properties of the selected cell type and
its functional role in auditory processing functions. Our preliminary snRNAseq results suggest two
potential molecular markers specifically labeling subpopulations of excitatory neurons in the IC cortex.
Their verification will endow us with unique opportunities to investigate the specific and diverse
functional roles of ICd in auditory perception and behavior. Cutting-edge approaches in
electrophysiology, anatomy, and optogenetics coupled with intersectional or projection-based tagging
will be applied to address the differential functional contribution of diverse neuronal types in ICd as well
as the distinct underlying circuitry mechanisms."

Retinal neurons utilize multiple antagonistic mechanisms to shape visual signal processing, such as ON and
OFF signaling, antagonistic center-surround, rod- and cone-signaling, and transient and sustained signaling.
Among those signaling mechanisms, ON vs. OFF signaling is coded to morphologically distinct groups of
retinal neurons, bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells. Retinal neurons that ramify in the inner region of the
inner plexiform layer (IPL) respond to the onset of a light stimulus, called ON cells. In contrast, OFF cells
ramify in the outer region of the IPL and respond to the offset of a light stimulus. Since being discovered
several decades ago, there appeared to be no exceptions to this morpho-physiological rule for ON and OFF
signaling. However, recently, some exceptions have been revealed. We found that ON and OFF signaling
switches in starburst amacrine cells and bipolar cells. We also found that light adaptation plays a crucial role in
the ON and OFF sign switch. In the mesopic light condition, both rods and cones are active, generating a
complicated interaction. However, light-evoked responses in retinal interneurons, including bipolar and
amacrine cells, have not been systematically investigated over a wide range of ambient light levels. In our
proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that the rod-cone interaction in the mesopic condition converts
the ON and OFF signs of light responses in retinal bipolar cells and amacrine cells. The long-term goal of the
proposed study is to examine how the ON and OFF sign switch occurs in the interneuron and how this plays a
role in shaping spikes in ganglion cells. We will use wholemount retinal preparations to conduct a patch clamp
study of bipolar and amacrine cells to determine the visual signal signs in response to various light stimuli.
Especially, we will assess the light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (L-EPSPs) over a wide range of
background light conditions. We will also examine the L-EPSPs at the mesopic condition after the tissue is
adapted to scotopic or photopic conditions (Aim 1). Also, we will determine how retinal antagonistic signaling
systems shape the ON and OFF signs. We will test potential underlying mechanisms, including the rod-cone
signaling interaction, the dopaminergic system, the antagonistic surround by inhibitory amacrine cells, and the
ON-OFF signaling pathway interaction (Aim 2). Then, we will examine the outcome of the switch by conducting
the Calcium imaging from the starburst amacrine cells (Aim 3). Understanding the mesopic vision is essential
because both rod and cone dysfunction cause reduced vision in the mesopic vision."

 Chronic gastritis initiates a pathological progression of disease which in some individuals culminates in
gastric cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. Helicobacter pylori infection is the
most common cause of gastritis and responsible for most gastric cancer cases worldwide. Autoimmune gastritis
is another prominent cause of gastritis increasing the risk of gastric cancer development. Persistent gastric
inflammation initiates the transformation of healthy epithelial cells into pre-cancerous metaplastic cells which
transform into adenocarcinoma in a subset of individuals. Recent transcriptomic analyses of gastric
adenocarcinoma have led to the identification of four distinct molecular subtypes. This discovery has improved
targeted treatment and surveillance strategies for each distinct gastric cancer subtype. Currently, there is a need
for an in-depth molecular analysis of pre-cancerous gastric metaplasia. We recently discovered that gastric
metaplasia can also take on distinct molecular phenotypes in the autoimmune setting. It needs to be determined
whether metaplasia arising out of H. pylori infection, known to inject cytotoxins that can interfere with cell-
signaling pathways possibly promoting oncogenic transformation, is phenotypically distinct from metaplasia
arising out of autoimmune gastritis. If metaplastic subtypes are conserved, then chronic inflammatory signals,
independent of etiology, likely contribute to cancer progression; however, if metaplastic subtypes in infection are
distinct from autoimmunity, then factors unique to the bacterial infection likely drive an alternative trajectory of
oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, how certain inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-4/IL-13) impact the
development of gastric metaplasia and specific molecular subtypes of metaplasia needs to be established.
Identifying molecular phenotypes of pre-cancerous metaplastic cells, in distinct disease settings, that may carry
differential oncogenic potentials, will contribute to the discovery of novel screening targets to decrease the gastric
cancer burden in highly susceptible individuals. Identifying the inflammatory signals that promote the
development of potentially high-risk metaplastic cells will aid in discovery of new therapeutic strategies for
inhibiting gastric cancer.
 In this proposal, metaplasia arising out of two common etiologies of gastritis, H. pylori infection and
autoimmune gastritis, will be molecularly defined and compared. Gastric metaplasia from human gastritis
patients will be transcriptionally profiled to determine the phenotypes of metaplasia induced by human disease.
The impact of inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13, on inducing/expanding phenotypically distinct subtypes of
gastric metaplasia will also be determined. This work will improve the mechanistic understanding of gastric
carcinogenesis in the settings of H. pylori infection and autoimmune gastritis. This knowledge can then be used
to improve medical prevention strategies and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention of gastric cancer."

PTEN is highly associated with autism, macrocephaly, and congenital hydrocephalus, which are increasingly
prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders that present in early childhood. Currently, there are no treatments that
address the cause of these conditions, despite mounting genetic evidence through large scale whole exome
sequencing studies that mutations in specific genes, including PTEN, confer increased risk for these disorders.
While these studies produce compelling targets for investigation, the role of PTEN in neurodevelopmental disorders
remains poorly understood. We seek to understand how PTEN, through its role as a negative regulator of the
greater mTOR pathway, contributes to early neurodevelopment using CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function models
in zebrafish. We have generated zebrafish mutants with frameshift mutations in exon 5 of both pten alleles present
in the teleost duplicated genome: ptena (Δ10) and ptenb (Δ2). We first aim to characterize neurodevelopmental
abnormalities in these fish, which preliminary data indicates have significant differences in brain volume, brain
activity, brain ventricle size, and startle response. We will further explore the function of PTEN in regulating cell
proliferation, differentiation, and establishment of the excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the brain. Secondly, we aim
to use this model to provide a new and accessible tool for screening the PTEN variants identified in children with
neurodevelopmental disorders, by injecting embryos with human mRNA constructs at the 1-cell stage and
evaluating neurodevelopmental changes. Lastly, we will perform a high-throughput drug screen of mTOR pathway
inhibitors and additional compounds which oppose or match the behavioral changes observed in our mutant larvae.
This will identify new potential pharmacological candidates. Our preliminary data already shows partial phenotype
rescue upon treatment with mTORC1-inhibitor sirolimus. In summary, these loss of function lines demonstrate
PTEN plays a critical role in early vertebrate neurodevelopment. Furthermore, these models provide a new and
accessible tool for screening the PTEN variants identified in neurodevelopmental disorders as well as potential
pharmacological candidates."

Over 50 million Americans experience chronic pain annually, which has led to increases in opioid prescription
rates. While effective analgesics, opioids produce harmful side effects like euphoria and physical dependence,
which has led to a nationwide opioid epidemic and a need for efficacious analgesics that lack harmful side
effects. Understanding how opioids impact the nervous system is important to distinguish the neural circuits
driving opioid analgesia from circuits underlying unwanted side effects. Opioids target the mu opioid receptor
(MOR), an inhibitory G-protein coupled receptor expressed by neurons throughout the brain. Neurons in the
periaqueductal gray (PAG) express high levels of MOR and, upon electrical or morphine stimulation, produce
both analgesic and rewarding behaviors. Distinguishing opioid-dependent PAG circuits driving analgesia from
rewarding circuits may reveal a powerful, non-addictive therapy for pain relief. Characterizing the composition
and organizational connectivity of the PAG is necessary to target distinct opioid-dependent circuits. PAG
neurons vary in function, location, and molecular composition, but have not been comprehensively
characterized using single-cell approaches. The PAG relays sensory and affective information to and from
various brain structures during opioid use, but the configuration of presynaptic inputs and projection targets of
opioid-sensitive MOR+ PAG neurons is unknown. Understanding the composition and organization of opioid-
sensitive neural circuits is important to discern where opioids act to produce analgesic and rewarding effects.
In preliminary single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) experiments I identified 14 PAG transcriptionally
distinct neuron subtypes that expressed various levels of the gene encoding MOR (Oprm1). In Aim 1, I will use
spatial transcriptomics to determine the distribution and cellular heterogeneity of Oprm1+ PAG neurons. I will
then resolve the architecture of opioid-sensitive circuits in the PAG using input-output circuit mapping. In Aim
2, I will first determine whether PAG neurons can be genetically classified based on their projection target
using retro-seq. I will also use inhibitory chemogenetics during sensory, affective, and motivational behavior
assays to investigate whether PAG neurons with different projection targets contribute to specific opioid-
induced behaviors. The combined molecular, spatial, and circuit data generated from these experiments will
provide a means to manipulate specific PAG circuits and reveal which neurons are receptive to opioids.
Furthermore, results from loss-of-function behavioral assays will demonstrate whether specific PAG circuits
preferentially contribute to the sensory or affective effects of opioids. The proposed research will be conducted
under the mentorship of Dr. Gregory Scherrer. Dr. Scherrer has extensive experience integrating mouse
genetics, functional neuroanatomy, and complex behavioral assays to investigate the neural circuits underlying
opioid behaviors. Collectively, this project will help me develop into an independent researcher and provide the
research community with resources for investigating opioid circuits."

The ability to restore the microvasculature and improve perfusion, by expanding the population of endothelial
cells in vivo, would be a major advancement in cardiovascular medicine and create a novel therapeutic approach
to cardiovascular disease. The proposed studies, aimed at identifying the role of O-GlcNAcylation in
transdifferentiation and epigenetic plasticity, may reveal a novel mechanism of neovascularization and uncover
new avenues for therapeutic angiogenesis and vasculogenesis (Carmeliet, 2005, Isner 1999).
Activation of inflammatory signaling pathways is required to drive fibroblasts to undergo angiogenic
transdifferentiation and become endothelial cells in vitro (Sayed, 2015). This process requires cell autonomous
innate immune signaling, which triggers global changes in expression and activity of epigenetic modifiers (Lee,
2012). The term “transflammation” describes the process by which innate immune signaling promotes
epigenetic plasticity and phenotypic fluidity. Recently, it has been shown that a glycolytic shift contributes to
transdifferentiation by increased nuclear acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation (Lai, 2019).
Although this glycolytic switch links metabolism to epigenetic modelling, the contribution of other metabolites to
epigenetic plasticity in neovascularization remains unexplored. Preliminary data indicate that O-GlcNAcylation,
and nutrient driven post-translational modification (PTM), is significantly elevated in angiogenic
transdifferentiation and neovascularization following hindlimb ischemia. This observation raises the exciting
possibility that O-GlcNAcylation links cell fate plasticity to metabolism in vascular transdifferentiation, and that
targeting this PTM may be a new therapeutic avenue in regenerative medicine.
The overarching hypothesis is that O-GlcNAcylation enhances neovascularization in recovery from ischemic
injury by facilitating cell fate plasticity, and that perturbations to O-GlcNAcylation through genetic and
pharmacologic manipulation will attenuate transdifferentiation and diminish neovascularization. The immediate
goal will be to determine if O-GlcNAcylation is required for angiogenic transdifferentiation and to identify targets
of O-GlcNAcylation contributing to epigenetic plasticity and cell fate fluidity in vascular transdifferentiation and
neovascularization. The proposed studies on O-GlcNAcylation in transdifferentiation will identify an
epigenetic mechanism for cellular plasticity and a novel therapeutic target to enhance endogenous
neovascularization for treatment of cardiovascular disease. The long term goal is to evaluate the
therapeutic efficacy of targeting O-GlcNAcylation to enhance vascular recovery in non-ischemic and ischemic
models of cardiovascular disease, such as heart failure and myocardial infarction.
Aim 1: Determine the role of O-GlcNAcylation in transdifferentiation and DNA accessibility in vitro.
Aim 2: Determine the role of O-GlcNAcylation in transdifferentiation and neovascularization in vivo."
10608930,"Pharmacologically refractory epilepsy afflicts more than a million Americans. In a substantial proportion
(25%) of these cases, epilepsy originates in the mesial temporal lobes (mesial temporal lobe epilepsy;
MTLE), engaging and perturbing the neural mechanisms underlying episodic memory. While many patients
with MTLE are candidates for resective surgery, no reasonable resective or ablative options are feasible in
locations where viable memory and epilepsy co-exist – a condition we term Epilepsy in a Precious
Hippocampus (EPH). Current neuromodulation techniques and devices, inspired by stimulation parameters
for movement disorders, deliver unifocal high frequency stimulation. They have limited impact on seizure
burden and rarely result in durable seizure freedom. For the EPH conundrum, there is an urgent
requirement for more efficacious neuromodulatory solutions, since the threat of major morbidity and
mortality is otherwise substantial. We propose a novel network-based neuromodulation approach to disrupt
seizures at levels above what has previously been accomplished. Eight patients with EPH who have been
scheduled for stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) will be recruited at two busy epilepsy centers -
UTHealth Houston and the Mayo Clinic. They will undergo recordings from the anterior nucleus of the
thalamus (ANT) in addition to traditional SEEG targets in MTLE, while seizure foci are localized. Patients
will then undergo chronic depth electrode implants targeting pyriform cortex (area tempestus), ento-rhinal
cortex, fornix and ANT, and implantation of the Medtronic Percept PC Neurostimulator DBS System with
BrainSense Technology. Intracranial data from both implants will be used to build a comprehensive
individual and generalizable network model. We will demonstrate safety and efficacy of the Percept PC
device for detecting seizures. We will then utilize low frequency stimulation at each of these targets and
patterned network stimulation to determine their impact on seizures. The most effective approach will be
implemented for longer durations, and comparisons on seizure control will be made relative to baseline and
to traditional duty cycle high frequency ANT stimulation, that will be used as the control, wash-out
stimulation parameter between the trials of each stimulation type. This work promises to dramatically
improve our understanding of the MTLE network and develop a new approach to network based
neuromodulation."

Project Leader: Kyu Rhee
Co-investigator: Valerie Mizrahi
Collaborating investigators: Jeremy Rock (Core D), D. Branch Moody (Core B)
ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate specific cell envelope structure-activity relationships
mediating barrier function. A key and quite literal barrier to safer and simpler drugs and treatments for TB is its
highly unusual cell envelope. Improved knowledge of the barrier function of the Mtb envelope thus represents a
potential blueprint to developing better safer drugs. Unlike most bacteria, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
envelope consists in a unique multilayered structure whose physico-chemical properties are widely believed to
mediate an intrinsic mechanism of antibiotic resistance. Using newly developed whole organism chemical
profiling and genome scale CRISPRi technologies, we challenge the longstanding view of Mtb cell wall as a
static and impermeant chemical barrier. Preliminary studies indicate that the Mtb cell envelope is chemically
selective, and its barrier activity is not a simple product of its bulk physico-chemical properties. These data
further show that both its composition and barrier function are dynamically regulated. This project specifically
focuses on Mtb barrier function through the therapeutic lens of the frontline TB drug rifampicin. We focus on
rifampicin because of its unique treatment shortening and sterilizing activities against drug-sensitive TB, and its
defining role in the biology of drug-resistant TB. In addition, because rifampicin has a single, well understood
target of action, the b subunit of RNA polymerase, which is located in the cytosol, it serves as a potential model
that could elucidate general principles that apply to any drug with cytosolic targets."

Project Leader: Robin Wood
Co-investigators: Kyu Rhee, Sara Suliman, Digby Warner, D. Branch Moody
ABSTRACT
Sputum-based tests are a mainstay of modern tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics that have historically proven
invaluable. However, their utility has proven variable across clinical settings and patient populations where
disease prevalence and mortality are high, including diagnosing TB in children and HIV co-infected
patients. Existing diagnostics have further focused chiefly on disease detection. Yet, control of the TB
pandemic ultimately also requires the ability to monitor treatment efficacy and disease transmissibility.
Project 3 seeks to address these unmet diagnostic needs by developing a new panel of metabolite-based
biomarkers present in human serum and urine, which are readily obtained from nearly all subjects. Our
approach has the potential to enable real-time monitoring of treatment response, diagnose sputum-
negative cases, and report on clinical infectiousness. Using new mass spectrometry platforms for broad
and unbiased metabolite detection from serum and urine, we have discovered several host metabolites
whose levels enabled non-invasive diagnosis and treatment monitoring of TB. Levels of one metabolite,
diacetylspermine, were detectable with a clinical grade ELISA, and found to correlate with sputum bacterial
load and treatment response over 14 days of therapy in independent discovery and validation cohorts.
Going forward, we will validate these molecules further along the path to clinical development and use
broad mass spectrometry profiling of human serum and urine to detect new host and bacterial metabolites
associated with the TB disease state and treatment response. We will validate diacetylspermine,
sphingomyelin and other existing lead candidate metabolites for their clinical utility in a prospective cohort
of sputum-confirmed and sputum-negative TB patients during the initiation of chemotherapy. We will finally
measure viable Mtb contained in exhaled bioaerosols of TB patients as the biological foundation of efforts
to identify and develop diagnostic biomarkers of clinical infectiousness. We intend to validate new tests
based on existing serum and urine biomarkers that are suitable for entry into the NIAID Feasibility of Novel
Diagnostics for TB (FEND) program within the current TBRU term."

People living with HIV (PLH) are likely to cycle into and out of antiretroviral therapy (ART) services over time.
Even after return to HIV care (RTC), PLH who have interrupted treatment remain vulnerable to attrition and
poor treatment outcomes. A range of evidence-based ART support interventions exist including community-
based and mobile health (mHealth) ART support interventions. The overarching goals of this proposal are to
understand existing RTC practices, incorporate patient preference to refine a community-based and mHealth
ART support intervention, and examine the role of choice in delivering RTC ART support. Candidate: Dr.
Phillips is an HIV epidemiologist with training in quantitative research methods and experience with field
research implementation in South Africa. She is applying for a five-year Fogarty Emerging Global Leader
Award to obtain the additional training, mentorship and experience required to become a leading independent
investigator capable of obtaining R-series funding. Mentoring: She has assembled an exceptional
multidisciplinary team with extensive expertise in HIV intervention research in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Drs.
Myer (University of Cape Town (UCT)) and Chi (University of North Carolina (UNC)) will serve as primary
mentors providing complementary expertise on HIV intervention research and implementation science. Drs
Maman (UNC) and Knight (UCT), co-mentors, are social scientists with expertise in qualitative and behavioral
research particularly in the context of intervention design and evaluation. Dr. Thirumurthy (University of
Pennsylvania: expertise in behavioral economics and measuring patient preference), Dr. Bekker (UCT:
expertise in HIV care interventions and preference trials for contraceptive and HIV prevention methods), Dr.
Hosseinipour (UNC: expertise in clinical, health service and implementation science with long-term adult HIV
care in SSA) and Dr. Clouse (Vanderbilt University: expertise in mHealth intervention research in South Africa)
will provide scientific advice in these areas. Training: Specific training in intervention design and evaluation –
specifically incorporating implementation science, social and behavioral methods, and patient preference – will
be achieved through intensive mentored training and formal coursework. This, combined with the experience
gained through implementing my research aims, will establish Dr. Phillips’ independent research career
investigating interventions to support lifelong HIV care. Research: The specific aims of this research are to: 1)
characterize existing practices for providing RTC ART support and patient experience following RTC, 2) refine
existing community-based and mHealth ART support interventions based on RTC patient preferences for
modifiable attributes, and 3) determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of offering a choice
of ART support intervention to RTC patients. The results of this study will inform our understanding of RTC
ART support including the role of patient choice. They will provide preliminary data needed to apply for an R01
to conduct a patient preference trial to rigorously examine the impact of patient choice in ART support delivery."

The International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness with Medical and Invasive Approaches
(ISCHEMIA) EXTENDed Follow-up (EXTEND) is the long-term follow-up of randomized, surviving participants
in ISCHEMIA. This NHLBI-supported trial randomized 5,179 participants with stable ischemic heart disease to
two different management strategies: 1) an initial invasive strategy (INV) of cardiac catheterization and
revascularization when feasible plus guidelines-based medical therapy (GBMT), or 2) an initial conservative
strategy of GBMT. The trial did not demonstrate a reduction in the primary endpoint with an initial invasive
strategy. There was an excess of peri-procedural myocardial infarction (MI) and a reduction in spontaneous MI
in the INV group. Prior evidence demonstrates that spontaneous MI carries a higher risk of subsequent death
than peri-procedural MI. There was a late separation in the cardiovascular (CV) mortality curves, over a
median of 3.2 years follow-up in ISCHEMIA. The overall reduction in MI rates with an INV strategy did not
emerge until after 2 years. Therefore, based on the observed reduction in spontaneous MI, it is imperative to
ascertain long-term vital status to provide patients and clinicians with robust evidence on whether INV strategy
reduces CV and all-cause death over the long-term. With projected 728 CV deaths (1000 total) we have
adequate power to detect a between group difference. It is equally important to improve precision around the
point estimate to rule out a benefit if none exists. Regardless of the study findings, robust long-term mortality
data have enormous implications for clinical guidelines and practice, as affirmed by independent experts who
write and oversee the development of national guidelines, and who provided letters of support. We will also
quantify the impact of nonfatal CV events on subsequent mortality in ISCHEMIA-EXTEND, construct a risk
score for mortality using baseline deep phenotypic data, and provide estimates of the impact of INV in the
highest risk subgroup – those with severe coronary artery disease for whom current practice guidelines
recommend coronary artery bypass (CABG) to improve survival. We have obtained all required approvals and
99% of consents. We are ready to conduct extended follow-up of death, including cause of death, on >99% of
surviving participants resulting in 10-year median follow-up. We will ascertain vital status by participant/proxy
contact every 6 months via telephone or email, or by searching high-quality national/regional health/death
databases. Participant last contact date, date of death, cause of death, and source of information will be
collected and entered into a web-based electronic data capture system. Our excellent participant retention,
adherence to protocol, data completeness and quality during the initial trial phase, and our subsequent
progress, with required approvals and consents secured, assure confidence that the study will meet its goals."
10855758,"Project Summary
The long lasting decrease of saliva secretion, also called dry mouth, is common in patients
treated with radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. This side effect significantly impairs
the quality of life of affected patients and is difficult to remedy. The applicant’s recent work
revealed that macrophages abundant in salivary glands are sharply damaged by
radiotherapy, and their recovery is required for restoring saliva secretion. The goals of this
proposal are to determine the roles of local macrophages in the development,
maintenance and regeneration of salivary glands, and how these cells respond to radiation
and restore salivary function damaged by radiation. To achieve these goals, this project
will trace the origin of local macrophages under conditions mentioned above, determine
effects of removing these cells on salivary function, and pinpoint which molecules are
responsible for the damage of these cells by radiation and for the recovery of salivary
function damaged by radiation. Completion of this project will reveal vital roles of local
macrophages and their products in the maintenance of saliva secretion, and form a basis
for developing novel and feasible approaches to treating dry mouth caused by
radiotherapy."
10820525,"Persistent pain is common and debilitating. Long after apparent remission of the pain initiated by
the primary insult, some patients experience relapse and recurrent episodes of severe pain. The
long-term goal of this project is to decipher mechanisms that regulate the balance between
remission and relapse of pain. Understanding these mechanisms will help to identify new
therapeutic strategies to prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain and reduce the use of
opioid for treatment of pain. We have developed a new mouse model to study the remission and
relapse of pain. After a primary insult (surgical incision or a short dose of chemotherapy), a short
period of pain (acute pain) is followed by remission in which pain sensitivity is absent. However,
during remission pain can be reinstated by inhibition of anti-inflammatory cytokine or opioid
receptor signaling, neither of which affect pain sensitivity in naive animals. Our preliminary data
show that interleukin (IL)-10 is permanently upregulated during remission from pain and keeps
neuroinflammation silent and upregulates δ-opioid receptor (δOR) gene expression and analgesic
effects.
This suggests that remission is a sensitized state that results from long-term neuroplasticity in
the nociceptive system, which if inhibited will trigger relapse of pain. Our long-term goal is to
switch transient remission to permanent recovery. Towards this goal, the central hypothesis of
our proposal is that persistent IL-10 signaling is necessary to prevent the relapse to pain by
keeping neuroinflammation silent and facilitating the activation of the endogenous opioid
system. Thus, we will test this hypothesis with 2 specific aims. Our first aim will test the
hypothesis that IL-10 signaling acts as a “brake” to keep neuroinflammation latent and prevents
relapse to pain. Our second aim will investigate the hypothesis that relapse is prevented
because IL-10 signaling promotes upregulation of gene expression and functional activation of
δOR in the DRG. This proposal will fill critical gaps of knowledge on the roles of neuroimmune
and immune-opioid crosstalk in chronic pain.
Because regulation of the remission and relapse of pain has not been investigated previously,
our model of pain recurrence can transform our knowledge on long lasting nociceptive plasticity
in chronic pain. Ultimately, it could transform clinical practices by treating patients in remission
to prevent the relapse of pain."

How a given protein organizes into a functional complex in health and disease is particularly relevant for
membrane proteins that serve as key information entry points for cells. A suitable and highly relevant example
is voltage-gated L-type CaV1.2 channels, which play a major role in arterial myocyte function and vascular
reactivity. These channels have been shown to gate in unison (i.e. cooperative gating) to amplify Ca2+ influx. At
present, however, a comprehensive understanding of mechanisms fostering the induction of CaV1.2 cooperative
gating as well as its functional implications in health and disease represent major knowledge gaps. The overall
objective of this proposal is to investigate the requirement and physiological consequences whereby
phosphorylation of a single amino acid – S1928 – in the C-terminal of vascular CaV1.2 channels promotes
dynamic spatial organization of CaV1.2 to facilitate cooperative gating at the surface membrane. To accomplish
this goal, we are testing the central hypothesis that CaV1.2 S1928 phosphorylation tunes dynamic channel
clustering and cooperative gating, and that this contributes to modulate vascular function in response to elevated
extracellular glucose and during diabetes. This hypothesis is formulated on the basis of strong and rigorous
preliminary data revealing an unanticipated and remarkable role for S1928 phosphorylation as the culprit for
redistribution and assembly of CaV1.2 subunits into superclusters at the surface membrane of arterial myocytes
upon elevated glucose and diabetes. CaV1.2 superclusters mediated by S1928 phosphorylation promotes
CaV1.2 cooperative gating and Ca2+ influx amplification into arterial myocytes. Key findings that further
underscore the significance of our observations is that CaV1.2 S1928 phosphorylation is necessary for
activation of prohypertensive signaling pathways, vasoconstriction and altered blood flow upon elevated glucose
and during diabetes. Moreover, critical observations have been validated in freshly dissociated human arterial
myocytes from nondiabetic and diabetic patients, underscoring the translational relevance. Emerging and
innovative concepts that will be explored in this application are the role of S1928 phosphorylation as 1) a
rheostat of CaV1.2 function and vascular reactivity and 2) a major risk factor for vascular complications in
diabetes. A multiscale contemporary approach that includes innovative microscopy techniques, sophisticated
biochemistry, electrophysiology, in silico analysis and unique animal models will be implemented to explore the
following aims. Aim 1 is to elucidate the role of S1928 phosphorylation in dynamic CaV1.2 clustering and
cooperative gating upon elevated glucose. Aim 2 is to examine the requirement of S1928 phosphorylation to
induce CaV1.2 superclustering and cooperative gating in arterial myocytes during diabetes. Results will transform
our understanding of how CaV1.2 are organized in arterial myocytes (and perhaps other cells) in health and
disease and may lay the foundation for novel therapeutic strategies with single amino acid accuracy to correct
channel function and vascular reactivity."

In 2020 malaria cases (241M) and deaths (627,000) reached the highest since 2012 emphasizing the urgent
need for new tools for prevention, control, and elimination of this disease. Sanaria’s Plasmodium falciparum
(Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccine, composed of radiation attenuated PfSPZ administered by intravenous injection,
assessed in 1740 subjects aged 5 months to 61 years in 6 countries in US, Europe and Africa, is safe and
protective for 18 months in Africa, while PfSPZ-CVac (chemo-attenuated) conferred 100% protection against
heterologous controlled human malaria infection for at least 12 weeks. PfSPZ are produced using aseptically
reared female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. Only females ingest blood, so in the current manufacturing
process, aseptic male mosquitoes are superfluous, consuming growth medium and occupy space that could
otherwise be used for production of more females at no additional cost or effort. In this project we plan to make
the aseptic mosquito rearing process 2-fold more efficient (reducing costs of vaccine manufacture by 10-15%)
by removing male mosquitoes from the system at the embryonic stage. This will be achieved by creating a
mosquito line in which males are conditionally expressing a lethal insect-specific hybrid toxin, originally
produced by spiders. The lethality will be induced on a switch, using the Tetracycline-controlled gene
expression system. In our specific aims we will: 1. Establish a driver line: a transgenic A. stephensi line
carrying the Tet-On transactivator (rtTA). A transgenic line will be created by inserting the rtTA, under the
tight control of the vasa promoter, which is expressed in the first few hours after egg laying. The construct will
be inserted using piggyBac-based germline modification. In the absence of doxycycline, rtTA should not bind to
the Tetracycline responsive element (TRE) and thus the lethal gene will be inactive when expression is not
wanted. 2. Establish a Y-linked docking A. stephensi line. We have identified specific Y-chromosome
genomic loci which can be used to target integration of the locus of X (lox) docking sites. RFP under the 3xP3
promoter, flanked by two lox sites will be introduced to the identified Y sequences using CRISPR-Cas9
mediated homology-derived repair. 3. Establish an effector line: A. stephensi carrying Y-linked spider
hybrid toxin under the control of the Tetracycline Response Element (TRE). The Y-linked docking line will
be used to integrate a gene cassette containing TRE, minimal promoter and the hybrid toxin via lox sites using
the cre/lox recombinase-mediated cassette exchange. In this transgenic line the lethal hybrid toxin will be
expressed only in male mosquitoes when both doxycycline and rtTA are available; in the absence of
doxycycline and rtTA no lethality is anticipated. 4. Generate a transgenic conditional male-lethal sexing
strain of A. stephensi. Females from the driver line will be crossed with males from the effector line. In the
progenitor male eggs, the rtTA will bind to TRE in the presence of doxycycline, driving the expression of the
toxin and induce male lethality, while in the absence of doxycycline both sexes will survive."

Raydiant Oximetry, Inc. (Raydiant) has developed and patented a novel optical-sensing technology (‘LumerahTM’)
to directly assess fetal status during labor and delivery through non-invasive, transabdominal measurement of fetal
oxygenation. This technology will allow clinicians to directly monitor intrapartum fetal oxygenation. There are
serious and significant limitations in the use of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring by cardiotocography (CTG) for
monitoring fetal status during labor and detection of fetal compromise due to hypoxia. Owing to misinterpretation
and inherent limitations of CTG, there is an intolerably high false positive rate (89%) for detecting fetal hypoxemia
that has resulted in high rates of medically unnecessary cesarean deliveries. Cesarean delivery is not benign; it has
potential adverse consequences for mothers and newborns and incurs substantial unnecessary healthcare cost.
Furthermore, CTG false negatives, when fetal hypoxia is unrecognized owing to misinterpretation of CTG, result in
devastating neonatal consequences, such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy that also incurs substantial
healthcare cost. Monitoring fetal oxygenation in conjunction with CTG will provide a more precise modality of fetal
surveillance during labor and delivery, safely reduce the use of medically unnecessary cesarean deliveries, and
reduce the occurrence of newborns suffering consequences of metabolic acidosis
In prior studies, supported by SBIR Phase I & II awards, Raydiant Oximetry: (i) developed computational models of
fetal and maternal tissues in 2D and 3D to inform hardware design, algorithm development and feature set
extraction; (ii) obtained first-in-human feasibility data in a clinical study of 6 pregnant women to validate the
computational modeling efforts (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04081623); and (iii) validated the approach with preclinical
studies in the pregnant ewe model.
The proposed Phase II SBIR builds directly upon these results. The goals of this research are to advance this
technology towards commercialization by collecting human data training sets to refine the computational algorithm
that allows separation of the fetal from maternal near infrared signals and then validate this algorithm to support
an upcoming IDE filing with the FDA.
This Phase II SBIR application is in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOT-HD-21-053) from the NICHD to
advance the development of non-invasive, physiological monitors that improve fetal assessment through the non-
invasive measurement of fetal blood pH or oxygenation."

The need to develop sensitive, specific, and more easily available point-of-care technologies for diagnosing STIs
is critical. Many countries, including the US, have seen a sharp increase in the incidence of STIs over the past
half-decade, and especially since 2020. Many cases go undiagnosed and untreated, and 30% of patients may
never get treatment after testing positive. Some of these STIs have the potential to cause serious health
problems, including infertility, especially if not diagnosed and treated early. Stigma, privacy, and confidentiality
issues make STIs optimal areas for POC tests at healthcare facilities, as they can reduce loss to follow-up,
increase patient and partner treatment rates, and avoid the use of unnecessary antibiotic treatment.
The company has developed a Molecular Point of Care platform, the AmplifiDxTM DX-1000, which is capable of
rapid, molecular testing using direct swabs as the sample type. The system has five optical channels, allowing
detection of up to 4 infectious targets plus an internal control. The DX-1000 is differentiated and well-suited for
the infectious disease testing market. The chemistry is multiplexed and sensitive, yet simple, allowing for a
miniaturized product that will be attractive in the point-of-care space. The workflow is easy - one-step, swab to
answer - and does not require complex mixing of reagents or handling of multiple stages of the process. Lab-
quality results will be delivers in as little as 30 minutes for COVID-19. 20 minutes are possible for DNA
parameters as the number of assay steps can be less. The sleek cartridge and instrument are designed for low-
cost manufacturing. AmplifiDx is poised to submit a first Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the FDA for a
COVID-19 diagnostic, which is the basis for the proposed assay for STIs and relevant resistance markers.
We propose the development of an assay which will detect Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhea
(NG), as well as mutations associated with antibiotic resistance or susceptibility in NG. We also propose the
development of a urine collection device that fits easily in to the existing workflow, to give doctors the choice of
another sample type. This assay, which will be used with urogenital swabs or urine samples on the DX-1000
device and cartridge, will provide quick, actionable diagnosis for CT and NG at point of care, as well as guiding
treatment decisions and promoting antibiotic stewardship by identifying antibiotic-related mutations."

The goal of this Stimulating Access to Research in Residency (StARR) proposal is to recruit, train, and
mentor a multidisciplinary group of exceptional UCSF postgraduate resident investigators in acquiring
rigorous clinical and translational research skills, conducting high-impact and clinically relevant research,
and launching promising research careers in cardiovascular, respiratory, or non-malignant hematologic
diseases. This application builds on a large and diverse faculty with expertise in clinical and translational
research, a strong institutional track record in multidisciplinary postgraduate research training, and an
existing, successful Resident Research Training Program developed by our Clinical and Translational
Science Institute (CTSI) that provides a strong foundation for this initiative.
Our StARR program will emphasize clinical and translational research, defined broadly to include early
translational research involving human tissues, clinical and epidemiologic investigations, population-based
science, and dissemination research to translate scientific findings into real-world settings. We have already
designed an intensive, 12-month, contiguous resident research training program that emphasizes rigorous
training in clinical and translational research methods, recognizing that many clinician scholars seeking to
pursue clinical or translational research lack formal methodologic research training. For this application, we
have worked closely with residency leaders from eight clinical departments (internal medicine, pediatrics,
anesthesia, laboratory medicine, general surgery, integrated vascular surgery, emergency medicine, and
obstetrics and gynecology) to develop a detailed plan for recruiting and selecting the most promising
resident investigators who can bring diverse clinical perspectives to cardiovascular, pulmonary, or
hematologic science. With StARR funding, we propose to enhance residents' research and career
development opportunities, cultivate their relationships with experienced faculty mentors, and guide them in
obtaining future research funding, while simultaneously fulfilling all board credentialing requirements.
In this application, we aim to: 1) recruit and train 3 outstanding clinical residents annually from a diverse set
of residency programs who have the potential to develop successful research careers in cardiovascular,
respiratory, or non-malignant hematologic diseases; 2) guide these residents in obtaining more advanced
methodological, analytic, and collaborative research skills appropriate for their level of training; 3) create and
support effective, influential, and long-lasting research mentor relationships during and after residency; 4)
integrate residents into a community of other scientists-in-training to facilitate networking and exchange of
ideas; and 5) guide residents in successfully competing for other forms of research support that will pave the
way for them to pursue long-term clinical and translational science careers."

Gaps in academic achievement lead to gross racial disparities in mental health, physical health,
and substance use and abuse and compound inequalities, threatening individual as well as
social and national economic well-being. Black children represent one group at substantial risk
for educational underachievement due to dialect mismatch effects that can hamper reading
performance: Ninety percent Black children speak African American English (AAE) as their
primary dialect, yet the learning environment in the school is that of Mainstream American
English (MAE). Dialect mismatch effects have been tested using offline measures of language
production and comprehension in Black children, ages 5- to 8 years, when reading skills are
coming online. However, language production measures cannot expose subtle interruptions in
AAE speakers’ comprehension as they learn in MAE. Thus, there is a critical need for measures
sensitive to moment-by-moment language processing. In the absence of such methods, the
promise of understanding potential educational costs of dialect mismatch effects will likely
remain elusive.
Our central hypothesis is that school-aged Black children with stronger language skills will be
sensitive to violations of phonology and grammar in AAE and MAE, but that school-age children
with weaker language skills will show little sensitivity to such violations. Our hypothesis has
been formulated based on extant research linking children’s processing speed with language
ability. Further, our own pilot data, conducted with White speakers of MAE, demonstrated
statistically significant differences in time spent looking at stimuli when language input does or
does not contain linguistic violations. We plan to attain the overall objective by pursing the
following specific aims: (1) to apply eye-tracking to evaluate sensitivities to violations of
phonology and grammar in both MAE and AAE, in 7-year-old Black children; and (2) to
determine how well eye-tracking profiles align with measures of language production commonly
used in clinical practice.
At the completion of the proposed project, our expected outcomes are to have identified key
dialect detection profiles of typically-developing Black children. These results will provide a
foundational evidence base on dialect detection in young Black children, supplying insights into
normative development that have potential applications to the treatment of developmental
language disorder."

Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common congenital malformations. However, the molecular
etiology underlying most CHDs remain poorly understood. Furthermore, CHDs even following surgery can lead
to complications later in life that result in arrhythmias, stroke, and premature death. In order to develop novel
therapies able to prevent CHDs and target therapies to specific cardiovascular tissues, it is critical to garner
understanding of fundamental mechanisms directing normal cardiac chamber development and regeneration.
Therefore, long-term goals of our lab are to understand conserved mechanisms that direct the development of
individual cardiac chambers and chamber-specific mechanisms utilized during regeneration in vertebrates.
Few signals are known to be required that specifically direct atrial development, with specific regulators of atrial
regeneration not being understood. The specific aims of this proposal are to elucidate the mechanisms by
which a syntenic long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) family limits the expression of Nr2f transcription factors and
decipher how Nr2f protein levels affect atrial heterogeneity during development and atrial regeneration in adult
zebrafish. The studies in this proposal are relevant to human health as numerous genomic analyses now
indicate that mutations in Nr2f2 are associated with CHDs, in particular ASDs in humans. While Nr2f2 knockout
mice and in vitro studies with human stem cells have revealed requirements for both Nr2f1 and Nr2f2 in atrial
development, the mechanisms by which Nr2f proteins direct proper atrial development are not completely
understood. Importantly, there is currently no understanding of lncRNA-dependent mechanisms regulating Nr2f
proteins. Our analysis of a lncRNA we call as-oca shows that in vivo it represses the translation of nr2f1a, the
functional equivalent of mammalian Nr2f2. Moreover, we find that Nr2f1a levels regulate previously
unrecognized heterogeneity of atrial cardiomyocytes in the embryonic atrium and atrial regeneration. In Aim 1,
we will examine the specific mechanism that as-oca inhibits nr2f1a translation and the conservation of this
mechanism among the NR2F-associated lncRNA family in human induced pluripotent stem cells. In Aim 2, we
will examine the requirements of Nr2f1a and canonical Wnt signaling in generating atrial cardiomyocyte
diversity and the transcriptional signature of a previously unrecognized atrial subpopulation. In Aim 3, we will
examine the requirement of the epicardium in atrial regeneration and requirement of Nr2f1a within the atrial
epicardium. Because Nr2f transcription factors play conserved roles in atrial development of all vertebrates,
these studies will dramatically improve our understanding of post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating normal
vertebrate atrial development and unique mechanisms employed during atrial regeneration. Ultimately, these
studies will garner a foundation of knowledge that can be used to improve therapies capable of preventing and
ameliorating CHDs and efficiently repairing injured hearts."

Voltage-gated calcium channels (CaVs) are indispensable components of the presynaptic active zone because
they directly drive synaptic transmission. However, the expression of CaVs within the presynaptic terminal
presents a considerable trafficking dilemma. Presynaptic CaVs are synthesized at the cell body where they are
often separated from their final destinations by hundreds of millimeters. CaVs en route to the presynaptic terminal
must therefore navigate multiple trafficking checkpoints that restrict passage of misdirected cargoes including
export from the Golgi apparatus, entry into the axon compartment, cargo capture at presynaptic terminals, and
finally anchoring within the active zone. Further, all neuronal CaVs exhibit a significant degree of sequence and
structural homology, including those that sort exclusively into somatic and dendritic compartments. In
consequence, the mechanistic pathways that target CaVs specifically to the presynaptic terminals remain
obscure, despite their central importance to neuronal activity.
In this proposal I will focus on dissecting the trafficking of CaV2.1s, a major presynaptic CaV isoform. Recent
studies have established the CaV2.1 C-terminus as a critical locus of targeting sequences. In addition to motifs
that tether CaV2.1s to the active zone scaffold, my preliminary data reveals that the proximal region of the CaV2.1
C-terminus contains key sequences that are together necessary for presynaptic expression. Further, I show the
compartment targeting of CaVs is determined primarily by its C-terminal sequences. I therefore hypothesize
that the CaV2.1 proximal C-terminus is a key determinant for CaV2.1 active zone targeting and function. I
will test this hypothesis through two specific aims. In aim 1, I will identify the trafficking checkpoints that require
the proximal C-terminus. My preliminary data establish that mutations within the proximal C-terminus abolish
presynaptic localization of CaV2.1s. My goal is to identify the specific trafficking checkpoint that is disrupted. I
will evaluate how proximal C-terminus mutations affect the Golgi export, axon targeting, presynaptic capture,
and active zone anchoring of CaV2.1 cargoes by visualizing CaV2.1s in the somas and axons of neurons and at
the plasma membrane in cell lines. In aim 2, I will define the minimal CaV2.1 sequences for active zone
localization and function. In preliminary experiments, I show that the transfer of key targeting sequences from
CaV2.1 to CaV1 can redirect these channels from the soma and dendrites to the presynaptic active zone. I will
generate further chimeric CaVs to isolate the trafficking functions of individual CaV2.1 sequences. I will
comprehensively probe for rescue of synaptic transmission in neurons that re-express CaV chimeras by means
STED microscopy, calcium imaging and electrophysiology. In summary, this proposal addresses a fundamental
gap in our understanding of presynaptic CaV trafficking. The findings from these experiments will reveal novel
regulatory mechanisms in CaV trafficking and they may in turn inform healthcare of neuropathies that stem from
the aberrant expression and trafficking of presynaptic CaVs."

In collaboration with a non-human primate (NHP) consortium with over a decade of experience studying the
developmental origins of health and disease in response to maternal overnutrition, this proposal will evaluate
the effect that intrauterine exposure to metformin and overnutrition has on the development of pancreatic beta
cells and islet mitochondrial health in fetal Rhesus macaques. In the United States, 31% of women of
childbearing age are classified as overweight or obese. As global rates of obesity rise, the influence of
developmental exposure to maternal overnutrition and the drugs prescribed to treat maternal metabolic
disease on offspring metabolic outcomes is of critical interest. Metformin is typically prescribed for the
treatment of Type 2 Diabetes; however, use of metformin has been expanded over the past decade to
treatment for gestational diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and preeclampsia. Data suggests that
metformin crosses the placental barrier and equilibrates in fetal circulation, raising concerns for unintended
fetal harm. While the target of metformin is unknown, a proposed mechanism of metformin is activation of 5’
adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), a nutrient sensing kinase that is central to regulation of pathways
associated with cellular growth, proliferation, metabolism, and epigenetic regulation. Metformin has also been
shown to inhibit complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, reducing the production of ATP, which
is important for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from beta cells. The goal of the studies outlined in this
proposal is to elucidate the influence that maternal consumption of a western style diet and metformin has on
beta-cell mass, identity, and function at the fetal stage of development in a highly relevant NHP model.
Additionally, this proposal includes studies investigating the individual and combined effects of maternal
overnutrition and metformin on islet mitochondrial morphology and function in offspring. To accomplish these
goals, I will use high resolution microscopy, real time metabolic analyses, and single nucleus RNA sequencing
to identify programmed mechanisms that may correlate to increased propensity for beta cell failure later in the
offspring’s life."

 Animals have evolved specialized neural circuitry that links sensory input to neuroendocrine and behavioral
responses. The proper function of these systems is essential for the health and wellbeing of individuals.
Sensory inputs controls some fundamentally important innate behaviors, including mating, aggression and
parental behaviors. Dysfunction in these circuits may lead to depression, mood disorders, sexual dysfunction,
and aberrant parental behaviors. Here we propose to study the neural circuits that detect and process
pheromone information and regulate endocrine and behavioral responses in rodents. In vertebrates,
pheromone cues can directly trigger mating rituals and territorial aggression. Many terrestrial species have
evolved highly sophisticated vomeronasal systems to detect pheromones. The vomeronasal circuit connects
directly to the endocrine systems and influences their output. These circuits are largely genetically determined
and there is an intrinsic link between sensory input and the behavioral responses. The mouse vomeronasal
circuitry, therefore, serves as an ideal model system to elucidate the neural mechanism of sensory information
processing, mechanism of neuroendocrine control and sensory control of innate behaviors. Similar circuits
exist in humans but may have been compacted during primate evolution to consist of mostly the main olfactory
system, and to include other sensory modalities. The study of the vomeronasal system can provide a roadmap
to understand these more complex circuits.
 The objective of this application is to delineate the vomeronasal circuitry that detects and processes
information of two classes of female pheromones. The proposal is based on our study identifying two sets of
vomeronasal receptors recognizing pheromones cues that convey the sexual identity and the estrus status of
female mice, respectively. In this study, we will determine the contribution of vomeronasal sensory neurons
(VSNs) expressing these receptors to sexual behaviors. We will investigate and determine the connectivity
diagram between the VSNs and the mitral cells in the accessory olfactory bulb. We will also identify the brain
regions and specific cell populations that process information conveyed by these cues and map their
connections. These studies are expected to reveal highly specific neural circuits that control mating behaviors"
10917044,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypertension (HTN) is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Nearly half of HTN
patients are resistant or nonadherent to lifestyle modification and drug-based therapy, so novel therapies are
desperately needed. While HTN is associated with increased global sympathetic nerve activity, renal efferent
nerves have traditionally been the focus of research since they transmit sympathetic nerve impulses from the
brain to regulate blood pressure. However, the kidneys are also innervated by renal afferent (sensory) nerves,
which project to circuits in the brain that modulate sympathetic nerve output and cause HTN. Clinical trials using
catheter-based total (efferent and afferent) renal nerve ablation (TRDN) have been shown to effectively lower
arterial pressure in treatment-resistant HTN patients. Despite this intervention’s efficacy, it is unknown if ablation
of the efferent or afferent renal nerves is more important in lowering arterial pressure. To elucidate the role that
afferent renal nerves play in HTN, our laboratory developed a novel method of afferent renal nerve ablation
(ARDN) and found that ARDN was as effective as TRDN in decreasing arterial pressure in the
deoxycorticosterone acetate and high salt diet (DOCA-salt) induced HTN rodent model. Clinically, if ARDN can
lower arterial pressure to the same degree as TRDN, efferent renal nerves could be preserved to maintain blood
pressure and volume in response to hemorrhagic or septic shock. Furthermore, TRDN has shown variable
efficacy in certain patients, and the lack of biomarkers to predict the arterial pressure response to TRDN is a
major gap in the field. Recent studies from our lab suggest that the presence of specific inflammatory cytokines
in the urine can identify renal inflammation. These cytokines can overstimulate afferent renal nerves and cause
increased global sympathetic nerve output and HTN. I plan on translating our findings from DOCA-salt HTN
rodents to the DOCA-salt HTN sheep model. The anatomic, physiologic, and hemodynamic properties of HTN
sheep more closely resemble human pathophysiology and allows for the use of human TRDN catheters.
Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to develop and validate a catheter-based ARDN method using the
HTN sheep model to address current gaps in the field and move closer to a clinical therapeutic for hypertension.
Our central hypothesis is that catheter-based ARDN will decrease arterial pressure to the same degree as TRDN,
and the arterial pressure response to TRDN can be predicted by specific urinary markers of renal inflammation.
I will test this hypothesis with the following aims: (1) Compare the efficacy of catheter-based ARDN versus TRDN
in an established model of HTN in sheep. (2) Validate the utility of urinary biomarkers to measure renal
inflammation associated with HTN to predict the anti-HTN efficacy of TRDN. If successful, the results of the
proposed studies will provide a translational platform to subsequently move into clinical trials of catheter-based
ARDN in humans. Furthermore, this catheter-based neuromodulation approach can also be applied to other
organs (liver, spleen) in which chronic inflammation drives other neurogenically based diseases."

The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Pre-Doctoral
Fellowship in Nursing Research (F31) application is to provide research training for Ms. Yoo, a beginning
second-year doctoral student at the University of Washington (UW). The long-term goal of this training is for
Ms. Yoo to develop into an independent researcher at a research-intensive academic setting with a program of
research focused on improving health outcomes of persons with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through the
development of self-management strategies that address biological and socio-ecological factors. The costs of
care and prevalence of IBD, a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease, have been rising in the United States. IBD
symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, abdominal pain) negatively impact quality of life, work productivity, and school
attendance; thus, there is a clear need to explore behavior modifications (e.g., behavior-influenced sleep-wake
cycles) to mitigate the symptoms of those with IBD. Although animal models have shown the adverse effects of
disrupted sleep-wake cycles on the GI system (e.g., intestinal dysbiosis), there is little research that focuses on
the impact of inconsistent sleep-wake cycles on IBD health outcomes as well role of external socio-ecological
factors (e.g., work and family obligations) on sleep-wake cycles of those with IBD. The aims of the proposed
study that employ both quantitative and qualitative methods are to understand the relationship between rest-
activity rhythm (RAR) characteristics and social jetlag with fatigue, sleep quality, GI symptoms, and disease
activity, and identify the social and societal factors that impact sleep-wake cycles. Unlike most IBD sleep
studies, this study will use objective actigraphy to measure RARs and social jetlag, and a qualitative portion will
provide additional insight from IBD participants on socio-ecological factors that impact sleep-wake cycles which
quantitative measures cannot fully capture. The socio-ecological model of health and sleep will guide the
research project to consider the societal, social, and individual level impacts of sleep-wake cycles on IBD
outcomes. The principal investigator will collect prospective data on 24 IBD participants from the University of
Washington Medical Center's gastroenterology clinic and leverage existing data on 26 IBD participants from a
previous study focused on nighttime sleep outcomes, resulting in a total of 50 participants. This award will
prepare a pre-doctoral trainee through advanced coursework and direct research experience, qualitative and
quantitative methods, focused analysis of RARs, and discovery of the relationships among three different
concepts related to sleep-wake cycles and IBD-related health outcomes. The findings generated from this
investigation will provide foundational knowledge for building a new program of research in self-management
and symptom science in IBD."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are now established as important regulators of diverse biological processes.
Tens of thousands of non-coding transcripts have been detected by RNA sequencing, yet only a minute fraction
of these have been functionally characterized. LncRNAs are of potential clinical significance, as they are
increasingly considered as targets for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. We have established
a systematic approach to specifically identify lncRNAs that are likely to be functional regulators of the immune
system and that may be involved in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This discovery pipeline integrates
information from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), evolutionary conservation between mice and
humans, and differential expression patterns in immune cells. Using this approach, we have identified a
previously unknown human lncRNA, which we have named lnc15. Lnc15 is present in mice and humans, and
overlaps with a single-nucleotide polymorphism that has been linked to Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis,
two severe intestinal auto-immune pathologies. Importantly, we have found that lnc15 is present at high levels
in regulatory T cells (Tregs) but only at low levels in other T-cell subsets. We have generated lnc15 knockout
mice and, intriguingly, have observed that these animals exhibit exacerbated disease progression in a model of
intestinal inflammation. Additionally, Tregs isolated from lnc15-deficient mice are less effective at suppressing
the proliferation of naive T cells, whereas overexpression of lnc15 enhances expression of IL-10, an important
effector cytokine of Tregs. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that lnc15 is a novel regulator of Treg
function. The experiments proposed here will explore this hypothesis by determining how lnc15 affects the Treg
transcriptome and identifying its protein and chromatin interaction partners. To evaluate the physiological
relevance of lnc15 in vivo, we further propose to utilize Treg-specific models of intestinal inflammation and
determine the effect of lnc15 deficiency on T-cell development, differentiation and homeostasis."

The importance of communications between nerve cells and immune cells in skin has been increasingly
recognized, as are the contributions of sensory neurons and the neuropeptides they produce to skin inflammation
and disease. Topical therapeutics that target neuro-immune interactions are needed to curtail aberrant skin
inflammation in diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis and to alleviate the disease-associated
pathology, pain, and itch. Our ongoing research aims to develop effective topical options to complement systemic
immune-targeting biologics, providing targeted relief and improving patient outcomes. The goals of this
application are to develop recombinant, cell-penetrating botulinum proteases that inhibit the release of
neuropeptides and cytokines in neurons and immune cells, respectively, to examine the in vivo penetration of
topically applied proteases into skin with mild barrier perturbation, and to test the utility of the engineered
proteases in reducing skin inflammation. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), such as Botox®, have been widely
used in clinics as medicines and cosmetics. BoNT specifically targets motor neurons and deliver its light chain
(LC) protease to the cytosol, where it proteolytically cleaves SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor
attachment protein receptors) proteins and blocks neurotransmitter release. Prior studies also suggest that
BoNTs are able to suppress neuropeptide secretion, such as substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP), in the skin via disrupting SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion and lead to improvement of
inflammation in psoriasis. However, the therapeutic potential of conventional BoNTs in psoriasis is inherently
restricted because BoNTs preferentially target motor neurons over sensory neurons and they are ineffective on
immune cells. To overcome these limitations, we have engineered recombinant cell-penetrating LC proteases of
BoNT that can autonomously enter cells and selectively cleave SNAREs in sensory neurons and/or immune
cells to regulate neuropeptide secretion and immunological effects. Here, we propose to further develop and
characterize cell-penetrating LC proteases and examine how they inhibit vesicle fusion and secretion in cultured
neurons and immune cells (Aim 1). We will also characterize the activity of the engineered LC variants in mouse
skin with topical delivery and perform preclinical studies to examine how topically applied LCs affect skin
inflammatory response using mouse models of psoriasis (Aim 2). Completion of this work will result in a new and
widely-applicable strategy to regulate inflammation in skin that can be further developed as topical therapeutic
candidates for the treatment of many skin diseases."

We propose to develop, use and share two important resources for the study of cognitively unimpaired (CU) 50-
90 year-old persons at six levels of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to their apolipoprotein E (APOE)
genotype. The Arizona APOE Cohort will include 300 CU persons with the APOE2/2, 2/3, 3/3, 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4
genotypes who are stratified for genotype and age decile and matched for sex and education. They will provide
a comprehensive longitudinal resource of genetic, non-genetic, clinical, cognitive and related data, brain imaging,
CSF and emerging blood-based biomarker (BBB) measurements of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathophysiology,
neuronal injury and/or neurodegeneration and inflammation (“A,T,N,I”) and CSF, blood and DNA samples.
GeneMatch will provide an unusually large resource of potentially interested CU APOE-genotyped persons for
enrollment in this project and other studies. It will include persons in the wider 50-90 years age range,
characterize the six most common APOE genotypes, identify understudied APOE2 and APOE4 homozygotes
(HMs), as well as those with rare and potentially protective APOE variants, and support their enrollment in the
longitudinal Arizona APOE Cohort and other studies. We will use these resources to 1) detect and track different
A,T,N,I biomarkers; 2) determine the ages at which they rise, plateau and/or decline for each APOE genotype;
3) characterize the differential impact of APOE2 and APOE4 allelic doses, other suggested genetic and non-
genetic factors, and their interactions with our preclinical A,T,N,I endophenotypes in 50-75 year-old participants;
4) characterize the differential impact of APOE2 and 4 allelic dose, other genetic and non-genetic factors
suggested to be involved in the protection from AD, and their interactions on our preclinical A,T,N,I
endophenotypes in 76-90 year-old APOE4 HMs and heterozygotes (HT) who remained CU despite their genetic
risk; 5) further inform the design and size of novel 12- and 24-month prevention trials using imaging, CSF, and/or
BBB endpoints; and 6) demonstrate the value of promising BBBs (including plasma Aβ42/40, p-tau217, and
neurofilament light [NfL]) in these endeavors. We will extensively share 7) annually updated data and biological
samples and 8) motivated research participants with common and rare APOE genotypes, including APOE4 HMs
at particularly high AD risk, understudied APOE2 HMs at particularly low AD risk, older CU APOE4 HMs and
HTs, and those with APOE Christchurch and other potentially protective mutations in APOE's LDLR/HSPG
binding domain; 9) complement our other cohorts in important ways; and 10) provide a foundation for a wide
range of projects (including a planned “Preclinical APOE Consortium”). This project is designed to investigate
the roles of APOE, other genetic and non-genetic factors, and their interactions in the detection, tracking,
predisposition to, protection from, and potential treatment and prevention of AD, support a wide range of
complementary studies, accelerate the evaluation of prevention and future APOE-modifying therapies, and help
our Alzheimer's Prevention Initiative (API) trials find effective AD prevention therapies before 2025."

Migraine is a painful, chronic neurological disorder that represents the second most disabling illness worldwide.
Two of the mechanisms that to contribute to migraine pain are immune cell activation and calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP) signaling. This proposal investigates the connection between these two mechanisms. Cortical
spreading depression (CSD), thought to underlie the aura that precedes migraine attack in a subpopulation of
migraineurs, is associated with increased meningeal macrophage activation. Macrophages can activate
meningeal primary afferent neurons and promote migraine pain through release of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
which are increased in patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during migraine. CSD also increases CGRP synthesis
and release, and single-cell RNA sequencing data support the expression of CGRP receptor subunit mRNA in
mouse meningeal immune cells. Elevated CGRP in patient plasma and CSF and the efficacy of CGRP receptor
antagonists as migraine therapies support the central role of CGRP in the development of migraine pain.
However, the mechanism of action of these drugs is incompletely understood. Given the effect of CSD on
immune cell activation and CGRP release, the presence of CGRP receptor on immune cells, and the use of
CGRP receptor antagonists to treat migraine, I hypothesize that the efficacy of CGRP receptor antagonists
is mediated by their ability to inhibit the activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in the meninges.
In a set of experiments described under three specific aims, I will use anatomical (Aim 1), functional (Aim 2),
and behavioral (Aim 3) approaches to test my hypothesis in the context of a minimally invasive model of migraine
with aura (optogenetic spreading depression, OSD). I will characterize OSD-dependent changes in CGRP
receptor expression in meningeal immune cells using fluorescent in situ hybridization and RT-qPCR (Aim 1). I
will assess the ability of CGRP receptor antagonists to prevent OSD-induced changes in macrophage
morphology and phenotype consistent with activation using real-time in vivo two-photon microscopy (Aim 2A)
and flow cytometry (Aim 2B). Finally, I will assess the contribution of macrophage CGRP receptors to OSD-
induced pain behavior using a selective depletion strategy (Aim 3). The outcomes of these experiments may not
only reveal a mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy of CGRP antagonists but potentially novel targets
and mechanisms to improve existing migraine therapies. In completing this proposal, I will develop valuable
technical skills and receive rigorous intellectual training necessary to becoming an independent investigator, and
I have assembled a team of expert scientist and clinician mentors to help ensure my success. Thus, this
fellowship will allow me to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an academic neurologist-scientist working at
the intersection of pain research and clinical neurology."

Wrist osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent, debilitating condition; however, limited attention has focused on the
scaphotrapeziotrapezoid (STT) joint. The STT is positioned on the radial side of the wrist, spanning both rows
of carpal bones and bridging the thumb and wrist joints. STT OA impacts between 15% and 24% of adults over
45 years of age, with increased prevalence and incidence given advancing age and female sex. However,
compared to hand joints, the STT has received limited diagnostic and therapeutic attention. The wrist is
anatomically complex: the number, unique geometries, small size, and close proximities of carpal bones pose
challenges for diagnostic imaging and guiding evidence-based surgical interventions. Due to intricate carpal
interrelationships, a strong biomechanical foundation of normal STT function during motion and under loading
is critical for tailoring interventions that remedy symptomatic STT OA without compromising the remainder of
the carpus or thumb. Thus, there is a need to understand the complex interplay between carpal bones during
motion in unaffected participants. Specifically, there is a need to measure bone motion dynamically to
understand the relationships between carpal bones during various motions of the wrist and hand under
different loading conditions. 4DCT (3DCT over time) yields a time series of image volumes captured during
motion with high spatial and temporal resolution, offering the exciting capability to capture bones dynamically.
Interosseous proximity distributions, a proxy for pressure, and centers of closest proximity will be used to
describe the joint relationships as a function of motion and loading, conferring an in-depth understanding of the
STT joint in both unaffected and pathological states. Further, the magnitude and variability of joint space and
shape at each STT articulation have not been rigorously quantified. Statistical shape modeling (SSM) and
machine learning of STT carpal bones collected from unaffected and pathological STT joints will allow us to
elucidate the interactions between interacting geometries of articulating surfaces during motion and bone
morphology. Our study aims to understand STT arthrokinematics in normal and pathological conditions in the
following aims. Aim 1: Quantify STT arthrokinematics during unresisted and resisted wrist and thumb motions,
separately, in participants without wrist OA and quantify normal variations in STT morphology. Aim 2: Quantify
STT arthrokinematics during unresisted versus resisted activities in patients with early-stage STT OA using
4DCT and compare 3D morphologies of unaffected and pathologic STT joints. 4DCT data elucidate motions
and loads that stress the joint, while morphologic data indicate sites of structural change. A parallel analysis
will allow us to define structure-function interactions at the STT joint. The Aims will culminate in a
comprehensive view of how STT loading impacts arthrokinematics in participants with and without OA. An
integrative understanding of morphology and the role of load in provocative maneuvers will enhance our
understanding of this complex joint, promoting biomechanically motivated diagnostic and treatment strategies."

Pancreatic cancer is almost invariably associated with the presence of an oncogenic, hyper-activated form
of the KRAS gene. Oncogenic KRAS mutations are present in most human Pancreatic Intraepithelial
Neoplasia (PanIN). Expression of oncogenic Kras in the pancreas epithelium of genetically engineered
mouse models (GEMM) mimics human carcinogenesis, and provides a system to study early stages of the
disease within the context of an intact microenvironment. The onset of pancreatic carcinogenesis requires
dedifferentiation of epithelial cells to a duct-like, progenitor-like cell that is susceptible to oncogenic
transformation. During this process, and throughout the progression of PanIN and cancer, the
microenvironment surrounding the lesions is reprogrammed by tumor cells and, in turn, promotes
carcinogenesis. Among the most abundant components of the PanIN and pancreatic cancer
microenvironment are myeloid cells, including macrophages, granulocytes and several populations of
immature myeloid cells. We have previously shown that myeloid cells are required for the onset of
carcinogenesis, as they promote acinar cell dedifferentiation and sustained proliferation of early lesions.
Further, in advanced disease, myeloid cells inhibit T cell mediated anti-tumor immune responses.
However, myeloid cells can have the opposite effect, promoting tissue repair and remodeling rather than
carcinogenesis. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the crosstalk between tumor cells and myeloid
cells during the onset, progression and maintenance of pancreatic carcinogenesis. Using a combination
of human patient samples and genetically engineered mouse models, as well as in vivo, in vitro and in
silico approaches, we propose to map myeloid cell populations and functional status in the healthy
pancreas, in PanIN, and in pancreatic cancer in human and mouse (Aim 1); define the function of myeloid
cells at different stages of carcinogenesis (Aim 2); and reprogram myeloid cells to prevent/treat pancreatic
cancer (Aim 3). Together these aims will advance our understanding of key cellular interactions that
regulate pancreas carcinogenesis, and identify and test new combination therapy approaches for this
disease."

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, which partly explains differences in prognosis, treatment response,
and metastasis between patients. Breast cancer is classified into histological subtypes (ESR1+;PGR+/-, HER2+,
and “triple-negative” (TNBC)), which are prognostic and predict responsiveness to hormonal and HER2-targeted
therapies. Of these subtypes, TNBC is associated with a worse prognosis and lacks a targeted therapy. The
lethality of TNBC is largely attributed to its aggressiveness and to resistance to traditional therapeutics, especially
as metastases. TNBC show substantial inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity, with phenotypically and
molecularly distinct tumor cell subpopulations existing within a single tumor. A rare subpopulation of cells known
to have intrinsic resistance to chemo- and targeted therapies are called tumor-initiating cells (TICs) (a.k.a. cancer
stem cells). TICs have the ability to self-renew and recapitulate clonally-derived cellular hierarchies upon
generation of a new tumor. Metastasis-initiating cells (MICs), thought to be derived from TICs, possess similar
phenotypic properties to TICs, but are also capable of seeding tumors at distant sites. Current chemotherapies
target the bulk of a lesion, but in many cases, do not effectively eliminate TICs resulting in metastatic recurrence
years after initial treatment. Cell surface markers and signaling reporters have been used to study TICs.
However, such markers are neither unique to TICs nor phenotypically stable, and there is no established method
to lineage trace TICs as they undergo cell state changes. As a result, studying TICs has been a significant
challenge. To address this issue, we have developed a novel Tamoxifen-inducible, Cre recombinase-dependent,
STAT3 signaling-specific lentiviral lineage-tracing (LT) system that will allow us to identify TICs in primary tumors,
to probe their behaviors and phenotypes, and to identify candidate genetic vulnerabilities. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that a subset of STAT3 signaling TICs in some TNBC tumors represent
MICs, which possess a distinct transcriptional program that can be targeted to eliminate TICs and
improve response to chemotherapy. In Aim 1, we will clarify whether STAT3 signaling TICs represent the
MIC population. In Aim 2 we will determine whether STAT3 signaling TICs in the primary tumor express distinct
genes that can be targeted to prevent tumor progression. The results of this proposal will have a positive impact
on the field as it will uncover the role of STAT3 signaling TICs in metastasis and identify genetic vulnerabilities
that may be targeted to eliminate TICs and improve chemotherapy response. The identification of new
therapeutic targets that eliminate the TIC population can improve clinical outcomes for TNBC patients."

In the present proposal we will investigate new tissue processing protocols designed to preserve DNA, as well
as the morphology. We will preserve, process, and make available human ear tissue to inner ear basic
researchers they will be able to compare with their animal models. We have experience using high-resolution
advanced imaging techniques to the postmortem temporal bones, and also the membranous structures of the
inner ear. We propose to develop and apply these imaging techniques systematically and to correlate the
imaging findings with the temporal bone histopathology aiming to visualize structures with non-destructive
techniques. In Specific Aim 1) we will serve as part of a collaborative network providing technical services for
procuring, preparing, sectioning, and distributing high-quality human inner ear tissues aiming to increase
interest in the use of human inner ear tissues for basic scientists. We will continue to procure post- mortem
temporal bones aiming to minimize post-mortem times and will facilitate and reach out to additional prospective
researchers through the collaborative network and through meetings and provide human inner ear tissues of
high-quality. We will create hematoxylin and eosin digital shareable library with our archive of temporal bones,
and this library will be shared through the National Temporal Bone Registry to scientists. We will disseminate
protocols for temporal bone collection, processing, and inner ear tissue processing and provide hands-on
instruction on these protocols on demand and via zoom conferences. In Specific Aim 2, we will develop new
tissue collection and processing techniques for temporal bones by using animal temporal bones to develop
techniques which preserve DNA, mRNA and proteins and preserve morphology. We aim to develop new tissue
processing protocols which will allow for the use of immunofluorescence, DNA extraction and sequencing, and
the application of RNAScope, a powerful in situ hybridization tool. A new protocol will be developed to further
optimize sequencing the DNA from the extracted DNA using temporal bones specimens to correlate the gene
sequencing with the histopathology. In Aim 3. We will improve temporal bone inner ear visualization using
novel non-destructive imaging techniques which we will correlate with histopathology. In Aim 4, we will develop
a deep learning-based stain transformation framework to visualize specific anatomical structures such as the
spiral ganglion neurons to obtain accurate histopathological analysis."

 Inflammation is the body's response to tissue damage, including brain tissue after stroke. Stroke is one
of the leading causes of death and disability, affecting more that 795,000 Americans per year. A majority of
strokes are ischemic strokes, where blood flow to the brain is obstructed. Most therapeutic interventions restore
blood flow, but these therapies have a limited time frame in which they are effective. Moreover, some patients
do not improve even with blood flow restoration. One likely explanation for the limited therapeutic benefit of blood
flow restoration after stroke is the secondary damage caused by the acute inflammatory response. This is the
so-called, “ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.” Therefore, further understanding and characterization of the
inflammatory response to stroke is critical to the development of new therapeutic interventions.
 Following an ischemic stroke, brain blood vessels respond to inflammatory signals and recruit leukocytes
to the area of damage. Neutrophils (PMN) are the earliest responders to tissue damage in the central nervous
system (CNS). Like other leukocytes, PMN interact with adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface and
undergo transendothelial migration (TEM), squeezing between endothelial cells and migrating into the tissue bed.
TEM is important because it is essentially irreversible, committing the cell to extravasation.
 Our research shows inhibition of TEM significantly reduces stroke infarct size in acute stroke, however
the mechanism connecting TEM blockade to a reduction in infarct size is unknown. We show that blocking TEM
alters the spatiotemporal distribution of leukocyte infiltration and extravasation across the ischemic core and
penumbra but does not change the total number of leukocytes recruited to infarcted region. Analysis of the
leukocyte composition showed PMN are the major infiltrating leukocyte type in acute stroke. These findings
suggest that modulating PMN infiltration pattern rather than reducing total leukocyte recruitment may have a
protective effect in stroke. We seek to understand the mechanisms by which myeloid cell TEM blockade results
in reduced stroke infarct size and the effect of specifically interfering with PMN extravasation on stroke outcomes.
 To understand effect of TEM blockade following I/R, our first aim will identify how inhibition of TEM during
I/R injury in acute stroke alters the immune landscape of the stroke microenvironment. Our studies will identify
differences between in leukocyte types over time across ischemic brain regions and differences in the cytokine
profile due to TEM blockade. Our second aim will determine the therapeutic effect of blocking leukocyte
extravasation in comparison to selective PMN depletion following I/R. Our studies will be conducted at different
time points after reperfusion, identifying the effect of inhibition on brain pathology, and mouse motor function.
PMN extravasation will be inhibited through two methods: use of TEM-blocking antibodies and the selective
depletion of PMN. Completion of these studies will provide insight into the mechanisms regulating PMN response
to I/R injury and potentially identify a therapeutic intervention that can be used at the relevant time frame."

 The physiological and functional properties of adipose tissue differ between females and males, which
leads to differences in obesity and metabolic syndrome risk between the sexes. While the gonadal hormones
contribute to these physiological sex differences, the Reue lab has demonstrated that the presence of XX or XY
sex chromosomes further impacts adipose development and function in a sex-dependent manner. Specifically,
the presence of two X chromosomes causes higher body weight and adiposity compared to XY animals. When
two X chromosomes are present, genes on one X chromosome are inactivated to normalize gene expression to
XY cells. However, a subset of these X chromosome genes escape inactivation resulting in higher expression in
XX cells compared to XY cells. This leads to the hypothesis that higher X chromosome gene dosage impacts
sex differences in adiposity. We identified two X chromosome genes, Kdm5c and Kdm6a, that impact adiposity
in vivo by altering preadipocyte and mature adipocyte cellular function, respectively. Reduction of Kdm5c gene
dosage in preadipocytes decreased body weight and adiposity, while reduced Kdm5c gene dosage in mature
adipocytes had no impact on body weight or adiposity. Conversely, reduction of Kdm6a gene dosage in mature
adipocytes reduced body weight and adiposity. Both Kdm5c and Kdm6a encode histone demethylase enzymes
that modify chromatin structure to regulate gene expression across the genome. Thus, the combined actions of
KDM5C in preadipocytes and KDM6A in mature adipocytes may coalesce to impact total adiposity in XX animals.
The proposed studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which KDM5C and KDM6A influence sex differences in
adiposity and metabolism through studies of mouse models with altered gene dosage, and in cultured adipocytes
to identify KDM5C and KDM6A genomic targets. There are three Specific Aims: 1. Uncover physiological
mechanisms by which Kdm6a dosage alters adiposity in vivo. 2. Identify KDM5C and KDM6A genomic targets
in white adipose tissue. 3. Determine the contribution of Kdm5c and Kdm6a gene dosage to weight gain and
increased adiposity in mouse menopause models. Completion of the proposed studies will significantly improve
our understanding of physiological and molecular mechanisms that regulate sex differences in obesity and
metabolic disease.
 The proposed research and training plan will prepare me to transition into an independent investigator
position with a research emphasis on understanding genetic mechanisms driving sex differences in metabolism.
The training in sex differences and adipose tissue biology research in the Reue lab will complement my prior
research experience in metabolic disease and gene regulation to achieve my career goals. The extensive
resources available within the UCLA research environment will further promote my professional development to
accelerate my path to independence as an academic scientist. Importantly, the proposed research provides a
foundation for my independent research, with an emphasis on Kdm6a, as I transition into independence."

 The mission of the 4th Annual Immune Modulation and Engineering symposium, which will be held at
Drexel University on Dec. 7-9, 2022 is to bring together researchers in biomedical engineering and basic and
translational immunology to advance the rapidly emerging field of immune engineering. The speakers and
attendees represent leaders in this field, with expertise in collaborating across disciplines to generate innovative
solutions to treat cancer, infectious disease, immunological disorders and major injuries by modulating the
immune system. The major objectives of this symposium are to provide a forum for the sharing of cutting edge
ideas in immunomodulation, to stimulate cross-disciplinary collaborations, to introduce the next generation of
scientists to this new field, and to identify challenges and opportunities to advance new and innovative
technologies.
 Philadelphia is a prime location to host this event, as it is a recognized hub for immune modulation and
engineering, with a thriving community comprising academic, entrepreneurial, and industry partners. The variety
of research within Philadelphia is a microcosm of that which exists throughout the world, and the field of immune
engineering and modulation is certainly diverse – encompassing topics which span from molecular engineering
to clinical translation. In order to cover this broad spectrum of research, we propose to develop a series of four
concentrations within the symposium with each concentration including two sessions of keynote talks from a
diverse lineup of speakers. These concentrations include: cancer immunology & cell delivery, immunoregulation
of injury and disease, nanomedicine and synthetic biology, and regenerative medicine and immune tissue
engineering.
 We are committed to hosting an annual symposium that is of the highest quality while also showcasing
the diversity in our fields. In support of this goal, this year will feature the inaugural Diverse Perspectives in
Immune Engineering opening reception, which will showcase and celebrate the value of diverse team in this field.
The organizing committee represents diverse representation in terms of gender, ethnicity, career stage, and
scientific discipline. Similarly, we have selected speakers who are current or future leaders in the field of immune
engineering who are also diverse in their make-up and background. Throughout the planning stages we will
continue to seek input from our colleagues who represent persons from disadvantaged backgrounds, those with
disabilities, and other underrepresented groups in science, and make every attempt to recruit participants from
diverse backgrounds. Finally, we will help attendees identify resources for child and family care in the vicinity of
the symposium, and we will make it clear that infants are welcome at the symposium."

10930800,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Telomere homeostasis is critical for cellular replicative capacity and human health. Telomeres shorten with
cellular replication and when critically short, trigger senescence and halt cell division. Inherited mutations in
telomere maintenance genes are associated with severe hematopoietic disorders including childhood-onset
bone marrow failure, aplastic anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as non-hematopoietic conditions
including liver cirrhosis and pulmonary fibrosis. These diseases are collectively referred to as telomere biology
disorders (TBDs). Treatment for TBDs is centered on supportive care and bone marrow or organ transplant
which often have poor outcomes and leave patients at risk for other disease manifestations. New approaches to
therapeutically lengthen telomeres and treat TBDs are needed. In order to identify novel pathways controlling
human telomere length, we recently performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen with a telomere length
readout. In addition to identifying known telomere maintenance genes, we identified an association between
several nucleotide metabolism genes and telomere length. Recent human genome wide association studies
have also connected nucleotide metabolism genes and telomere length in blood cells. Preliminary experiments
performed in our laboratory demonstrate that both genetic and small molecule perturbations of nucleotide
metabolism can rapidly and robustly alter telomere length in human cells, including induced pluripotent stem
cells derived from patients with TBDs. However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps both in the mechanisms
underlying this effect, and whether manipulating nucleotide metabolism could alter telomere maintenance in the
hematopoietic system, which could be therapeutically useful. Here, we aim to uncover how nucleotide
metabolism perturbations alter telomere length in human cells, including in vitro and in vivo models of human
hematopoiesis. This study consists of two aims to investigate: (1) how altering nucleotide metabolism genes
impacts telomere maintenance, and (2) how small molecule manipulation of nucleotide metabolism alters
telomere homeostasis, in human cells including primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. For this F30
award, the PI has designed a research strategy and training program that will provide him with: (1) fundamental
expertise in metabolomics, bioinformatics, and telomere biology, (2) an expert group of mentors and
collaborators to promote not only research expertise, but also career-long academic skills including
grantsmanship and scientific communication, and (3) experience performing translation-focused hematology
research in preparation for his career goal as a physician-scientist. This proposal will take place in the rich and
collaborative Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital research environments. Completion of this
work is expected to establish nucleotide metabolism as a critical regulator of human telomere homeostasis, with
therapeutic implications for the treatment of hematopoietic diseases with high unmet need including bone marrow
failure and aplastic anemia, as well as other non-hematopoietic degenerative diseases."
10889913,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are no biomarkers that are currently used in the management of high-grade gliomas.
Therefore, patients are often required to undergo invasive biopsies or surgical resection to
differentiate disease progression from treatment related changes, quantify disease burden and
track the molecular evolution of these difficult to treat cancers. In work performed to date, we
have been able to demonstrate that CSF is a rich reservoir for tumor derived DNA. We are now
expanding upon that work to develop a multi-analyte assay that will incorporate copy number
changes, sub-chromosomal changes and somatic mutations. We anticipate that by looking at
multiple analytes we will be able to improve sensitivity of the assay while also being able to have
a more wholistic understanding of the cancer genotype. The specificity of this multi-analyte assay
will be tested using CSF from individuals without cancer. In the short term, we anticipate that this
approach will allow us to generate personalized biomarkers capable of tracking brain cancers and
providing insights into the tumor genotype, thereby allowing clinicians to make more informed
decisions in real-time. In the long term, we anticipate that we can gain a broader understanding of
the CSF DNA composition in non-neoplastic states, such as multiple sclerosis, neurosarcoidosis
or infection. This could have broad ranging impact on our ability to diagnose and monitor other
disorders impacting the brain."
10764270,"Project Summary
Over the last 20 years, upper limb rehabilitation intervention trials for severe and chronic post stroke
hemiparesis have largely failed to find significant differences in functional improvement between intervention
and control groups. This has resulted in a dearth of treatment options for at least 50% of stroke survivors who
continue to experience deficits which limit their independence in activities of daily living. To remedy this
shortcoming in field of neurorehabilitation, it is necessary to understand the neural mechanisms which are
central to the motor recovery process following a stroke. We can then develop experiments to exploit these
mechanisms with the goal of optimizing treatment efficacy and facilitating increased independence for the
individual.
Our lab recently published a pilot study on individuals with chronic stroke and moderate to severe impairments
in the UL which suggests that bilateral motor priming in combination with task specific training is an effective
treatment option that can benefit people with severe post-stroke hemiparesis. However, the neurophysiological
mechanisms behind the positive behavioral changes remain unknown. This proposed research will use
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) data from an ongoing clinical trial to investigate the impact of bilateral
motor priming on corticomotor excitability and transcallosal inhibition of the ipsilesional and contralesional
hemispheres in people with chronic stroke (Aims 1 & 2) and determine the relationship between changes in
neurophysiological and behavioral measures (Aim 3) to better understand how and why priming is effective.
The proposed work will provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying priming and, more broadly,
illuminate mechanisms of post stoke motor recovery. These results have the potential to improve functional
restoration of the arm and hand thereby improving quality of life for stroke survivors.
This research will be conducted in the Therapeutic Interventions for Neurological Disorders laboratory under
the direction of Dr. Daniel Corcos at Northwestern University’s (NU) department of Physical Therapy and
Human Movement Sciences (PTHMS). The facilities at NU PTHMS provide everything needed to complete this
research successfully including expert personnel, state-of-the-art laboratories, and the necessary equipment.
The training plan as outlined, will include formal and informal educational opportunities, training in data
processing and analysis and support for manuscript preparation and dissemination of findings."
10828345,"Neural circuits are constructed by synapses that connect neurons into vast networks. Although many neural circuits have been characterized, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that build their synaptic architecture remain largely unknown. During synapse formation that establishes the synaptic architecture of neural circuits, bi-directional signaling via trans-synaptic adhesion molecules is thought to control assembly of synapses. Strikingly, genetic changes in trans-synaptic adhesion molecules often predispose to neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that dysfunction of the synaptic architecture of neural circuits contributes to neuropsychiatric disorders, although the nature of these impairments is poorly understood. Our preliminary data show that in hippocampal neurons, formation of subsets of excitatory synapses requires latrophilins (Lphns), a family of three postsynaptic adhesion-GPCRs. Different Lphns mediate establishment of distinct synapses even in the same neuron, suggesting that they are involved not only in constructing synapses, but also in determining their specificity. How Lphns mediate synapse formation, and to what extent their synapse-formation function involves GPCR signaling or adhesive interactions, remains unknown. Moreover, SNPs in the human Lphn3 gene (ADGRL3) downregulate Lphn3 expression robustly. The present application proposes to examine the signaling mechanisms that mediate Lphn-dependent synapse formation, to explore how Lphns determine synapse specificity, and to investigate how changes in Lphn3 expression change synaptic function. Specifically, the proposed experiments will test the overall hypotheses that (1) Lphns control synapse formation and maintenance by a GPCR-mediated mechanism involving locally restricted signaling, that (2) different Lphn isoforms control formation of distinct synapses via sequence-specific differences in their protein interactions and GPCR function, and that (3) changes in Lphn3 expression impair formation of a specific subset of synapses. Three Specific Aims will test these hypotheses, thus targeting key questions that are most relevant for understanding how neural circuits are wired and how impairment of neural circuits alter cognition. Using both mouse and human neurons as a model system, the project will pursue broadly interdisciplinary approaches in both mice and human neurons that range from biophysical studies of ligand-receptor complexes to cell-biological investigations of intracellular signaling to behavioral studies probing for cognitive changes. Thereby, this application will provide insight into how Lphns drive synapse formation in mice, and how decreased expression of Lphn3 predisposes to synaptic changes in human neurons. Addressing these questions is of paramount interest in basic and translational neuroscience because neural circuits that process the brain’s information are constructed by synapse formation, and dysfunction or imbalance of synaptic communication in neural circuits likely underlies the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders."
10854939,"ABSTRACT
 Executive function (EF) improves dramatically during childhood and adolescence, and failures of EF
are associated with both a broad range of negative outcomes and diverse mental illnesses. The brain circuits
responsible for EF are spatially distributed, and include the fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular, and salience
systems. These networks have typically been studied using standardized network atlases, which assume a
straightforward mapping between structural and functional neuroanatomy across individuals. However,
multiple independent efforts in adults using precision functional mapping techniques have recently
demonstrated that there is marked inter-individual variation in functional topography, which is defined as the
spatial distribution of functional networks on the cortex. The over-arching hypothesis of this proposal is that
individual variation in functional topography is a critical determinant of EF in youth. Our collaborative team
recently published the first report of individualized functional networks in children using a cross-sectional
sample (Cui et al., Neuron 2020). In this proposal, we will build upon this initial work by replicating and
generalizing this finding using two large cross-sectional datasets with high-resolution imaging: the Healthy
Brain Network (HBN; n=5,000) and Human Connectome Project: Development (HCP-D, n=1,300). Critically,
we will also leverage the unprecedented resources of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study
(ABCD, n=11,572) to delineate within-subject change in personalized networks. In this proposal, we will first
harmonize these massive data resources using advanced techniques originally developed for statistical
genomics (Aim 1). Next, we will describe how personalized networks evolve with age (Aim 2) and predict EF
(Aim 3). Finally, we will use machine learning tools to discover how the functional topography of personalized
executive networks predict dimensions of psychopathology in a data-driven manner (Exploratory Aim 4).
Throughout, we will adhere to best practices of open science to maximize reproducibility, and ensure that all
processed data, code, and results are openly shared with the neuroscience community. Together, this
research will establish that functional topography is essential for understanding EF, and will motivate trials of
personalized neuromodulatory therapies."
10814867,"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) reprograms host cell gene expression and metabolism during the establishment of latency and the immortalization of B-lymphocytes. The regulatory mechanisms coordinating this reprogramming with EBV latency reflect important events in viral oncogenesis, yet remain poorly understood. We have found that key viral regulators of EBV latency, including the major tegument protein BNRF1 and the EBV Nuclear Antigen EBNA1 coordinate key aspects of purine metabolism during establishment of latency and immortalization of primary B-cells. In this R01, we focus on how EBV reprograms purine metabolic gene expression, and how purine metabolites contribute directly to EBV tumorigenesis. One clue to this coordinate regulation is provided by the viral-encoded tegument protein BNRF1 that shares extensive structural similarity to the purine biosynthetic enzyme FGARAT (also called PFAS) and functions in viral chromatin assembly during primary infection. Orthologues of BNRF1 are found in all gamma herpesviruses, including KSHV ORF75, and share the common function of disarming components of the PML-nuclear body (PML-NB) and its anti-viral functions. We have previously shown that BNRF1 interacts with the histone H3.3 chaperone DAXX and displaces its interaction with the ATP-dependent SNF2-like helicase ATRX to enable selective expression of latency-specific viral genes during primary infection. However, it has not yet been shown how the viral FGARAT homology domain is linked to cellular purine biosynthesis and/or signaling. Using metabolomics mass spectrometry, we provide new preliminary data indicating that the purine biosynthetic pathway is among the most significantly perturbed by EBV during B-cell immortalization. Integrating gene expression (RNA-Seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq), and EBNA1-DNA binding to host chromosome (ChIP-Seq), we identified cellular metabolic genes, including adenine deaminase (ADA), adenosine kinase 4 (AK4), and purinergic receptors P2RY8 and P2RX5 as direct targets of EBNA1 transcriptional regulation during EBV immortalization. We now propose to investigate the mechanisms by which EBV senses and reprograms purine metabolism and how purinergic signaling regulates establishment of EBV latency and host cell transformation. We will test the central hypothesis that EBV coordinately regulates cellular purine metabolism with viral and cellular gene expression during the B-cell immortalization process, and that purinergic signaling is critical for viral latency and oncogenesis. Specifically, we will investigate how EBV regulates expression of purine metabolic genes during primary infection (Aim 1), elucidate how purine metabolism impacts the establishment of EBV latency (Aim 2), and investigate the role of purine metabolism and signaling in B-cell immortalization, immune signaling, and EBV-induced tumorigenesis (Aim 3). These studies will advance our understanding of basic mechanisms coordinating gene expression with metabolism and identify new targets for therapeutic intervention in viral latency and viral-associated cancers."

Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States. Endovascular stroke therapy (EST) has
revolutionized the management of large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS), which accounts
for a disproportionate amount of disability in stroke. While this therapy has been shown to significantly improve
clinical outcomes in multiple clinical trials, these studies nearly all required screening patients with advanced
NeuroImaging such as CT Perfusion (CTP), a modality not available to the majority of community hospitals. As
such, there is a pressing need to for a tool able to identify EST candidates leveraging the infrastructure already
existing in community hospitals. We envision a software-based service to automate the NeuroImaging
evaluation for EST using CT angiography (CTA). We developed and tested a prototype of a novel deep neural
network architecture called DeepSymNet. Our preliminary data indicate that uniquely using CTAs we can
determine (1) the presence or absence of a large vessel occlusion (2) if the extent of ischemic core and (3)
volume of tissue “at risk” (penumbra) is above or below the thresholds used in the clinical trials, when
compared to concurrently obtained results using CTP.
We will pursue our project goal with three aims:
- Aim 1 - Establish one of the largest multi-institution dataset for neuro-imaging research in acute ischemic
stroke. We will acquire a multi-center dataset including imaging and clinical data from 15 hospitals across
Texas and California, from a range of scanners, imaging acquisition protocols, and hospital types (i.e. large
academic and smaller community).
- Aim 2 - Develop interpretable deep learning models to determine the eligibility for EST. We will methodically
test a set of model architectures, data augmentation strategies, loss functions and pre-processing steps based
on DeepSymNet. We will train and test the algorithm against various definitions of infarct core and penumbral
volume based on CTP results. This approach will allow for models adaptable to the everchanging definition of
EST eligibility.
 – Aim 3 - Evaluate the external validity of DeepSymNet-based models on a large multi-center independent
dataset. To accomplish this aim, we will deploy our DeepSymNet software on patient imaging and data from
multiple hospitals, which were not used in the creation of the software. We will also validate our approach of
using CTA alone to determine ischemic core by validating blinded reads of infarct core from CTA source
images performed by expert readers against concurrently acquired CTP results.
Completion of these aims will have a sustained, transformative impact by supporting the creation and
validation of decision support tools readily translatable to the patient bedside in the vast majority of community
hospitals across the country. In doing so, we hope to expand the access to high-quality EST screening to
thousands of additional AIS patients."

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, rapidly progressive, and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease
for which there is no disease-modifying treatment. Recent insights into pathophysiologic mechanisms suggest
a crucial role of deprivation of neurotrophic factors which have been shown to be secreted by mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs). In a recent phase I/II study adipose-derived autologous MSCs were delivered intrathecally
to patients with early MSA utilizing a dose-escalation design. At a dose of 50x106 MSCs, injections were
generally well tolerated, but thickening of cauda equina nerve roots was observed which was either
asymptomatic or associated with low back pain. The rate of disease progression assessed using the Unified
MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) was markedly slower compared to a matched control group. An even more
favorable side effect profile and virtually lack of disease progression was seen in an add-on cohort receiving
25x106 MSCs per injection. Neurofilament light chain, an index of central axonal degeneration, decreased in all
patients receiving that dose. MSC administrations resulted in a marked, dose-dependent increase of
neurotrophic factors in CSF. 2-year survival was significantly higher than observed in natural history cohorts.
Based on these findings we propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled, adaptive design phase II trial of
adipose-derived intrathecal autologous MSCs in MSA with the goal to establish optimal treatment frequency
and simultaneously derive placebo-controlled efficacy and safety data in preparation for a multicenter phase III
trial. Up to 76 adult subjects with MSA will be enrolled. To ensure a homogenous patient population with
comparable rates of disease progression, we will restrict the study to early cases but still fulfilling strictest
diagnostic consensus criteria. Participants will undergo a subcutaneous fat biopsy to derive autologous MSCs,
which are cultured, expanded, and prepared for delivery in Mayo's Cell Therapeutics Lab. In a first phase,
subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive 25x106 MSCs at two different injection intervals (every 6 months
or every 3 months) as the two active arms or lactated Ringer's solution as the placebo arm. A recruitment hold
after half the subjects have been enrolled will allow for an interim futility and efficacy analysis to select the
“winner” active treatment assuming futility criteria are not met. The study will then restart recruiting the second
half of subjects utilizing 2:1 randomization (“winner” active: placebo). Patients undergo clinical assessments at
baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months to derive the primary endpoint, the rate of disease progression assessed
using UMSARS total and a mixed effects regression model. MRI of the head and lumbar spine will be
completed at baseline and 12 months to expand safety data and to assess the rate of atrophy of selected brain
regions using morphometric measures as surrogate markers of disease progression. Spinal fluid before and
after administrations, as well as stem cell product media will be collected to further explore biological properties
and effects of MSCs and to explore selected spinal fluid markers as biomarkers of disease progression."

Patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) experience low oxygen saturation, shortness of breath, low quality
of life, and a short life span (<10 years) following diagnosis. These patients frequently present to emergency
rooms, and many are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), straining the health care system. Despite therapy
with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, prostacyclin analogs, and endothelin antagonists, mortality remains high
and quality of life poor. With no specific drug available for curative treatment, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), a
pulmonary artery-specific vasodilator, is the best option for treating PH without compromising systemic blood
pressure. Current tank-based iNO delivery systems are expensive and available only in operating rooms and
ICUs of established medical centers in developed countries. The need is great for simpler, portable, and less
expensive iNO technologies. During phase 1, a proof-of-concept prototype was developed in partnership with
the University of Alabama at Birmingham. All the proposed goals in phase 1 were met and the technology was
further advanced through several innovations. First, the NO generation method was modified from the original
proposal of producing sustained release NO from its precursor molecule to producing a stock bulk amount in a
single-step chemical reaction to synthesize medical grade NO in a sealed container on demand. This method
will avoid the pitfalls of current NO generation approaches pursued by other companies in which nitrogen dioxide
(NO2, a toxic gas) is converted to NO, or atmospheric air is oxidized to NO by high voltage electric sparks with
subsequent need for extensive purification steps. Second, it is proposed to mix this 100% NO directly with
supplemental oxygen to attain therapeutic doses while reducing co-delivery of NO2 to levels far below FDA safety
limits or diluting NO in inert nitrogen (N2) gas within the device prior to mixing with supplemental oxygen. These
systems avoid the need to dilute NO 1250-fold in N2 gas for storage in compressed cylinders and transport to
hospitals, as is done with current systems. Third, an integrated gas sensor system for NO and NO2 measurement
and electronic control systems for dispensing NO was developed. The assembled prototype is functioning well
and as expected. Based on these encouraging results, iNOvodel, Inc. was formed to license, develop and
commercialize a full-scale product. In Aim 1, focus is centered on developing a fully functional hospital-based
and demonstrating feasibility for a portable iNO devices incorporating an optimized reusable NO-generating
cartridge. Aim 2 seeks to establish the chemical method for generating and storing NO in the cartridge to utilize
on-demand. Aim 3 is directed toward development of noninvasive and invasive interface systems that are
compatible with iNO devices for safe delivery of nitric oxide to patients. Further, the safety of the device to deliver
NO using an in vitro benchtop NO delivery system that simulates the patient NO delivery system will be evaluated
facilitating the pursuit of FDA regulatory approval."

Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is the major complication associated with allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). During the acute phase of this disease, a
restricted set of organs is affected of which the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most clinically
significant. Proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the pathophysiology of intestinal
GVHD, in part, by activating donor T cell populations which subsequently induce tissue damage.
In pre-clinical murine studies, we have identified interleukin 23 (IL-23) as a key inflammatory
cytokine that mediates pathological damage in the GI tract during GVHD. The overall goal of this
proposal is therefore to define the mechanistic pathways by which IL-23 induces inflammation in
the GI tract, and to directly translate these findings into the clinic to examine whether blockade
of this pathway reduces the severity of GVHD in human allogeneic HSCT recipients. Our overall
hypothesis is that IL-23 produced by donor antigen presenting cells (APCs)
induces a proinflammatory environment in the GI tract and that this pathway is a
clinically viable target for the prevention of GVHD in humans. Experiments in
Specific Aim 1 will define the cellular mechanism(s) by which IL-23 promotes inflammation in the
GI tract during GVHD in murine transplant recipients. To address this question, we will identify
the relevant donor APC populations that produce IL-23 and are functionally important for the
induction of inflammation in the colon, examine whether donor APC-derived IL-23 promotes
indirect alloantigen presentation which is a critical pathway for the propagation of GVHD in the
GI tract, and define whether IL-23 production adversely impacts the regulatory arm of the
immune system by deleteriously affecting CD4+ and CD8+ regulatory T cell reconstitution.
Studies in Specific Aim 2 will consist of a phase 2 clinical trial to determine whether
administration of the IL-23p19-specific antibody, tildrakizumab, attenuates the severity of GVHD
in human allogeneic HSCT recipients with underlying hematological malignancies. In addition,
we will perform correlative studies to define the effect of this therapeutic approach on immune
reconstitution and determine whether tildrakizumab is able to mitigate systemic inflammatory
cytokine production that occurs during GVHD. We will also serially examine the microbiome to
delineate whether administration of tildrakizumab preserves microbial diversity that is otherwise
adversely affected during this disease. The overall goal of these studies is to define the
mechanisms by which IL-23 facilitates GVHD in the GI tract and to determine whether blockade
of this pathway constitutes a clinically viable strategy for the prevention of GVHD in humans."
10845707,"RNA silencing is a gene regulatory mechanism by which small RNAs (18-30 nucleotides) and their Argonaute
protein co-factors modulate the expression of both foreign and endogenous mRNAs. Small RNAs play a critical
role in maintaining proper gene expression by identifying fully or partially complementary mRNAs and targeting
them for either transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. The role of RNA silencing in gene regulatory
pathways is conserved across most eukaryotes and is thus of fundamental importance to the developmental and
cellular biology of humans. C. elegans is an excellent system to study RNA silencing because of its short
generation time, its transparency which is ideal for microscopy, and the powerful genetic tools available for
genome manipulation. In C. elegans germ cells, proteins involved in RNA silencing are organized into sub-
compartments of perinuclear condensates, with each sub-compartment playing a unique and critical role. Many
protein factors have been identified that localize to these structures, yet we know little about how they are
organized and assembled. In the first part of this proposal, we will identify factors and conditions that promote
assembly of RNA silencing components into perinuclear condensates. We will further identify the RNAs in each
sub-compartment, with the ultimate goal of dissecting the trajectory of a targeted mRNA through each of its
phases: beginning with transcription, continuing through this assemblage of perinuclear condensates, and
ultimately with translational repression or degradation by the RNA silencing pathway. Because there are ~27 C.
elegans Argonaute proteins, many of which colocalize at P granules, we will next identify the factors contributing
to sorting of small RNA into the appropriate Argonaute proteins. This sorting is critical because many Argonaute
proteins bind different small RNAs from one another, target distinct groups of mRNAs, and can have very
different regulatory effects on these target mRNAs. Finally, we will focus on how protein modifications such as
phosphorylation and methylation can regulate RNA silencing pathways, including affecting localization,
interacting partners, and dynamics of Argonaute proteins and other key factors. Together, the proposed
experiments will uncover the key details of how RNA silencing pathways are organized, how the specificity of
the pathways is defined, and what mechanisms regulate these pathways. This work will lead to a better
understanding of how small RNAs modulate gene expression in healthy cells, which can ultimately be applied to
discerning how changes in these pathways cause misregulation of genes in humans and transition to a disease
state."
10805524,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The development of new medical devices and technologies requires a biomedical engineering (BME)
workforce that is capable of identifying unmet clinical needs and working in teams to develop design solutions.
BME curricula generally attempt to prepare students for such challenges through hands-on projects and team-
based capstone courses, but such experiences often fall short at preparing students for needs identification
and translation of design solutions. Clinical immersion provides a complementary experience to traditional
curricular features, as students in such opportunities observe real-world application of medical devices and
communicate with clinical personnel. Clinics in urban environments present a unique set of issues, including
the challenge of delivering health care to populations that are socially and economically diverse. Our proposed
INdiana Summer Clinical Residency in Innovation for Biomedical Engineers or (IN)SCRIBE Program will
engage undergraduate BME students in a seven-week summer clinical immersion and design experience that
challenges student teams to integrate socioeconomic considerations into clinically-relevant design. Both health
care professionals and biomedical engineers will serve as faculty for the program.
Indiana ranks 41st of the 50 states in overall resident health quality; chronic disease, obesity, smoking, and
infant mortality rates plague our state. Socioeconomic disparities related to these health issues are of particular
concern in cities like Indianapolis, as 39% of its population are people of color and 19% of its residents live in
poverty. However, with the ample resources for medical innovation present in Indianapolis, our clinicians,
researchers, and industry professionals can better engineer solutions that take socioeconomic disparities into
account. Our proposed (IN)SCRIBE Program will train biomedical engineers to be adept at translating urban,
healthcare-related technologies.
The long-term objective of the proposed project is to develop a model program for urban universities to train
biomedical engineers who will contribute to solutions to society's most challenging health care problems.
Specific Aim 1 is to implement the (IN)SCRIBE Program at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis
(IUPUI), in collaboration with the IU School of Medicine. We will immerse undergraduate BME students in
diverse clinical settings, develop student skills and self-efficacy in needs identification and clinically-relevant
design, and create student awareness of socioeconomic disparities in healthcare. Specific Aim 2 is to
determine how the (IN)SCRIBE Program affects undergraduate BME students. We will identify how student
teams articulate consideration of socioeconomic factors in design solutions and document how student teams
pursue design to meet urban health needs beyond the Program.
Successful achievement of the long-term objective and specific aims will result in improved training for
biomedical engineers and better health for all residents in both urban and non-urban areas."
10832645,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The incidence rate of cutaneous melanoma has doubled since 1973, and is increasing more rapidly than any
other cancer. FDA-approved targeted inhibitors and immune checkpoint therapies have high response rates in
melanoma; however, both innate and acquired resistance remain significant issues. Strategies that combine
targeted and immune therapy show promise; however, a comprehensive understanding of the crosstalk
between cancer cells and immune cells is lacking. Our central hypothesis is that tumor intrinsic signaling
modulates the anti-tumor immune response, and elucidation of pathways that drive these interactions can lead
to novel therapeutic strategies. Through the successful completion of the following two aims, we will gain
insight into tumor intrinsic signaling pathways that regulate anti-tumor immunity. In the F99 phase, we are
investigating a novel regulation of the understudied immune checkpoint protein VISTA. VISTA is an inhibitory
immune checkpoint primarily expressed on hematopoietic cells. In a novel finding, we observed that VISTA is
expressed on melanoma cells in patient samples and in cell lines. Its tumor-specific expression promoted
tumor initiation in vivo, associated with an increase in Foxp3+ CD4+ T regulatory cells (Tregs). We
demonstrated that BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) treatment reduced VISTA expression, and BRAFi-induced
upregulation of FOXD3 negatively regulated VISTA transcript levels. BRAF/MEK inhibitors are used clinically,
which motivates us to further investigate the role of VISTA, a BRAF-FOXD3-regulated immune checkpoint
protein, in modulating immune responses. In the first aim, we will test the hypothesis that tumor-expressed
VISTA promotes Treg induction and enhances Treg suppressive function. Tregs can limit the efficacy of
immunotherapy; thus, we will also test the hypothesis that tumor-specific expression of VISTA alters the
response to PD-1 blockade. In the K00 phase, we will broadly investigate cancer cell signaling pathways that
allow cells to evade immune detection during metastasis. Tumor cells employ various mechanisms to depart
from the primary tumor site and colonize new organs. We hypothesize that tumor intrinsic signaling pathways
play a critical role in immune evasion during metastasis. In aim 2, we will use a CRISPR/Cas9 screen in a
spontaneous metastasis model to identify genes that promote metastasis. We will compare results between
immune competent and immune compromised models to determine genes that specifically promote metastasis
when under pressure from the immune system. Completion of these studies will bring valuable insights into the
complex interactions between tumor and immune cells. The training provided in both of these phases will build
a solid foundation in cancer biology, tumor immunology, and metastasis, contributing towards the long-term
goal of conducting research on tumor immunology as an academic principal investigator."
10838568,"The UT Southwestern Center for Translational Medicine's (CTM) KL2 Scholars Program already has a proven
track record for growing a new generation of Scholars who have become leaders in clinical and translational
research (CTR). Our KL2 program, with an ethos of continuous improvement based on metrics and changing
needs, has been a model of unique and centralized CTR training in our Hub. Our training curriculum has been
streamlined and modernized, and the diversity of our Scholars across all important domains has greatly
increased. In the new grant cycle, we will elevate our KL2 program to the next level through innovative
programming and cost sharing of CTSA, institutional and hub resources. We will appoint three new KL2
Scholars per year for a two-year term (ongoing total of six/year). KL2 Scholars will engage in mentored
research training, take formal coursework and short nanocourses on emerging CTR topics, and submit
manuscripts and grant proposals to secure individual career development and/or research grants (K2K and
K2R conversion, respectively) in a timely manner, to minimize the career-disrupting “K-cliff.” Careful program
evaluation will guide us to restructure elements further to increase the diversity of those we train and broaden
the disciplines and institutions from which the Scholars are recruited. The new KL2 plan proposed here is
significant and innovative. We will strategically leverage CTSA core and institutional resources to broaden
the KL2 program's impact and provide CTR training to an expanding pool of biomedical workforce. The four
Aims are integrated through our unique culturally-aware Tiered Mentorship Model, which includes
mentorship by primary and secondary research mentors, program directors, near-peer mentors, and Scholar
self-mentoring. We propose: Aim 1. Ensure personalized research career development, with customization
by a faculty-level Curriculum Navigator and a longitudinal training roadmap; Aim 2. Catalyze collaboration
and innovation by launching team science, community engagement, innovator studios and women in
technology programs; Aim 3. Promote K2R conversion to independent investigators by strengthening
longitudinal K2R progression along the K2R roadmap, creating an Interdiscipinary Sandwich Junior Mentor-in-
Training Program and a CTR-Scientific Management program to address unique needs of junior CTR PIs; Aim
4. Expand and strengthen the diverse CTR investigator pipeline by providing CTR training to existing
underrepresented trainee career development programs. Impact: Institutional resources will be leveraged to
expand the KL2's footprint and enlarge the CTR Scholar community. Rigorous evaluation metrics will be used
to enable us to improve our program iteratively. Our forward-thinking and integrated training paradigm will
greatly expand the number of Scholars armed with the tools for success and empowered to anticipate and
adapt effectively to become CTR leaders of the future."
10828399,"The long-term health impact of COVID-19 remains uncertain. We are already providing post-hospitalization
care for thousands of COVID-19 survivors at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) in New York
City. This study is designed to help our and other medical centers care for COVID-19 survivors by using gold-
standard imaging approaches to describe the major sequelae of severe COVID-19. The possibility of
significant vascular and parenchymal sequelae of severe COVID-19 is suggested by the prominent Alverolar-
arterial gradients observed clinically, plus histopathology confirming substantial endothelial and epithelial
damage. Nonetheless, precise assessments of vascular and parenchymal sequelae in vivo have been limited,
especially for the vasculature, and long-term follow-up to assess recovery or progression is lacking. Our
investigative team has developed and refined a dual-energy computed tomography (CT) protocol to provide
direct measures of the pulmonary vasculature, including pulmonary parenchymal perfused blood volume
(PBV); and, detailed phenotyping of the parenchyma, including ground glass opacity (GGO) textures, which we
have identified by an adaptive multiple features model (AMFM) approach in preliminary work among COVID-19
survivors. In multiethnic cohort studies, we have associated these CT measures with development and
progression of chronic lung diseases. To strengthen our investigation into potential microvascular mechanisms
of COVID-19 lung injury, this application will also test if PBV is associated with biomarkers of inflammation,
hypercoagulability, and complement activation. We will randomly sample 200 adults without a prior diagnosis
of chronic lung disease who were hospitalized for COVID-19 at CUIMC and did not require intubation, plus 100
seronegative controls matched on age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index, and neighborhood. All
participants will undergo contrast-enhanced dual-energy CT, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon
monoxide, spirometry, questionnaires, and phlebotomy for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and biomarkers. These
measures will be performed 3-12 months and 27-36 months post-COVID hospital discharge to accomplish
three specific aims. Aim 1 is to define lung microvascular sequelae of COVID-19. We hypothesize that PBV in
COVID-19 survivors will be lower and more heterogeneous, and that these abnormalities will be associated
with levels of IL-6, CRP, d-dimer, C5a, MBL, and MASP-2. Aim 2 is to define lung parenchymal sequelae of
COVID-19. We hypothesize that there will be greater GGO texture patterns in COVID-19 survivors. Aim 3 is to
explore if COVID-related differences in lung structure and procoagulant biomarkers are maintained up to 3
years after acute illness. We hypothesize that two years following the baseline study visit, parenchymal and
biomarker abnormalities will normalize, but vascular abnormalities will progress. Accomplishment of the Aims
will guide post-COVID care and risk stratification, suggest targets for therapeutic interventions, and inform
policies for risk mitigation and public health in the COVID-19 era."
10829381,"Project Summary
Recent clinical findings implicate de novo mutations in the gene encoding the hyperpolarization-activated
HCN1 cation channel in severe forms of childhood epilepsy. At the same time genome-wide association
studies demonstrate a strong link of the HCN1 locus with schizophrenia. Here we aim to provide a detailed
characterization of the role of HCN1 in normal neural function, and to determine how disease-causing HCN1
mutations perturb neural activity to generate disordered brain function. HCN1 channels are unusual in that they
are activated by membrane hyperpolarization, yet conduct an inward depolarizing Na+/K+ current, and show a
contrasting pattern of subcellular localization in the distinct classes of neurons in which they are expressed.
Thus, the channel is strongly expressed in hippocampal CA1 and neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons, where
it is targeted to the apical dendrites in a striking gradient of increasing density with increasing distance from the
soma. HCN1 is also strongly expressed in parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons (PV INs), where, in contrast
to pyramidal neurons, it is targeted to PV IN axons and presynaptic terminals. Studies of mice with a general or
forebrain-restricted genetic deletion of HCN1 have revealed the important role of this channel as a negative
constraint of hippocampal pyramidal neuron dendritic integration and long-term synaptic plasticity, and of
hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Loss of HCN1 decreases the precision of pyramidal neuron place cell
spatial coding while increasing the stability of spatial representations. In contrast to the well-studied role of
HCN1 in pyramidal neuron function, relatively little is known about the role of HCN1 in inhibitory neurons. This
lack of information prevents a full appreciation as to how HCN1 contributes to both normal brain function and
disease, given the importance of inhibitory neurons, and PV INs in particular, in these processes. In addition,
because HCN1 was deleted from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the HCN1 knockout mice examined
to date, the extent to which the reported alterations in learning and memory and in vivo firing properties reflect
the role of HCN1 in excitatory versus inhibitory neurons is unclear. In our application we propose to examine in
detail how HCN1 contributes to PV IN function at the cellular, in vivo network, and behavioral levels. We will
thus explore: the role of wild-type HCN1 in regulating PV IN intrinsic excitability and presynaptic function (Aim
1); how PV IN function is perturbed by epilepsy-associated HCN1 mutations (Aim 3a); how selective deletion of
wild-type HCN1 from PV INs alters the in vivo coding of spatial information, as well as spatial and non-spatial
memory behavior (Aim 2); and the paradoxical effects of certain anti-epileptic drugs to increase seizures in
mice harboring epilepsy-associated HCN1 mutations (Aim 3b). Our goal in these studies is to both provide
basic information about how a given channel expressed in a specific class of neurons contributes to brain
function, and to provide new insights into disease mechanisms that may suggest new therapeutic approaches."
10833552,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Aging is a significant risk factor for the onset of several degenerative diseases, including spinal or
intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and associated chronic back pain. IVD degeneration and chronic back
pain are top neurological disorders and substantial financial burden, but with no therapy or cure. Each IVD has
a central core of nucleus pulposus (NP), surrounded by orthogonal layers of annulus fibrosus (AF), together
sandwiched between a pair of endplates that connect the IVD to the vertebral bodies. Much remains to be
learned about the critical regulators of IVD growth, maturation, and maintenance, and whether their loss with
age results in IVD pathologies. We will use conditional genetic mouse models, lineage tracing, heterochronic
IVD organ culture, analysis of human disc samples, and unbiased approaches of high throughput
transcriptomics to identify crucial developmental regulators', including sonic hedgehog (SHH), in IVD
maintenance to fill in these gaps. Our central hypothesis is that Shh-expression by the NP cells is essential for
growth and maturation of the IVD, and its age-related loss leads to the IVD pathologies. The expression of
SHH signaling ligand by the notochord is crucial for embryogenesis. Previously, we showed that postnatal NP
cells continue to express SHH, and SHH signaling regulates NP cell proliferation and ECM production by NP
and AF. Though all NP cells are descendants of Shh-expressing notochord cells, our preliminary data reveals
that most of them turn-off Shh expression after birth. Besides, age-related decline in Shh expression is
associated with terminal differentiation of NP cells into multinucleated syncytium and subsequent loss along
with the declined expression of ECM proteins that are important for IVD function. Our preliminary data also
show that conditional targeting of Shh in adult mice accelerates IVD aging, along with the loss of NP cells,
providing the logical premise for this new project. These data indicate that SHH signaling is crucial; however,
we do not know its precise function during growth and maturation and whether it is critical for aging IVDs. Aim
1 will test the hypothesis that SHH is a critical signaling pathway and its downstream regulators play a distinct
role during infancy and maturation, and its loss causes IVD pathologies. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis
that Shh-expressing NP cells are the progenitor cells, and the stochastic expression of Shh regulates all NP
cells' molecular heterogeneity. Aim 3 will investigate the beneficial effects of SHH signaling for delaying aging.
We expect that the completion of this study will provide insights into the role of SHH as a critical regulator of
growth and maturation of the IVD and identify avenues for targeting such molecules to reverse or delay the
aging process and improve the quality of life of the aging population."

3 Scholars per year for 2-3 years by leveraging a wealth of biomedical resources across the Washington
University School of Medicine campus. As we have done for the past 26 years, the long-term objective of our
Center is to develop Scholars who focus their research efforts on pediatric disease-oriented biology by
applying recent advances in the basic sciences, including developmental biology, cell biology, immunology,
genetics/genomics, and systems biology. The specific aims of this proposal include: (1) providing protected,
mentored research experiences with well-established investigators encompassing a wide range of disciplines
across Washington University School of Medicine and within the Department of Pediatrics; (2) obligatory
educational programs in laboratory management, scientific rigor, statistics, grantsmanship and responsible
conduct of research; (3) personalized coursework based on each Scholar’s area of investigation (e.g.,
bioinformatics, statistics, advanced imaging); (4) ongoing feedback to the Scholars, mentors and CHRC
leadership; and (5) promoting the development of Scholars who are women and are from communities
traditionally underrepresented in medicine and science. The program has a stellar track record, by far
exceeding national benchmarks (”K12 to K08/23” conversion rate of 73% and an outstanding “K to R
conversion” rate of 60%; national average <38%), and will ultimately close the knowledge gap between basic
scientists and pediatric clinicians. Gary A. Silverman, MD, PhD, will continue to serve as Program Director, and
David Hunstad, MD, will continue to serve as Training Director. The CHRC and its Scholars will utilize dozens
of institutional state-of-the-art core facilities that provide, for example, genomic and metagenomic sequencing,
transcriptomics, metabolomics, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, cryo-EM and other advanced imaging,
CRISPR genome editing and animal model development, to facilitate the study of pediatric disease states. The
long-term goals of the CHRC are being realized as its Scholars contribute to our understanding of child health
and disease for decades to come, while evolving into the next generation of scientific leaders, role models, and
mentors for subsequent generations of pediatric physician-scientists."

The overarching goal of the Emory Stimulating Access to Research in Residency R38 (Emory R38) program is
to leverage the rich infrastructure and the interdisciplinary research environment at Emory University to provide
> 12 months of clinical and translational research training for resident physicians in the field of infectious
diseases, allergy, microbiology, and immunology. The long-term goal is to expand the pool of physician
scientists engaged in these areas of research. We will foster an Emory R38 specific mentoring program
tailored to the training needs of resident physicians; and build a systematic approach for identifying and
recruiting a diverse cohort of resident physicians into the program. The Emory R38 program will attract trainees
from our Internal Medicine Residency Categorical Track with interest in pursuing a career as a physician
scientist focused on clinical and translational research. As a result of the size and diversity of the Emory
residency training program, we have a highly competitive pool of eligible candidates whose research interests,
skills and career development will be significantly enhanced by a program that provides individualized didactic
and mentored research training by an outstanding multidisciplinary team of preceptors and will provide
sufficient (80% protected) time to gain skills and expertise in clinical and translational research. Research
training will be personalized, and the duration of training will be 12 months or more depending on the resident’s
training needs and future career plans, while fulfilling all requirements for clinical board certification. The
research training plan, which has been approved by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM), will be
spread across the last 2 years of the Internal Medicine Residency in protected blocks of >3 months; after the
3rd year, trainees will also serve 12 months in the Research Chief Resident position to focus on mentored
research training to complete their research projects prior to beginning fellowship training. Research training
addressed by the selected seminars, workshops, and short coursework for the Emory R38 program will include
the fundamentals and ethics of clinical and translational research, practical research skill acquisition, effective
communication, time management, understanding research funds flow in an academic health center, building a
successful research team, job negotiation, identifying grant opportunities, and navigating an IRB and/or animal
protocol, as appropriate for the research project. Preceptors with mentoring experience and NIH-funded
research projects in broad areas of the target fields have been strategically assembled for this program,
including applied immunology and microbiology, disease management, diagnostics, health equity,
therapeutics, and vaccinology. Preceptors are offered mentorship training that includes topics such as practical
research skill-building needed for research supervision and effective mentoring of physician-scientists, aligning
goals and expectations, and mentoring for a diverse and inclusive biomedical research workforce."
10794347,"ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY
In response to a 30-year decline in the number of physician-scientists, attributed to prolonged clinical training,
doubling or tripling of education debt, uncertain grant funding prospects, unclear career trajectories, and a lack
of mentored research opportunities during early clinical training, the NIH started the Mentored ResearchPathway
in Residency R38 program. Residency training, a critical step in physician training, is often carried out by training
programs that do not support physician-scientist development. Significant gaps exist for protected research
time, structured trainingand mentoring, and support to continue researchafter returningto the clinic. The primary
goal of the multidisciplinary Duke NHLBI Scientist-Clinician-Investigator Stimulating access to Research during
Residency (Duke SCI-StARR) program is to train a diverse cadre of physician-scientists who will lead the
development, implementation, and evaluation of new clinical modalities to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease
states affecting the heart, lungs, and blood throughout the life-course. Duke NHLBI SCI-StARR trainS residents
across 3 departments: Pediatrics, Medicine, and Surgery in areas along the full biomedical research
continuum (basic/translational, early phase clinical trials and pharmacokinetics, and late phase clinical
trials and outcomes) with a theme of improving health over the life course. The program will consist of four
training aims: 1) comprehensive didactics covering basic, translational, and clinical research and professional
development; 2) development and completion of a research project and an individualized career development
plan; 3) establishment of a track record of scholarly activity; and 4) eligibility for board certification and
continuation to subspecialty training. Duke NHLBI SCI-StARR will be led by an Executive Committee (EC) of
MPIs Mai K. ElMallah, MD (Pediatrics), Scott Palmer, MD, MHS (Medicine), and David Harpole, Jr., MD
(Surgery), and an Expanded EC of Residency Program Directors and Program Coordinators, capitalizing on a
team of 33 multi-departmental, multi-disciplinary, well-funded, and experienced faculty preceptors. This
application requests support for three Resident-Investigators each year with each trainee to be supported for 18-
24 months of research. Upon completion of the program, these individuals will be capable of transitioning to
research-intense fellowship training, successfully competing for extramural funding to support a path to
independence as physician-scientists, and becoming the next generation of physicians leading and mentoring
trainees in clinically-oriented research of disease states affecting the heart, lungs, and blood. Achievement of
the program's objectives will fulfill urgent medical needs for: 1) more full-time academic physician-researchers
and mentors in medical schools throughout the country and 2) innovations and clinical translation of novel
strategies to improve the health of individuals across the life course."

placing particular emphasis on three major areas of pediatric research, namely Molecular Genetics,
Neurosciences, and Inflammation/Host Defenses. Specifically, this program will support and foster research
training of junior pediatric physician-scientists in cellular and molecular biology, applied genetics and
genomics, animal models of human disease, and translational research. The specific long-term goals and
objectives of this program are: (1) to provide junior pediatric physician scientists with research experiences and
technical training that they will then apply to current and future studies of the genetics and functional basis of
diseases that impact broadly on children’s health; (2) to provide junior pediatric physician-scientists with a
systematic cirriculum of formal instruction in fundamental skills that are necessary for the development of a
successful academic research career; (3) to provide a unique environment for junior pediatric physician-
scientists to study gene funciton across the biological spectrum from regulation at the molecular level thorough
to whole organism physiology; (4) to provide junior pediatric physician-scientists with an opportunity to acquire
new, innovative and state-of-the-art scientific research expertise in molecular and cellular biology, physiologic
genomics, neuroscience and translational research to bridge the gap between basic science research and
clinical pediatric medicine; (5) to attract the most talented junior pediatric physician-scientists and to recruit,
develop and train minority and women as independent investigators. To achieve these aims we have recruited
a cadre of senior faculty Mentors from diverse departments and units throughout the Department of Pediatrics,
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the College of Medicine. Oversight of the program will be achieved
through regularly scheduled meetings of an Internal Advisory Committee and presentations by each of the
Scholars. In addition, an External Advisory Committee will meet annually to review the program, assess
progress of the Scholars, and provide feedback regarding the effectiveness and operations of the program.
This program will ultimately improve the health and well-being of children through innovative research fostered
by the development of newly trained and highly effective pediatric physician--scientists."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with profound impacts on
memory and cognition that currently affects more than 6 million adults living in the United States.
Treatment options for Alzheimer’s remain limited, with high rates of failure in AD drug trials.
Drug repurposing to identify new uses for existing drugs offers several advantages over traditional drug
development, including higher success rates, lower costs, shorter timelines, and increased assurance
of safety. Furthermore, drugs with genetic support of efficacy have been found to be twice as successful
in clinical development.
This work leverages new developments in genetics and informatics to propose two independent
approaches to identify drug repurposing candidates for AD: (1) a virtual transcriptome approach
identifying drugs that can reverse gene expression changes observed in AD, and (2) a Mendelian
randomization approach identifying drugs acting on genes found to be causally associated with AD.
Identified repurposing candidates will be clinically validated using electronic health record (EHR) data
from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, as well as external datasets (clinical data from the NIH All
of Us Research Program Database or claims data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services).
In AIM 1, we will develop a virtual transcriptomic signature for AD using GWAS summary statistics, and
query this signature against large-scale drug perturbation databases. In AIM 2, we will use conditionally
independent genetic variants as instrumental variables to perform Mendelian randomization on AD
GWAS, and evaluate for causal relationships between actionable druggable genes and AD. Both aims
will involve further validation of repurposing candidates using real-world clinical data, which
has seldom been done before. Successful completion of this project will yield novel insights into high-
priority drug repurposing candidates for AD that can be further investigated in randomized clinical trials,
and will establish a high-throughput AD repurposing pipeline integrating genetic, -omics, and
EHR data that may be adapted to other diseases of interest."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and its prevalence is rising alarmingly. It is particularly challenging
to treat persistent AF and to restore normal sinus rhythm with currently available antiarrhythmics. Therefore, novel ion
channel blocking modalities are needed for the development of the next generation of antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapies in
persistent AF. A hallmark of remodeling in the chronically fibrillating atria is the presence of a constitutively active,
parasympathetic stimulation independent acetylcholine sensitive inward rectifier potassium current (IKACh). Constitutively
active IKACh acts as a background inward rectifier conductance and can contribute to the shortening of the atrial effective
refractory period, and consequently to the perpetuation of AF. We demonstrated earlier that IKACh blockade with the
peptidotoxin tertiapinQ, a 21-amino acid synthetic peptide blocker of IKACh originally isolated from the European honeybee
venom, terminates persistent AF. We thus bioengineered, produced and characterized a novel, and potent IKACh blocking
peptibody. Peptibodies are chimeras generated as fusion proteins of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain of the human
immunoglobulin G (IgG1) with a bioactive “warhead” peptide. Peptibodies combine the biologic/therapeutic activity of a
given peptide, with the stability of monoclonal antibodies and are stable and safe molecules that are emerging as viable
clinical therapies. Our IKACh blocking peptibody was constructed as a fusion protein between the Fc fragment of human IgG1
and tertiapinQ linked together by an octaglycine spacer. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that
bioengineered peptibodies designed as potent and bioactive blockers of IKACh are antiarrhythmic in persistent AF. Our goals
are: 1- to delineate the structural determinants for the peptibody’s block of IKACh; 2- to determine the atrial specificity,
electrophysiological safety and therapeutic potential of anti-IKACh peptibodies in a pig model of persistent AF; and 3- to
bioengineer next generation peptibodies that have increased IKACh potency and specificity. Successful accomplishment of
our proposal should be a major step forward in the deliberate, innovative, and rational development of much needed and
effective antifibrillatory agents based on bioengineering approaches that target ion channels important in the mechanism of
a major cardiac disease."

 Diabetes mellitus (DM) induces cerebral vascular dysfunction and impairs the hippocampal neurogenesis,
resulting in cognitive decline. Cerebral angiogenesis couples with neurogenesis. Molecules that mediate the
interaction between cerebral endothelial cells and neural stem cells in particular in DM have not been fully
investigated. Cerebral endothelial cells constitutively release exosomes, which mediate intercellular
communication. Our preliminary data demonstrated that exosomes derived from dysfunctional cerebral
endothelial cells of DM rats communicate with neural stem cells and inhibit neurogenesis. Importantly,
administration of exosomes isolated from cerebral endothelial cells (CE-exo) of healthy adult brain to DM rats
robustly improved cognitive function and minimized DM-induced cerebral endothelial cell dysfunction and DM-
impaired hippocampal neurogenesis. In this application, we therefore, propose to develop cerebral endothelial
exosomes as a mechanism-based therapy for DM-induced cognitive decline in the aged rats. There are three
Aims. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that CE-exo treatment reduces cognitive deficits in the DM rat. Aim 2 tests
the hypothesis that CE-exo treatment improves cerebral vascular patency and integrity, and promotes
neurogenesis in the aged-DM rat. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that engineered exosomes carrying elevated
selective miRNAs have enhanced effects on cerebral vascular function and neurogenesis as well as cognitive
function. These studies will provide preclinical evidence for developing CE-exo as an innovative treatment for
DM-induced cognitive dysfunction."

While significant evidence has demonstrated that obesity increases the risk of metastasis, the molecular
mechanisms by which obesity contributes to the metastatic progression of breast cancer are unclear.
Furthermore, recent research in cancer development and progression has highlighted the role of hypoxia and
dysregulated lipid metabolism. Research from our team and others demonstrate that lipid accumulation, which
is associated with reduced patient outcomes, is greater in metastases compared to primary tumors.
Furthermore, hypoxia, which is increased in obesity in the primary tumor, leads to sustained increase in the
expression of specific genes after reoxygenation, a hypoxic memory. Our results demonstrate that hypoxic
memory results in the expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), which is the rate-limiting step in fatty acid
synthesis, and pyruvate carboxylase (PC), which we have shown provides oxidative stress protection. In
addition, the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is elevated in obesity, enhances the expression
of CPT1A, the rate-limiting step in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) to supply energy. Our preliminary data show that
the expression of these three proteins and their functional consequences of increased fatty acid synthesis and
FAO are elevated in metastases compared to primary tumors. Thus, our preliminary results suggest that
hypoxia may set the stage for dysfunctional lipid metabolism, where increased lipid synthesis and utilization
occur concurrently with a balance towards lipid accumulation. However, the impact of dysfunctional lipid
metabolism in obesity-driven metastasis is unknown despite the supporting evidence that hypoxia and IL-6 are
enhanced in obesity. In the proposed studies, the research team will utilize multiple mouse models of obesity
and metastatic breast cancer to evaluate the mechanistic basis by which hypoxic memory and IL-6 interact to
stimulate obesity-driven breast cancer metastasis. They will test the hypothesis that obesity-associated
increases in hypoxic memory and proinflammatory IL-6 signaling work in tandem to increase FA accumulation
(FASN), FAO (CPT1), and cell survival (PC) to enhance metastases. These hypotheses will be tested through
the completion of the following two aims: 1) determine the impact of hypoxic memory on lipid accumulation in
obesity-driven metastasis, and 2) establish the interaction of hypoxic memory with chronic inflammation in
obesity-driven metastasis. These studies will provide foundational evidence for developing targeted strategies
to mitigate obesity-driven metastatic breast cancer."

Hispanic/Latino (H/L) children and adolescents have a 40% higher death rate than non-Hispanic whites (NHW)
after correcting socioeconomic factors. Recently, we identified a highly increased incidence of deletion of one
IKZF1 allele in H/L children, which provided a biological rationale for the worse prognosis of B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in this population. The very high incidence (29%) makes the deletion of one
IKZF1 allele the most frequent genetic alteration that confers adverse prognosis in B-ALL in H/L children. Thus,
understanding the biological basis for resistance to chemotherapy and developing novel therapies to treat B-ALL
with deletion of one IKZF1 allele will reduce the health disparity in survival for Hispanic/Latino children with ALL.
The IKZF1 gene encodes a DNA-binding protein, IKAROS, which functions as a transcriptional regulator. Our
published data showed that, in B-ALL, IKAROS phosphorylation by the oncogenic Casein Kinase II (CK2)
reduces IKAROS DNA-binding affinity and abolishes its function as a transcriptional regulator. Our new
preliminary data suggest that CK2 impairs the ability of IKAROS to repress transcription of two key genes
involved in the thiopurine pathway, resistance to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) treatment, and relapse: TPMT and
NT5C2. Treatment with CK2-specific inhibitor, CX-4945, restores IKAROS-mediated repression of the TPMT
and NT5C2 genes in primary B-ALL cells from H/L children. In vitro treatment of B-ALL with CX-4945 in
combination with 6-MP exhibits a strong synergistic cytotoxic effect. Our overall hypothesis is that
overexpression of CK2 in high-risk B-ALL of H/L children impairs IKAROS’ ability to transcriptionally repress the
genes that regulate resistance to treatment with 6-MP, and that CK2 inhibition will restore IKAROS function as
a transcriptional repressor of these genes, resulting in increased sensitivity to 6-MP. This hypothesis will be
tested in vivo, using various biological models. We will define the mechanism through which IKAROS regulates
the thiopurine pathway in primary B-ALL cells from H/L children. The effect of increased CK2 expression on
thiopurine pathway and IKAROS function will be analyzed in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), generated from
B-ALL from H/L children. Finally, we will establish the therapeutic efficacy of combination treatment with CK2
inhibitor (CX-4945) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in a preclinical model of B-ALL from H/L children. Results of
the project will provide a novel insight into the regulation of the thiopurine pathway and help develop novel
treatments for high-risk B-ALL in H/L children and reduce childhood cancer health disparities."

Proper chromosome segregation is vital for maintenance of eukaryotic genomes, yet the molecular mechanisms
underlying this fundamental process remain unclear. This process must occur with absolute fidelity as
detrimental aneuploidies result when it goes awry. Aneuploidy is a unifying hallmark of many different cancer
types, where it appears to be a therapeutic vulnerability. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of
chromosome segregation would give insight into how aneuploidy occurs and how it might be prevented. Our
research goal is to understand the regulation and mechanisms of chromosome segregation by probing the
function of protein factors responsible for segregating chromosomes. For proper chromosome segregation to
occur, duplicated chromosomes must become attached to microtubules originating from opposite cell poles.
When a chromosome becomes attached to microtubules from opposing poles in a correct manner, a high force
is generated. By contrast, a chromosome attached incorrectly to microtubules from the same cell pole
experiences low force. Proteins in the kinetochore complex, which forms the attachment between chromosomes
and microtubules, sense and respond to these forces. Kinetochores stabilize “correct” high-force attachments
and destabilize “incorrect” low-force attachments through unknown mechanisms, and this activity is vital for
proper chromosome segregation. Past work had shown that two conserved eukaryotic factors, Stu2 and its
kinetochore receptor the Ndc80 complex (Ndc80c), are required for tension-sensing activity, and we set out to
understand the tension-sensing mechanisms of these factors. Using structural and biochemical means, we
characterized the physical interaction between Stu2 and Ndc80c and showed that these proteins must interact
for proper chromosomes segregation in yeast. These findings are the subject of a recent publication. In this
proposal, we will determine how Stu2 and Ndc80c are regulated to control tension-sensing and we will investigate
the tension-sensing mechanism by these factors. We will analyze the effects of phosphorylation on Stu2-Ndc80c
binding and activity in yeast. Preliminary data showed Stu2 is phosphorylated near the Ndc80c binding site, and
that this phosphorylation may affect Ndc80c binding and tension-sensing. Further topology analysis of the Stu2-
Ndc80c assembly pointed to an additional interaction interface between these factors that is required for cell
viability and possibly tension-sensing. We will also investigate the tension-sensing mechanism of Stu2-Ndc80c
by reconstituting the kinetochore microtubule interface and probing it with biophysical methods. These combined
approaches will reveal important mechanistic details that are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain by other
experimental means. Our past work and preliminary data prime us to be successful in these investigations. Both
Stu2 and Ndc80c are mutated in human cancers, with several mutations found at their binding interface, and
understanding these mechanisms may provide novel treatment strategies. Overall, this work will increase our
understanding of chromosome segregation and how aneuploidy results when this process goes wrong."
10824263,"Project Summary: The overall goal of this project is to provide applicant J. Nicole Bentley, MD appropriate
resources and mentorship to develop skills allowing a path to research independence in the field of
neuromodulation for cognitive disorders. This proposal focuses on the role of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC) in altered cognition in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with simultaneous intracranial cortical and
subcortical recordings during awake deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. Cognitive impairment is a common
non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD), affecting one-quarter of newly diagnosed patients, and more
than 80% of patients over the course of the disease. Despite its prevalence, very few treatment options exist.
Unfortunately, mainstay treatments for motor symptoms of PD such as dopaminergic medications and high-
frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) do not improve and in some instances can even worsen cognitive
symptoms. Recent evidence in PD patients suggests that reduced prefrontal theta frequency oscillatory activity
is associated with impaired cognition, specifically evident in the domain of inhibitory control. Given its dense
connections to basal ganglia and pre-motor areas, neuromodulation of the DLPFC-basal ganglia network could
enhance elements of cognitive dysfunction in PD. Our novel preliminary data shows DLPFC and subcortical
power modulation and phase-amplitude coupling during an intraoperative Simon task measuring inhibitory
control, and that bursting theta-frequency DBS modulates DLPFC theta power. Here we propose studies to (1)
simultaneously record DLPFC and globus pallidus interna (GPi) local field potentials (LFPs) in awake PD patients
during the Simon task, and (2) contrast continuous and intermittent theta stimulation from the DBS electrode at
the GPi to determine the effect on behavioral and electrophysiologic measures. Given the increasing prevalence
of cognitive impairment and the dearth of available treatments, there is an urgent need to foster the development
of clinician-neuroscientists with this interest. As a neurosurgeon with specialization in neuromodulation, Dr.
Bentley is an ideal candidate to serve in this role. She has assembled a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional
team of expert mentors who will provide guidance and support towards the scientific and career development
aims of this proposal. She and her mentors have designed a career development plan consisting of cognitive
neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and signal processing techniques. These training aims will be
combined with the high volume of a tertiary movement disorders functional neurosurgery practice at the
University of Alabama, Birmingham. With the institution’s robust resources in research computing, biostatistics,
engineering, and neurophysiology, this proposal will ensure that Dr. Bentley is well-prepared for progressing to
research independence by the completion of this award."

Over the past five years, the Allen Institute has built two unique in-house pipelines for in vivo electro- and
optical-physiology: together they form the Allen Brain Observatory. We used this observatory to freely and
openly share calcium imaging data from ~60,000 cells from 221 running mice viewing standard visual stimuli;
in October 2019, we will release Neuropixels electrophysiology recordings from ~100,000 cells from 100 mice
under the same conditions, all registered to a common anatomical coordinate system (CCFv3). We wish to
open the Brain Observatory pipeline to the community, enabling theoretical, computational, and experimental
scientists to test sophisticated hypotheses on brain functions in a process analogous to astronomical
observatories that survey the night sky. Our observatory, called OpenScope, will accept, once a year,
experimental proposals from external scientists, which will be reviewed by a panel of leading experts for their
feasibility and scientific merit. The Allen Institute will carry out the selected experiments by following verified,
reproducible, and open protocols for in vivo single- and multi-area two photon calcium imaging and
Neuropixels electrophysiology, making the data freely available to these scientists. Funding for this proposal
will give the entire community access to a modern experimental platform that operates under standardized,
reproducible, and high-throughput conditions. This resource will be particularly attractive to the computational
and theoretical communities with limited access to experimental facilities. Our project has the potential to
transform systems neuroscience by implementing an observatory model that has been tremendously
successful in other scientific fields. By reducing variability in training, imaging and quality control across
animals and experiments and by lowering the barrier to select, test, and validate the best ideas, we hope to
accelerate progress toward an integrated view of neural circuits."
10812994,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite improvements in breast cancer incidence and mortality rates in the general population, breast cancer
incidence rates in Black women have continued to rise and they exhibit the highest breast cancer mortality rate
out of any other racial population. Increased mammographic density has been well established as one of the
strongest, independent breast cancer risk factors. However, to date, there have been very few studies that
have included Black women in our understanding of mammographic breast density, which is a significant
limitation given that Black women are more likely to have denser breasts. Breast cancer disparities are likely
multifactorial and driven by related combinations of social determinants of health, the paucity of data in Black
women has resulted in a limited understanding of the contribution of breast density to cancer disparities. While
race, a social construct, is an unlikely direct predictor of mammographic density, it can serve as a marker of
differential lived experiences due to various cultural practice, environmental exposures, and experiences of
structural racism. Childhood, puberty, and pregnancy represent times of increased breast development and
susceptibility to such exposures and host factors. In fact, Black women display differing anthropometric and
reproductive patterns – which are known contributors to mammographic density in white women – across their
life course. We hypothesize that unique distributions of body and sexual maturation characteristics during
childhood and puberty, and varying reproductive outcomes during adulthood may, in part, explain the
increased incidence of high mammographic density in Black women. Using the Black Women’s Health Study,
the largest cohort of Black women in the United States (59,000 women), we have developed a large
mammogram repository consisting of over 10,000 participants. Leveraging this analytic tool, in Aim 1, we will
determine the associations of anthropometric, body habitus, and sexual development characteristics across
the life course with percent and absolute mammographic density. Aim 2 will explore the association between
specific pregnancy-related characteristics and percent and absolute mammographic density. This will be the
first study to assess factors from birth to adulthood as predictors of mammographic density in Black women.
Successful completion of these aims will offer insight into the etiology of increased mammographic density in
Black women and contribute to a better understanding of breast cancer incidence and survival disparities in
this vulnerable population. This proposal also integrates advanced epidemiologic techniques and fundamental
biostatistical skills with clinical training to prepare the PI for a career as an independent physician scientist with
expertise in cancer health disparities research."

Increasingly, genomics is being integrated into population-level cancer prevention and control approaches
through precision public health. Given that the field is still emerging, there are limited opportunities for
investigators to come together to form collaborations and to build capacity for research. Thus, our goal for this
R13 renewal application is to convene an annual transdisciplinary conference for investigators who work in this
field to support capacity building in transdisciplinary precision public health research, with a focus in cancer over
the next three years. Our target audience emphasizes engaging early career investigators in cancer precision
public health who are in a pivotal moment in their career for establishing professional networks and identifying
research priorities. Our specific aims for the conference are to (1) increase content knowledge and methods
expertise in cancer precision public health through seminars and question and answer sessions; (2) advance
research priorities for cancer precision public health; and (3) maintain an ongoing professional network of
precision public health researchers in cancer to facilitate future collaborations in precision public health research,
training, and practice. Through this international conference, investigators from around the world will convene
annually to gain new content expertise, to advance key research priorities for the field, and to establish an
ongoing collaborative network to advance precision public health research. This builds on the work of our
inaugural conference which established key research priorities, an ongoing working group to advance these
priorities, and a network of precision public health researchers and practitioners who meet quarterly for webinars
on advanced topics in precision public health in cancer. Moreover, the conference themes will reflect the research
priorities identified in the 2021 conference: implementation science (2023 at University of North Carolina Chapel
Hill), health equity (2024 Medical University of South Carolina) and capacity building (2025 University of
Technology Sydney). Our long-term goal is to maintain a platform for early career investigators interested in
precision public health to come together to support the development of the precision public health research
agenda."

The broad objective of this research proposal is to advance our understanding of thyroid physiology through the
study of genetic defects at key regulatory processes. In addition to identification of new syndromes and gene
defects, research centers on regulation of gene expression and gene therapy. The program owes its success to
the worldwide referral of patient material, to the clinical and technical skills of the PI’s laboratory, and to
collaborative arrangements with accomplished investigators from the US and abroad that provide
complementary knowledge and technical expertise. The proposal by multiple PIs for continuing funding
encompasses three aims. (1) Determine the mechanism by which several newly identified genetic defects
produce the observed thyroid phenotypes. These include the selenoenzyme deiodinases D1 and D3; PKHD1L1
mutations by studying the Pkdh1l1KO mice; and LRP2 mutations by in vitro structural and functional
characterization. (2) Determine the mechanism of resistance to TSH (RTSH) caused by mutations in a primate-
specific short tandem repeat (STR) on chromosome-15. Human thyroid organoids recently developed in
collaboration will be used to generate STR mutant thyroid organoids using CRISPR/Cas9 or PiggyBac
transposon as a genome editing tool, in order to study the physiological function of this primate specific STR and
its role in the dominantly inherited phenotype of RTSH. TSH sensitivity of normal and mutant organoids will be
determined in vitro or in vivo after transplantation into hypothyroid mice. (3) Determine the effectiveness of
combined gene and thyroid hormone (TH) analogue treatments in monocarboxylate 8 (MCT8) deficiency. The X
chromosome linked MCT8 deficiency produces in boys a disease known as Allan-Herndon-Dudley-Syndrome
(AHDS) with severe neuropsychomotor defects, caused by deficiency of TH transport in brain, and systemic
thyrotoxicosis caused by excess of circulating T3. Double knockout (dKO) mice, lacking Mct8 and the TH
transporter Oatp1c1, recapitulate the findings of AHDS. We recently showed that gene therapy in peripubertal
dKO mice with adeno associated virus 9 (AAV9) containing the human MCT8 cDNA improved the locomotor and
cognitive function by near normalization of brain T3 content but failed to correct the serum thyroid tests. We
propose to add the TH analogues diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) or triiodothyroacetic acid (TRIAC) that are
known to correct the thyrotoxicosis of AHDS in peripheral tissues but not the neuropsychomotor manifestations,
to achieve rescue of this incapacitating disease. The proposed research will result in the discovery of new genes
and mechanisms causing congenital and inherited thyroid diseases. In addition to knowledge gained regarding
thyroid physiology and pathophysiology, these studies will provide the means for rapid and specific diagnosis
and for rationale of innovative treatments."

Hepatocellular death plays an essential role in the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The
activity of the energy sensor AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is repressed in NASH and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD). Recent studies from our laboratory demonstrate that AMPK normally phosphorylates the
pro-apoptotic caspase-6 to inhibit its activation, keeping hepatocyte apoptosis in check. Steatosis-induced
suppression of AMPK activity relieves this inhibition, rendering caspase-6 activated in both human and murine
NASH. Activation of AMPK or inhibition of caspase-6, even after the onset of NASH, improves liver damage
and fibrosis. Because caspase-6 is an attractive therapeutic target, we will develop high affinity and high
specificity chemical inhibitors of caspase 6 for the treatment of NASH. We will pursue two series that are
already well advanced, one that binds covalently to the enzyme with high affinity and specificity, and a second
noncovalent series that stabilizes the inactive, zymogen state of caspase-6 and inhibits its activation. Selective
inhibition of caspase-6 over other caspases has been difficult to achieve before now, but should be safe given
the mild phenotype of caspase-6 knockout animals and patients with inactivating mutations. Using structure-
based design, we will develop a clinical candidate based on affinity, specificity, ADME properties,
bioavailability and in vivo activity in mouse models of NASH. We will also develop a biomarker for capsase-6
inhibition in vivo that will help guide future clinical trials. These efforts may lead to development of the first
specific drug that directly attacks the pathogenic process underlying the development of human NASH."

This project utilizes translational approaches to use novel assays to understand the emergence of resistance to
drugs to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). Drug-resistant TB
incidence has increased 80% worldwide over the past 15 years with high mortality, prolonged treatment course,
and poor outcomes. Global multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cure rates average 65% and as many as 11% of
MDR-TB patients develop amplification of drug-resistance on treatment. While emergent drug-resistance is a
major challenge it is often detected too late. This application will study pairs of Mtb strains from patients that had
drug-susceptible TB at baseline then developed drug-resistant TB. There is extensive clinical and adherence
data for these patients. Functional assays for drug-resistance mechanisms will be done to better understand
development of drug-resistance under treatment."

 Homologous recombination (HR) is an important DNA repair mechanism for DNA damage
caused by PARPi and platinum. The HR pathway is closely associated with ovarian cancer
development and chemoresistance. Recent clinical studies showed that PARP inhibitors and
platinum are effective in treating ovarian cancers with mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2, and other
genes encoding proteins involved in HR. Conversely, factors involved in HR promote the repair
of DNA lesions caused by PARP inhibitors and platinum, and this enhanced HR capability
contributes to chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, targeting HR pathway may be a powerful
strategy to overcome resistance to DNA damage-based therapy.
 Here we propose to study a new ATM-SYK-CtIP pathway that regulates HR. We found
the tyrosine kinase SYK plays an important role in HR. SYK’s function in immune regulation is
well established, however, its function in DNA repair has not been shown. We found that SYK
phosphorylates CtIP and regulates CtIP function in HR. SYK itself is also phosphorylated in an
ATM dependent manner and get recruited to the sites of DNA damage. Interestingly, SYK is
overexpressed in recurrent ovarian cancers; high expression of SYK is related to poor outcome
of OCs. Furthermore, inhibition of SYK in OC cell lines renders OC cells sensitize to PARPi or
cisplatin. Taken together, we hypothesize that the ATM-SYK-CtIP pathway is a new
regulatory mechanism for HR. Inhibiting of SYK sensitizes OC cells to cisplatin or PARPi,
suggesting SYK as the novel potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for ovarian cancer
therapy. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Investigate the
regulation of HR by SYK; 2. Investigate the regulation of SYK by the DNA damage signaling; 3.
Determine the inhibition of SYK in chemo-response in OCs using organoid and mouse models.
Our studies will reveal the novel function of SYK in DNA repair and response to chemotherapy.
In addition, it will reveal the new therapeutic targets and biomarkers in OC therapy."

Alcohol use commonly starts in early adolescence with about 50–70% of 15 year-olds already reporting alcohol
use (World Health Organization, 2018). Human and pre-clinical studies have shown that alcohol increases
vulnerability to both bacterial and viral infections (Szabo, 2015), though adolescent sensitivity to the untoward
effects of alcohol on immune function remain unclear. Importantly, neuroimmune function is severely altered by
binge-like alcohol exposure in rodent models yet the role of CNS-mediated host defense processes has not been
determined. The emergence of a global pandemic driven by widespread novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its
associated disease state, COVID-19, has revealed unique vulnerabilities for certain demographics. Although the
greatest vulnerability to adverse outcomes of COVID-19 is age, increasing data demonstrate that male patients
with COVID-19 exhibit enhanced disease severity, higher complication rates, and higher mortality However,
there remains great mystery regarding differences in viral infection severity, and the response to vaccine, across
individuals. We propose that a history of alcohol misuse during adolescence may set the stage for adverse
reactions to viral infection and vaccinations. Our prior work has shown that Adolescent Intermittent Ethanol (AIE)
exposure produced long-lasting, sex-specific changes in immune function. AIE exposure substantially impaired
cytokine expression in circulating lymphocytes when challenged in vivo with the bacterial antigen
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an effect that was robust in males, and completely absent in females. Similar signs of
suppressed cytokine induction were subsequently observed in the hippocampus in response to mild tissue injury,
with other studies reporting impaired fever responses when adolescent alcohol-exposed rats were challenged a
week later with LPS, a TLR4-dependent inflammogen. Although these findings suggest that AIE may produce a
global impairment in inflammatory processes, recent work from our lab suggests that the influence of alcohol
may be pathogen-specific. Specifically, AIE exacerbated the febrile response to polyinosine-polycytidylic acid
(Poly I:C), a synthetic double-stranded (ds)RNA that is used to model viral infections, suggesting that TLR3-
dependent inflammatory processes may be pathologically sensitized by adolescent ethanol exposure. Additional
data suggests that acute ethanol may interfere with the efficacy of anti-pyretic drugs, raising concerns regarding
adolescent binge drinking and altered responding to pharmacotherapeutic treatments for infection later in life.
Therefore, this proposal will test the hypothesis that Adolescent Intermittent Ethanol may represent a latent and
previously unconsidered demographic variable that predicts sex-specific adverse COVID-19 outcomes later in
life. Given the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of strain variants, the more general viral
model of Poly I:C affords the opportunity to establish general features of host defense that are applicable to both
the current global pandemic, as well as viral outbreaks of the future."

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and is a heterogeneous group of ocular
diseases characterized by optic nerve damage and impaired vision. The majority of glaucoma patients are elderly
due to the age-related, optic nerve disease, whereas there are early-onset forms of glaucoma: primary congenital
glaucoma and developmental glaucoma. The resistance to drainage of aqueous humor from the anterior
segment of the eye into the systemic circulation leads to the elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), and elevated
IOP is the primary and only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma. Despite the current treatment options aimed at
lowering IOP, there are urgent needs to develop new, more effective therapeutic approaches. Aqueous humor
drainage as the conventional outflow pathway is mediated through the trabecular meshwork (TM), which is
derived from the neural crest (NC) lineage, into a specialized, lymphatic-like vessel known as Schlemm's canal
(SC). Recent evidence indicates that SC has specialized and unique vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and that
the signaling pathways such as Angiopoietin/Tie2 are essential for the formation and maintenance of SC
vasculature. The long-term goal of our group is to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that regulate SC
maintenance/function and to understand how disruption of these mechanisms leads to impaired outflow causing
increased IOP in pathological settings. To image the full-circle SC and evaluate TM stiffness in mice, our group
has recently developed a circular-scanning visible-light OCT (vis-OCT) system. FOXC2 is a member of the FOX
(Forkhead box) transcription factor family and has critical roles in vascular development and disease. Inactivating
mutations in human FOXC2 are dominantly associated with lymphedema, which is characterized by obstructed
lymph drainage in the limbs, and recent evidence has shown that FOXC2 variants possess a role as putative
modifiers for the development of primary congenital glaucoma. However, its role in TM and SC cells has yet to
be fully investigated. The results from our preliminary experiments via vis-OCT imaging, immunohistochemistry,
and single-cell RNA sequencing indicate that the NC-Foxc2-/- mutation is associated with defective TM formation,
abnormal SC morphology, or the absence of the SC, a reduction in expression of PROX1, VEGFR3, and TEK
in SC ECs, and elevated IOP, and that the EC-Foxc2-/- mutation results in impaired SC formation. Our central
hypothesis is that novel diagnostic vis-OCT imaging techniques elucidate the significance of Foxc2 function in
both NC-derived TM cells and SC ECs in SC formation/maintenance and TM stiffness. To test this hypothesis,
we have two Specific Aims. First, we will develop a new balanced-detection vis-OCT to determine the anatomical
influence of the Foxc2 regulatory network in SC formation/maintenance. Second, we will develop new
methodologies to evaluate TM stiffness based on vis-OCT phase imaging after high-speed temporal speckle
reduction to define the functional influence of the Foxc2 regulatory network in TM stiffness and ECM
compositions."

The goal of this project is to develop an osteochondral construct that mimics native osteochondral tissue. Based
on pilot data, it is expected that microRNA modulation can be used to guide differentiation of cartilage progenitor
cells into native-like osteochondral tissue. The studies described herein will define the biological pathways
impacted by overexpressing specific microRNAs in CPC chondrogenesis. They will also develop a culture
system that simultaneously exposes tissue constructs to two separate media. Articular cartilage defect
treatments are restricted to solutions that are temporary, require secondary defect creation (autograft), or have
limited supply (allograft). Even with treatment, these defects can lead to osteoarthritis – a leading cause of
disability in the US and world. Cartilage progenitor cells (CPCs) can be isolated from most articular cartilage
tissues including osteoarthritic joint tissues. CPCs are multi-potent cells that can differentiate into articular-like
or hypertrophic cartilage, the latter of which serves as a template for bone formation. MicroRNAs (miRs) are 21-
25 nucleotide epigenetic regulators that have been used to guide osteogenic CPC differentiation. In Specific Aim
1, a miR-mediated differentiation system capable of producing osteochondral tissue from CPCs will be
developed. Prior studies suggest that lentivirus-mediated overexpression of miR-138 can be used to maintain
CPCs in an articular-like cartilage state while upregulating miR-181a/b promotes CPC differentiation into
hypertrophic cartilage and bone. CPCs have been seeded onto demineralized human bone scaffolds to create
3D bone tissue. These scaffolds have also been used to develop 3D cartilage tissue using bone marrow-derived
stromal cells. A bi-culture system that facilitates site-specific growth of CPC-based cartilage and bone on a
demineralized human bone scaffold will be tested. The resulting construct will be characterized using histology
(von Kossa, Safranin-O), µCT (bone mineralization), and mechanical testing (cartilage aggregate modulus,
hydraulic permeability, shear strength). The biological role of each miR will be assessed in CPC chondrogenic
pellet cultures using RNA-Seq and associated bioinformatic analyses (GO, KEGG, GSEA). In Specific Aim 2,
osteochondral constructs will be evaluated in vivo and ex vivo. Constructs will be histologically and mechanically
evaluated after being implanted into the dorsal flanks of immunodeficient mice for 8 weeks for in vivo testing.
Meanwhile, the bi-culture system from Specific Aim 1 will be used to preserve human osteochondral tissue ex
vivo. Defects will be created in these tissue explants and the osteochondral constructs will be implanted in the
defects. Histology and mechanical testing will be used to evaluate repair of the defect. This project focuses on
using molecular biology techniques to produce biological tissue engineering constructs. The trainee will gain
experience in molecular and cellular biology, tissue engineering, biomechanical testing, bioinformatics, and
animal handling. The Washington University in St. Louis Musculoskeletal Research Center provides expertise,
equipment, and collaborations necessary to develop and characterize these osteochondral tissue constructs."
10823219,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) are a major public health burden and disproportionately
affect Black individuals. Although socioeconomic and cardiovascular risk factors partially account for this,
experiences of structural (e.g. school segregation) and interpersonal racism (e.g. discrimination) could be
important drivers of cognitive inequities. The racialized experience of school segregation can have pervasive
effects on sustained discriminatory events and poor health outcomes because of stress-response activation, in
addition to decreased socioeconomic opportunities, which may contribute to increased ADRDs risk. Limited
studies on the impact of school segregation on late-life cognitive outcomes have produced mixed findings and
did not consider incident dementia risk. Additionally, prior studies have not considered mid or late-life
mediators of the association between school segregation or quantified the timing of school segregation. Thus,
the rationale for the proposed research is to delineate the association of school segregation and resulting
experiences of interpersonal discrimination on ADRDs risk to explain why Black individuals have a higher
ADRDs burden than other racial and ethnic groups and to identify potential strategies to prevent ADRDs and
reduce ADRDs disparities (e.g. organization and occupational policies to reduce racism). The analysis will
leverage the Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans and Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life
Experiences, NIA-funded longitudinal cohorts of older adult populations in the United States. The overall
objective of this application is to examine the effect of school segregation on ADRDs inequities among older
Black and White adults (ages 50-89). This project will also address how experiences of discrimination across
the lifecourse impact cognitive trajectories and ADRDs risk. Specifically, this study will evaluate the association
between attendance at a racially segregated school on cognitive decline and ADRDs risk among Black
individuals (Aim 1) and evaluate the role of everyday and major life discrimination as mediators of this
association (Aim 2). Finally, the proposed study will estimate the extent to which racial differences in cognitive
decline and ADRDs risk are contributed by differential exposure to school segregation, everyday
discrimination, and major life discrimination among Black and White individuals (Aim 3). Examining the roles of
sociocontextual factors on ADRDs risk in a large, diverse cohort of Black and White individuals will provide
valuable insight into the sustained effects of structural and interpersonal racism on ADRDs risk and will inform
population interventions to reduce ADRDs inequities including the targeting of intermediate or proximal
mechanisms (e.g. improving neighborhood and educational quality, enhancing access to additional income and
employment opportunities). The proposed training, guided by an exemplary mentorship team, will enhance the
applicant’s methodological skills, research competency, and content expertise needed for her career as a
future independent researcher in ADRDs focused on strategies to reduce racial inequities."

 Streptavidin (SA) and biotin have the strongest known binding interaction in nature, with a KD in the
femtomolar range (4.8x10-14 M). This extraordinary binding affinity has led to its ubiquitous use in biomedical
research and diagnostics. Though SA/biotin enjoys success in many applications, abundant endogenous biotin
attenuates assay sensitivity. Moreover, SA is a highly immunogenic foreign protein, which limits its use in
therapeutic applications such as pretargeted immunotherapy (PTI).
 Mirror-image SA and biotin (D-SA/L-biotin) offer an elegant solution to these problems. For example, D-
Proteins are inert to L-proteases and therefore cannot be digested for MHC presentation to the immune system.
This property means that D-SA will have greatly decreased immunogenicity and increased half-life compared to
L-SA. Additionally, symmetry dictates that the mirror-image pair (D-SA/L-biotin) will have the exact same
exceptional affinity as the natural pair (L-SA/D-biotin). Importantly, we have discovered that D-biotin has minimal
binding to D-SA. Therefore, we propose that D-SA/L-biotin can be used as a biotin orthogonal streptavidin system
(BOSS). We hypothesize that the orthogonality of BOSS, along with D-SA’s low immunogenicity, will
overcome the limitations of natural SA/biotin.
 We will chemically synthesize D-SA using solid-phase peptide synthesis with D-amino acids and native
chemical ligation. We will then replicate a previously reported SA PTI method using BOSS. We will attach this
D-SA to the C-terminus of the antibody fragment (scFv) used in the previous study (scFv-D-SA) and will
recombinantly express its L-counterpart (scFv-L-SA). This scFv binds to GD2, a cell-surface glycosphingolipid
that is upregulated in neuroblastoma (NB). We will first measure the efficacy of scFv-D-SA in NB cells using
fluorescence microscopy. We will attach a red fluorophore to D-biotin and magenta fluorophore to L-biotin to
determine the relative binding of scFv-D-SA and scFv-L-SA to the NB cells and a panel of control cells. We will
then test our BOSS PTI method in mice xenografted with NB cells using fluorescence-based full-body imaging
to look for enhanced fluorescence localized around the tumor. We expect that BOSS will dramatically improve
current pretargeting efforts. Moreover, given the ubiquity of biotin/SA-based systems throughout biomedical
science, we also expect BOSS to be widely applicable and relevant to proximity labeling, diagnostic testing, and
any method that suffers from SA immunogenicity and biotin interference."

Substance use disorder is a chronic relapsing disease that is characterized by repeated drug use despite
negative consequences. Despite extensive efforts into examining the underlying molecular mechanisms of
methamphetamine use disorder, there are currently no FDA approved therapeutics to treat this debilitating
disease. Repeated methamphetamine (METH) use induces long-term gene expression changes in brain regions
associated with reward processing and drug-seeking behavior, and recent evidence suggests that METH-
induced neuroinflammation may also be involved in behavioral and molecular responses to the drug. Microglia,
the resident immune cells in the brain, are principal drivers of neuroinflammatory responses, yet the role of these
cells in the regulation of METH-related behaviors is poorly understood. In this proposal, I will examine microglial
gene expression dynamics during METH-taking and seeking using a mouse model of intravenous
methamphetamine self-administration (METH IVSA) and multi-omic molecular analyses. Preliminary data in Aim
1 (F99) demonstrate that microglia respond to METH-exposure by inducing neuroinflammatory gene expression
and, accordingly, changing their cellular morphology. Additionally, since our preliminary results suggest that
depletion of microglia attenuates drug-seeking after prolonged abstinence, I propose to further investigate the
transcriptional and epigenetic changes in microglia in response to METH-taking and during METH craving and
seeking. To this end, microglia will be isolated from METH IVSA for RNA sequencing analysis and chromatin
profiling using CUT&Tag (F99). For this, I will be trained to isolate microglia for RNA and chromatin extraction,
as well as the downstream bioinformatic pipelines required for data analysis. For Aim 2 (K00), I will identify a
postdoctoral mentor with whom to study the effect of early life stress on microglia that contribute to later life
susceptibility to psychiatric and substance use disorders. These studies will sharpen our understanding of the
microglial transcriptome and epigenome during METH reinforcement and how these cells influence METH-taking
and seeking behavior, while also fostering my development into a postdoctoral scholar, and ultimately for a
successful career as an independent investigator in an academic tenure-track position."
10991656,"Project Summary/Abstract
Interleukin-1B (IL-1B) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine with conflicting roles in mouse and human cancers. The
cytokine enhances tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis, and chronic inflammation mediated by IL-1B can
induce carcinogenesis. At the same time, IL-1 signaling bolsters the adaptive immune system, polarizing CD4+
T cells toward T helper type 1 and 17 lineages and enhancing the effector function of CD8+ T cells to improve
tumor cell killing. A large clinical trial found that anti-IL-1B treatment significantly reduced tumor incidence in
humans, highlighting the effect of IL-1 signaling on human health. IL-1 signaling is well-regulated by both a
receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and a non-signaling decoy receptor (IL-1R2). IL-1RA acts at the organism level to
suppress systemic inflammation, while IL-1R2 is thought to attenuate local inflammation in tissues.
Using RNA sequencing, we have identified a population of highly activated IL-1R2+ regulatory T cells (Tregs)
in healthy skin and tumor samples from mice and humans. Tregs are critical suppressors of inflammation in
tissues, but tumor infiltrating Tregs can dampen adaptive immunity to promote cancer growth. However, the
function of IL-1R2 in cancer and Treg biology is not well understood. In our hands, deleting IL-1R2 on Tregs
led to increased tumor growth in mice, suggesting that IL-1 signaling enhances Treg activation. This proposal
will test whether Treg expression of IL-1R2 attenuates their activation in a cell intrinsic fashion by
neutralizing local IL-1B. First, we will define the factors that induce IL-1R2 expression on Tregs in mice and
humans (Aim 1). We will then investigate the functional role of IL-1R2 on tumor infiltrating Tregs (Aim 2).
Lastly, we will determine whether IL-1R2 can be used as a target to selectively deplete Tregs in tumors and
bolster anti-tumor immunity (Aim 3). The proposal will not only broaden our understanding of IL-1 signaling in
Tregs but may also establish a new approach for cancer immunotherapy.
This research strategy will be conducted alongside a comprehensive training plan to develop the applicant’s
career as an academic physician-scientist. Training will include structured and rigorous mentorship in technical
skills and experimental design from a highly qualified physician-scientist sponsor, carried out through regular
one-on-one and lab meetings, courses, seminars, journal clubs, and immunology department events. The
research and training will take place at the University of California, San Francisco, which provides an excellent
research environment for immunology alongside an outstanding graduate education in biomedical sciences."
10610797,"Background: An estimated 10-50% of patients with a history of COVID-19 infection (C+) experience PASC.
PASC presents as a multisystem syndrome, with symptoms ranging in severity and regularity that can last
weeks to months after acute infection. These symptoms can lead to mild to severe functional limitations that
adversely impact quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that inequities in PASC are experienced
especially by historically underserved populations (as with acute COVID-19). The lack of a standard case
definition risks burdening patients by delaying access to treatment and management. Yet currently there are no
evidence-based practices (EBP) for managing and treating PASC. Efforts to define PASC are urgently needed
to address knowledge gaps, advance discovery of EBPs, and improve care.
Significance: Our long-term goal is to ensure that every Veteran with PASC receives appropriate, timely, and
effective EBP to reduce PASC-related morbidity and maintain Veterans’ quality of life. Since the cumulative
cases of COVID-19 exceed 520,000 in VA, and 146 million in the US, and many are still at risk, our findings will
have broad public health impact within and beyond VA.
Innovation and Impact: VA has a unique opportunity to play a central role in defining PASC by leveraging its
multiple high-quality data sources, such as the COVID-19 Shared Data Resource. PASC definitions can be
derived from: 1) International Classification of Disease diagnosis codes, 2) electronic health record (EHR) chart
review, and 3) Veteran-reported symptom surveys. We propose to integrate these VA data sources and
mechanisms to identify a unified phenotypic description of PASC. Interviews with Veterans and other
stakeholders will further enrich our understanding of PASC. Collectively, these data will address research gaps
in understanding current PASC treatment models and assess variability and inequities in care.
Specific Aims: 1. Define and characterize PASC in the VA C+ population using EHR and survey data.
2. Characterize clinical management strategies and care delivery models for PASC, including pharmacological
and non-pharmacological treatments (e.g., Whole Health, Pain, Rehabilitation). 3. Assess health inequities in
PASC phenotypes, symptom trajectories, and management.
Methodology: In Aim 1 we will identify distinct symptom clusters among C+ Veterans in VA using
unsupervised clustering and examine the consequences of applying different criteria for PASC on estimation of
PASC incidence and on the relationship between PASC and symptom clusters. In Aim 2 we will characterize
clinical management leveraging EHR data and Veterans’ self-care via survey data. We will also conduct key
informant interviews in facilities with high and low C+ prevalence to determine how healthcare teams identify
PASC and select management and care delivery approaches. In Aim 3 we will examine relationships between
Aims 1-2 metrics and social determinants of health. We will also evaluate Veterans’ health and care
experiences with PASC using video interview methodologies of the Health Experiences Research Network.
Next Steps/Implementation: By completing these aims, we will provide a comprehensive, actionable
definition of PASC. Using our definition, we will address gaps in understanding the epidemiology, health
services utilized, and inequities related to PASC. This knowledge will advance efforts in developing EBPs for
PASC."
10814872,"SUMMARY
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) self-renew indefinitely in culture while retaining the capacity to produce all cell
types of the body. Mouse ESCs are typically maintained in serum and LIF, which capture a state resembling the
normally methylated, post-implantation epiblast, whereas culture of ESC in the presence of inhibitors of MEK1/2
and GSK3, termed “2i”, captures a hypomethylated, naïve state that resembles the pre-implantation epiblast. As
Wnt activation (via GSK3 inhibitor) and MAPK suppression (via MEK1/2 inhibitor) recapitulates the signaling
environment of early embryos, 2i-induced hypomethylation offers a tractable and powerful ex vivo system to
study the reprogramming of genomic methylation patterns within the pre-implantation embryo. Notably,
methylation patterns are not only influenced by external signals but also by sex chromosomes, with female ESCs
being hypomethylated compared to male ESCs. The process of female-specific hypomethylation and its
connection to the naïve state remain incompletely understood. We recently discovered that suppression of the
MAPK pathway through pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2 or upregulation of the X-linked MAPK phosphatase
DUSP9 underlies 2i-induced and female-specific hypomethylation, respectively. Unexpectedly, we found that
suppression of the MAPK pathway also compromises genomic stability and the developmental potential of ESCs.
Here, we outline 3 complementary aims to dissect the mechanisms by which the MAPK pathway influences DNA
methylation in pluripotent cells through either sex chromosomes or external signals. In SPECIFIC AIM 1, we will
narrow down the upstream and downstream components of the MAPK pathway responsible for hypomethylation
and test candidate targets identified by proteomics approaches. We will further explore the molecular
consequences of loss of genomic hypomethylation within the naïve epiblast. In SPECIFIC AIM 2, we will test
candidate targets of DUSP9 in female ESCs and integrate results with Aim 1 to define similarities and differences
between sex-dependent and environment (2i)-induced hypomethylation. We will further characterize the self-
renewal defect we uncovered in ESCs lacking both Dusp9 alleles and assess its dependence on DNA
methylation. Lastly, we will determine whether sex-specific methylation differences in ESCs originate from pre-
or post-implantation embryos. In SPECIFIC AIM 3, we will investigate whether the mechanistic connection we
observed between MAPK signaling and DNA methylation is conserved in naïve human ESCs and whether this
information can be exploited to grow more stable human cells. Specifically, we will assess whether the titration
of inhibitors that target MAPK signaling or the use of alternative MEK inhibitors increases DNA methylation and
decreases genomic instability. Collectively, our work will explore molecular links between MAPK signaling
and DNA methylation, genomic stability and developmental potential in pluripotent cells with the goal to
dissect basic mechanisms and define improved conditions for human stem cells."

The primary goal of this Training Program is to develop academic leaders among Neonatologists, Maternal-
Fetal Medicine (MFM) Specialists, and Non-Clinician Scientists who know how to work together collaboratively
and have the capacity, based on personal meritorious accomplishments in research, to identify, understand,
and solve important problems in Perinatal Biology and Medicine. This training program provides basic and
clinical-translational research training, including concepts and techniques in perinatal/developmental physiology,
biochemistry, and cell and molecular biology. To our knowledge, ours is the only T32 Training Program
designed with this focus, structure, and goal. Trainees will be appointed after demonstrating research
commitment and accomplishment during their late 1st or 2nd yr of fellowship/postdoctoral training. During their 1st
year, trainees work with Faculty Mentors on their primary research projects while integrating into the broader
perinatal biology community at CU-AMC through our T32 Curriculum. This gives them the multidisciplinary
training required in Perinatal Biology. Formal training in Responsible Conduct of Research and Rigorous
Research Design and Relevant Data Science and Quantitative Approaches are required. The 2nd year is devoted
to the completion of the research projects, manuscript submission, expansion of the Fellow's research with
interdisciplinary approaches, and further career development training. Seminar programs in research design,
abstract and manuscript preparation, laboratory and career management, and grant writing are provided. This
approach allows us to fulfill our two Specific Aims. Our primary specific aim is to provide the training and
environment that ensures short- and long-term success of T32 Fellows as defined by: 1) publications, 2)
appointment to research-intensive positions, 3) Career Development Awards, 4) Pilot and Project Grants, 5)
research based awards and honors, and 6) Scientific Leadership Positions. Our secondary specific aim is to
further strengthen the research endeavors related to Perinatal Biology and Medicine at CU-AMC as defined by
1) collaborative manuscripts with T32 Fellows, 2) co-mentorship of Trainees, 3) joint grant submissions, and 4)
joint establishment of innovative programs. This aim directly benefits the T32 Fellows as it models the type of
collaborative research we want them to engage in long-term. We also will place a major emphasis on the
recruitment of NIH defined underrepresented minorities to our T32 Program with supplemental
research and career development funds ($12,000 per URM Trainee) provided by the Section of
Neonatology. Our approach equips the trainees with the capacity to move more successfully into academic

achieved high academic positions nationally and internationally and have had major impact on developing and
supporting research training programs. Attaining such ultimate research/academic leadership among our trainees
is a major aim of this program."
10833546,"Fast glutamatergic synaptic transmission is based on a precise and complex molecular organization which
requires the control of the number of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) at the postsynaptic sites
of glutamatergic synapses on dendritic spines. The number of AMPARs varies as a function of pre- and
postsynaptic activation history of the synapse. It is now well described that synapses can change their
number of AMPARs and therefore, their response properties through biochemical mechanisms of synaptic
plasticity. In this way, information is stored in the brain. The overall goal of this project is to use quantitative
models and experiments to answer two fundamental questions about the role of an abundant postsynaptic
protein, synGAP, in regulation of the numbers of AMPARs. Numerous experiments in intact neurons have
revealed that the level of synGAP expressed at synapses is inversely correlated with the amount of
AMPARs available at the synapses, and that synGAP helps to regulate changes in AMPAR numbers
during synaptic plasticity. The enzymatic GAP domain of synGAP acts as a ratchet to adjust the rates of
addition and removal of AMPARs from the surface of the dendrite. SynGAP also contains a sight that binds
tightly to the major scaffold protein PSD-95 via its three protein-binding PDZ domains. Important to the
mental health mission of the NIMH, SynGAP plays a critical role in learning and memory in the Brain and
mutation of SynGAP is implicated in cognitive disabilities. The project is divided into two broad Aims. In Aim
1, we will answer the question: What are the mechanisms by which synGAP controls the amount of AMPA
receptor in the postsynaptic density (PSD) - by control of surface amount and/or by control of availability of
PDZ domain binding sites in the synapse? We will improve our existing computational model of the
competition between synGAP and AMPARs for binding to PSD-95 by incorporating it into our model of
AMPAR trafficking. We will use genetics and sophisticated molecular engineering to experimentally
disentangle the two mechanisms. Effects on the nano-organization of AMPARs will be measured by super-
resolution fluorescence microscopy and electrophysiology. Results of these experiments will be used to
constrain our model of AMPAR trafficking. Aim 2, Through the synergy of experimental and computational
approaches, we will address the questions: How does the formation of the condensate between synGAP
and PSD-95, and the presence of additional PDZ domain-binding proteins (GluN2 receptor subunits,
neuroligin, nNOS, CRIPT, etc.) influence the nano-organization of AMPAR-TARPs in the PSD in the basal
state and during synaptic plasticity?
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
We propose a combination of computational and experimental work that will help clarify the role of synGAP
in regulation of AMPARs in CNS synapses, including its role in mental illness. The work will impact a
specific medical condition termed “SynGAP haploinsufficiency” or “MRD5”, in which SynGAP is mutated in
~1% of children with sporadic non-syndromic cognitive disability accompanied by autism and/or epilepsy.
The medical impacts of this work are potentially quite significant as it could help to point toward specific
molecular interventions with therapeutics that could improve the lives of patients with these afflictions."

Treatment advances in psychosis are limited by the use of phenomenology-defined diagnoses based on
symptomatic outcomes, rather than by neurobiological constructs monitored by quantitative characteristics. The
Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) uses biomarkers to define psychosis
subgroups with the goal of testing the advantages of B-SNIP biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions,
consistent with principles in the NIMH Strategic Plan (NSP). With >3000 phenotyped psychosis probands,
relatives and healthy controls (HC), B-SNIP has a multilevel biomarker library for psychosis and used that library
to re-conceptualize psychosis subgroups as biomarker-defined Biotypes (B1, B2, B3), where B1 and B2 are the
low cognition/high symptom groups and B3 shows lower symptoms and relatively normal cognition. We
replicated Biotypes in a new sample, “forging a future where measures of an individual’s … neural and
physiological state will form the basis of an increasingly specific and informative diagnosis” (NSP). In this grant
we propose that B1, with its low cognition and low cortical activity, will respond uniquely to clozapine, a drug
which will generate active cortical attractor networks in B1 to support symptomatic improvement.
Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic drug (APD) with unique clinical efficacy. It is the least used APD
because its side effects are serious (neutropenia, myocarditis, seizures) and its administration complex. A
predictive biomarker would allow targeting of cases most likely to respond and improve prognosis in psychosis.
B-SNIP has shown that clozapine is associated with increases in EEG measures of alpha/theta power, and we
identify this increase in time periods without stimulus processing requirements as intrinsic EEG activity (IEA),
across all Biotypes. Because B1 cases express low IEA, clozapine’s action to increase EEG power will be
normalizing for this psychosis subgroup, with increased cortical attractor states. Because B2 express
accentuated IEA, clozapine is associated with more deviant IEA in B2. We propose to test B1 psychosis cases
with clozapine vs. risperidone (n=40/group clinical trial completers), over a 6 week cross-titration (to therapeutic
plasma levels) and a 9 week stable dose extension, predicting that the B1/clozapine group will respond
significantly better, as measured with total PANSS, than the B1/risperidone group and also better than either B2
group. It is our hypothesis that the cortical attractor networks will be normalized and their function increased by
the increase in intrinsic EEG activity."

ABSTRACT
The Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training (CCTST) was established at the University of
Cincinnati (UC) in 2005 and awarded an institutional Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) in 2009.
Since that time, basic science research, genomics, technology, and drug development have made remarkable
progress, warranting new solutions for translating research to practice. Concurrent with these discoveries, the
CCTST has created innovative solutions for our program functions, including biomedical informatics,
biostatistics and study design, regulatory and ethics, community engagement and team science, recruitment
and support for clinical trials, patient care interactions, pilot grants, and translational workforce development.
With the competitive renewal application and the current revision and creation of CCTST 3.0, we will continue
to utilize the guiding principles of learning health systems to develop stronger bidirectional relationships with
our community and expeditiously bring discoveries to application. Indeed, we intend to capture this tremendous
opportunity to better align the clinical/operational mission of the health system with the research mission of the
University and its affiliates. The overarching goal of the CCTST is to maximize the impact of clinical and
translational research to improve individual and population health locally and nationally, through 1) engaging
stakeholders to collaboratively translate research into improved health care practice and community wellness
across the lifespan; 2) developing a diverse, multidisciplinary workforce to conduct innovative, team-based,
community-engaged translational research and to disseminate and implement findings that will improve health
outcomes and reduce disparities; and 3) optimizing the use of biomedical data across the translational
research continuum using innovative data science methods to advance discovery, dissemination, and
implementation. For each of the programs and optional functions, these aims serve as the basis for planned
innovative activities and to facilitate cross-core integration. We specifically target learning health systems as an
optional module for this application because of the expertise available at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
Center that can be leveraged across the CCTST and its health care affiliates. In fulfilling these aims, CCTST
3.0 will catalyze the translation of discoveries into improved health outcomes locally and nationally.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the principal cause of blindness among working-age adults in the United States. In
individuals with diabetes mellitus, the duration and the severity of hyperglycemia correlate with the risk of
developing retinopathy, and have long been considered the main factors leading to DR onset. However the
mechanism by which hyperglycemia leads to DR pathology is not known. Photoreceptors are both the most
abundant and the most metabolically active cells in the retina, and they have been shown to contribute to the
pathogenesis of DR, but the photoreceptor response to hyperglycemia remains poorly understood. Our
preliminary data suggests that the c2 isoform of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) is significantly
induced in photoreceptors exposed to hyperglycemia in vivo, and is activated and translocates to the nucleus
of photoreceptors treated with high glucose in vitro. NFATc2 target genes include cytokines that have been
shown to regulate inflammation and related processes driving the progression of DR. However the functional
implications of NFATc2 induction in photoreceptors exposed to high glucose are not known. The hypothesis of
this project is that specific inhibition of NFATc2 in photoreceptors under hyperglycemic conditions can reduce
the induction of pro-inflammatory proteins and decrease the downstream effects of photoreceptors on other
retinal cell types, including Müller glia and retinal microvascular endothelial cells. Under the mentorship of Dr.
John Penn, this hypothesis will be tested using a stepwise approach, complementing primary cell culture-
based assays (Aim 1) with in vivo mouse models of DR-relevant pathologic processes (Aim 2). Confirming the
ability of NFAT inhibitors and NFATc2 loss of function in photoreceptors to reduce the progression of DR will
affirm the potential of NFATc2 as a treatment target for this condition. The principal investigator is an M.D.
Ph.D. physician-scientist with scientific training in neuroscience and clinical training as a vitreoretinal surgeon.
The K08 award will leverage her prior training under the mentorship of a world-class team with extensive
experience in retinal vascular disease, retinal cell biology, and animal models of diabetes, and that includes, in
addition to Dr. John Penn, Dr. Sabine Fuhrmann an expert in the neural retina and the retinal pigment
epithelium, and Dr. Maureen Gannon, an expert in systemic diabetes. The work will take place within the
outstanding scientific and collaborative environment of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which have an excellent track record of producing successful clinician-
scientists. Dr. De la Huerta will develop the necessary skills to become an independent investigator in the field
of diabetic retinopathy, while generating pilot data to successfully compete for independent NIH funding, to
advance the understanding of DR pathophysiology and to accelerate the development of new DR therapies."
10828390,"Single-Molecule High-Confidence Detection of miRNA Cancer Biomarkers
PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a technology platform for high confidence and robust single
molecule analysis of miRNA biomarkers in cancer samples through simultaneous detection of miRNAs, in
under an hour. Although miRNAs are short, they regulate essentially all cellular pathways relevant to human
health and disease, including cancer. After being exported from cells, the cell-free circulating miRNAs are
found to be relatively more stable than other nucleic acids, making them of high interest as clinical cancer
biomarkers. Current methods for miRNA analysis, including PCR assays, face challenges due to inherent
inconsistencies in day-to-day and lab-to-lab results in addition to false negatives and positives. We have
recently developed a unique fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based single molecule dynamic
sensor to enable high confidence and ultrasensitive detection of an unlabeled DNA as well as miRNA targets
and demonstrated that the sensing platform works in serum and fully discriminates targets from point mutant
controls. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that the sensor exhibits a
static FRET level in the absence of a target. However, in the presence of the target, the sensor forms a four-
way junction and hence undergoes a dynamic switching between a low- and a high-FRET state, a feature
that enables high-confidence detection of the target. We demonstrated these features initially using a p53
tumor suppressor gene and later a miRNA associated with the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), both in
buffer and in spiked-in samples using 10% serum. In this proposal, we will focus on the development and
testing of this platform for high-confidence detection through multiplexed analysis of miRNAs in non-clinical
as well as minimally processed cancer samples. In Aim 1, we will design and characterize a sensing platform
for the detection of DNA sequences in one sample. In Aim 2, we will characterize and validate the detection
platform for simultaneous detection of miRNAs specific to TNBC. We will also establish a speedy detection
of TNBC miRNAs using a microfluidic device with parallel channels. In Aim 3, we will identify the abundant
miRNAs in tumor tissues and serum samples of TNBC-carrying patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice via
miRNA sequencing and apply our single-molecule multiplexed platform to detect those TNBC miRNAs in
serum samples from the PDX mice. Our proposed approach offers a number of important innovations
including i) a generic platform for error-free detection of miRNAs, ii) ultimate sensitivity via single-molecule
detection, iii) simultaneous detection of multiple biomarkers in the same sample - allowing high-confidence
detection, and iv) target labeling and amplification are not required. Therefore, this multiplexed platform has
the potential to be a transformative technology in the early diagnosis of cancer. By providing detection
sensitivity and confidence that meets or exceeds state-of-the-art clinical analyzers, the proposed approach
could bring new initiatives in clinical diagnosis, cancer assessment, and individualized cancer treatments."

The advancements of genomic technologies and assemblies of large disparate sets of biological and health
data have outpaced the ability to integrate these different sources of information. Powerful statistical methods
and software are needed to fill this gap in order to provide novel understandings of biological processes, as
well as provide better predictions of human diseases to achieve the vision of personalized medicine. The broad
goals of this project are to advance genetic epidemiology studies of human traits and diseases by expanding
our development of statistical analytic methods and software encompassing four main areas: 1) multivariate
methods to decipher genetic contributions; 2) statistical fine-mapping of genetic variants; 3) causal mediation
methods; 4) polygenic risk scores (PRS) for predicting disease. Although these areas might appear broad and
disparate, there is pressing need to build more integrative methods across these domains. For example,
because molecular pleiotropy is pervasive, multivariate analysis is essential to identify shared genetic factors
acting through common biological mechanisms of multiple traits, and when using PRS to predict disease,
complex traits are often better predicted when multivariate correlated traits are used. And, the methods used
for statistical fine-mapping, including use of annotation, are relevant for creating PRS to predict disease. Our
team, involving statistical geneticists, computational biologists, genetic epidemiologist and clinical
investigators, has decades of experience and will capitalize on the extensive resources and collaborations we
have developed. Our novel methods will be applied to a broad range of diseases, with ultimate aims to better
understand disease etiology and improved disease prediction across different ethnic groups to reduce health
disparities. User-friendly software will be distributed with open access to the scientific community. We will take
advantage of rapidly evolving technologies, biologic and computational insights from multiple fields, and
evolving public health and clinical unmet needs to inform our science."

The overarching goal of our research is to develop new biomarkers of islet autoimmunity and to translate these
discoveries to the prevention of human type 1 diabetes (T1D). During the last funding period, we developed a
multiplexed assay to detect serum autoantibodies to islet and non-islet autoantigens with excellent sensitivity
and predictive value when compared to our traditional radio-binding assays. The proposed studies will broaden
the spectrum of relevant autoantigens to those that are post-translationally modified (PTM) as well as provide
insights into when native versus PTM binding autoantibodies develop in the natural history of T1D. Our recent
findings have strengthened the evidence for autoreactive T cells responding to (pro)insulin, including those
activated by hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) and defective ribosomal insulin products (DRiPs), within the residual
pancreatic islets of T1D organ donors. However, we still lack robust T cell biomarkers that could reflect the
activity of autoreactive T cells, especially at the earliest stages of islet autoimmunity or during immunomodulation
to prevent progression to clinical diabetes. Assays for islet autoantibodies and autoreactive T cells that measure
both natural and modified islet autoantigens, combined with a better understanding of their relationship, will
enhance our knowledge of T1D pathogenesis and improve prediction of progression through the stages of T1D.
In specific aim 1, we will optimize and multiplex autoantibody assays to native and PTM modified islet
autoantigens to determine the temporal development of these antibodies in longitudinal samples from children
prospectively followed from birth to development of islet autoimmunity and clinical diabetes. Specific aim 2
focuses on developing a non-cellular T cell biomarker of islet autoimmunity measured from whole blood DNA
using the T cell receptor sequences obtained from residual islets of T1D organ donors. The successful
completion of this proposal will result in scalable assays for the measurement of islet autoantibodies and
autoreactive T cells, and improved understanding regarding the timing of autoantibody and T cell immune
responses to native and post-translationally modified islet autoantigens during the development of T1D."

 This project will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying utterance planning in the service of spoken
interactions. We hypothesize that planning-related activity within specific cortical sites enables the rapid vocal
exchanges necessary for fluent human conversation. To test this hypothesis, we will identify planning regions
using electrocorticography (ECoG), a technique with sufficient temporal and spatial precision to localize
neural responses in subjects engaged in both controlled interactions and unstructured conversation. In
preliminary data, we found that activity within the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG; containing Broca’s region) is often
tied to utterance planning. We will characterize ECoG responses by isolating both the linguistic processing
and phonological output buffer (i.e., working memory) components of these responses. We will then determine
the importance of planning-related activity by examining behavioral effects that result from complementary
reversible cortical perturbations.
 In Aim 1, we will use ECoG to test our hypothesis that specific cortical sites are involved in speech-selective
motor planning in both controlled interactions (i.e., a question-answer paradigm) as well as natural,
ethologically-relevant conversation.
 In Aim 2, we will dissect utterance planning into its component parts using two different approaches: (1) a
‘command-response’ paradigm with increasing relevance to speech (as opposed to other motor acts) to
determine the degree to which these responses can be characterized as linguistic processing and (2) a
variable delay picture naming task to isolate the phonological output buffering component of the observed
planning activity.
 In Aim 3, we will assess the necessity of planning-related activity for vocal interactions by measuring the
behavioral deficits that occur following transient perturbations of planning regions. Direct cortical stimulation
will be used to disrupt planning activity with high temporal precision. Mild focal brain surface cooling will be
used as a complementary method of modulating the temporal dynamics of planning activity.
 From our studies, we will investigate the cortical network enabling vocal interactions to better understand
the neural mechanisms underlying turn-taking with the broader goal of informing future therapeutic
interventions designed to address the clinical conditions affecting human social language use."
10871798,"Veterans have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than the general population. Valvular diseases
including Calcific Aortic Valve Disease (CAVD) are a particular concern for the aging Veteran Population. At
present, there is no medical therapy to delay or reverse CAVD, and the only treatment is valve replacement for
severe aortic valve stenosis. CAVD involves remodeling of the heart valve tissue as a consequence of
endothelial injury, immune cell infiltration and myofibroblastic / osteogenic differentiation of cells that can
ultimately result in valve leaflet thickening and profound calcification. The fibrosis and calcification stiffen the
leaflets and can result in leaflet fusion that reduces valve opening and causes valve stenosis. Understanding
the molecular mechanisms that drive these changes might lead to the development of much needed therapies
for CAVD. In the past funding period we made mouse models to study the roles of a bioactive lipid,
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in cardiovascular and metabolic disease processes. In the course of these studies
we found that mice deficient in the enzyme autotaxin (ATX) that generates LPA were protected from valve
calcification and thickening in a commonly used experimental model. We also observed that mice lacking the
enzyme lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3) that can inactivate LPA exhibited greater valve calcification in
this model. These findings are likely translatable to humans because LPP3 levels are decreased during
development of human CAVD while ATX accumulates in the valve tissue and ATX binds to lipoprotein (a)
particles which are themselves associated with CAVD risk. Valvular Interstitial Cells (VICs) are resident cells of
the heart valve tissue that are normally responsible for maintaining the integrity of the heart valves. Pathological
differentiation of these cells to myofibroblastic and osteogenic phenotypes is central to the development of
CAVD. Consistent with literature reports, our preliminary data shows that mouse and human VICs express LPA
selective cell surface receptors. Differentiation of these cells to an osteogenic phenotype and subsequent
calcification can be readily observed in culture medium containing serum which is a rich source of LPA.
Pharmacological antagonism of LPA receptors blocks osteogenic differentiation and calcification of these cells
in culture. In the past funding period we characterized transcriptional circuits that regulate LPP3 expression to
understand why expression is increased in inflammation and decreased by heritable variants that associate with
increased coronary artery disease risk. These studies provide reagents and a framework for understanding why
LPP3 expression is decreased in CAVD. Here we propose to test the broad hypothesis that LPA signaling
promotes CAVD. We will test this hypothesis by using mouse models with cell and tissue type selective
inactivation of LPA receptors, LPP3 and ATX to identify the cell and tissue types involved the permissive effect
of LPA on CAVD with a particular interest in the possibility that secreted ATX and cell surface LPP3 could have
non cell autonomous effects on this process. As an orthogonal approach, we will use well characterized
experimental therapeutics (ATX inhibitors and LPA receptor antagonists) to validate results from these gene
knockout models and evaluate their potential for pharmacological intervention in CAVD. Studies in mouse
models will be augmented by experiments using cultured mouse and human VICs where again cells with genetic
deficiencies or treatment with small molecule therapeutics can be used to define the role of LPA signaling in
osteogenic differentiation and calcification. We will also examine how LPP3 expression is regulated during these
processes and test specific hypotheses about why LPP3 expression is decreased during development of CAVD.
This research will provide important new information about a pharmacologically tractable lipid signaling pathway
that appears to be central to the development of CAVD. This information could lead to new approaches for non-
surgical management of CAVD in Veterans."

 Recently, it was found that the enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) is overexpressed in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary malignancy of the liver and the 2nd leading cause
of cancer-related death in men (6th in women) worldwide. There are relatively few molecules known to inhibit
the activity of OAT, and those that have been reported focus on their ability to increase the concentration of
ornithine as a potential treatment for acute ammonia intoxications and hepatogenic encephalopathy. The
objective of this proposal is to use computer modeling, based on the known crystal structures of human OAT
and other PLP-dependent enzymes with our previously-active inactivators bound, to assist in the design of new
inactivators of OAT that are selective against other related enzymes to lower the potential of side effects from
off-target inhibition. Modifications to our earlier compounds will be made to improve on potency and
pharmacokinetic properties. The mechanisms of those compounds that selectively inactivate OAT will be
investigated. X-ray crystal structures of the inactivators bound to OAT will be obtained by our collaborator, Dr.
Dali Liu, to assist in further structural modifications. Compounds that are potent and selective inactivators of
OAT will be tested by Dr. Wenan Qiang against several cancer cell lines also found to overexpress OAT and
carry out PDX studies with the most effective compounds. He also will corroborate that the compounds inhibit
secretion of alpha-fetoprotein, a biomarker for HCC, and that OAT is the target. The goal is to identify one or
more compounds that are selective inhibitors/inactivators of OAT that suppress the growth of HCC, and other
cancers that overexpress OAT, in animals. These compounds would be first-in-class treatments for HCC, a
cancer that is highly resistant to both standard cancer chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and the prognosis
for recovery is very poor, as well as other OAT-expressing cancers."

Cell and Molecular Biology (CMB) is a unique, interdisciplinary Ph.D. training program that allows students to
explore the diverse landscape of biomedical research at Duke University before committing to a specific area of
research focus. The required first-semester curriculum follows a modular format that promotes exploration; the
required spring curriculum focuses on experimental design and modern cell and molecular techniques. Students
must complete three research rotations during the first year, which become the basis for choosing a mentor for
thesis research. In the second year, a grant-writing course is required in the fall and a written thesis proposal
must be orally presented and defended by the end of the spring semester. Additional in-depth training is obtained
through elective courses and thesis research. Students receive extensive instruction in the Responsible Conduct
of Research and in Rigor and Reproducibility, which is integrated throughout graduate training, and lab-safety
training is required yearly. Student progress and milestones are tracked and assessed using an app-based
tracking tool developed at Duke. To enrich the training experience and promote teamwork, first-year students
are mentored by second-year students, students organize annual recruitment activities, and students
collaboratively plan a yearly Symposium that brings experts to campus and celebrates research
accomplishments of CMB students. The CMB program is led by a Director and a Director of Graduate Studies
who embody the breadth of scientific expertise within the program, are at different career stages and have
complementary strengths. Additional program oversight is provided by an Executive Committee that broadly
represents the constituent faculty. There are 110 CMB training faculty, each of whom is required to take
mentoring and diversity-equity-inclusion training before students can affiliate with the corresponding lab. CMB
receives 200-300 student applications yearly; GRE scores are not required, and applicants are reviewed using
a standardized, holistic rubric. There are currently 98 graduate students at Duke who matriculated through CMB,
70 of whom are training-grant eligible. This group size creates a strong social and intellectual network that
enhances scientific exchange and encourages the use of multidisciplinary approaches. Sixteen training slots are
requested to maintain this robust program size, with selected students to be supported by the grant in years two
and three. The average time-to-degree for CMB students is 6.0 years and extensive professional development
resources are available that emphasize the exposure to and preparation for diverse scientific careers. The
overarching goal of the CMB program is to provide all students with a safe, inclusive, equitable and rigorous
training experience that provides the technical, operational and professional skills needed to become
independent and valuable members of the biomedical workforce."

 The Neuroscience Training Program (NTP) at Johns Hopkins University was established in 1983 to
provide students with advanced instruction and research training in fundamental neuroscience and the basis of
neurological diseases. It now includes 73 training faculty in 14 different departments across the university, as
well as several associated institutes where neuroscience research is performed and the Janelia Research
Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The program encompasses a broad array of research areas,
including molecular, cellular, developmental, sensory, systems, cognitive and computational neuroscience, as
well as neurobiology of disease, providing diverse training options and unique opportunities for collaboration
for our students. We typically matriculate 14-16 Ph.D. candidates each year, from a pool of >500 applicants,
and 1-4 additional candidates for combined MD/Ph.D. degrees (who are admitted through a separate process).
The program is currently supported by eight slots from this T32, as well as institutional funds through the
Department of Neuroscience. Students enter the program with diverse backgrounds ranging from computer
science to biochemistry. To ensure that they learn the basic tenets of neuroscience, they are required to take
a year-long integrative lecture and laboratory course, “Neuroscience and Cognition"", and receive rigorous
formal training in quantitative methods, statistics, rigor and reproducibility and neurological diseases. Students
learn about research opportunities through a mini-symposium series led by Program Faculty (featuring short
chalk talks), the Program Retreat, and Lab Lunches (which feature work-in-progress by NTP faculty). This
information is used to help students arrange three 8-12-week laboratory rotations, which are typically
completed by the end of the first academic year, and form the basis for selecting a thesis advisor. By the end
of the second year, students have completed three elective courses, from 18 small seminar-style courses in
different neuroscience specialties or relevant courses offered in other departments. In the spring of Year 2,
students write and defend a Thesis Proposal that is written in the form of a Predoctoral NRSA application, and
are tested on their understanding of the broader topic area and methods for analysis and reproducibility. Each
student is advised by two Pre-thesis Advisors in Years 1-2 (at 3 month intervals) and an individualized Thesis
Advisory Committee thereafter (at 6 month intervals). Students complete an Individual Development Plan
annually and discuss this with their advisor and the Thesis Advisory Committee. The Graduate Program
Steering Committee meets quarterly to carefully track the advancement of each student in the program and
establish overall program policy. Currently, 84 students are enrolled in the NTP and the average time to
complete the Ph.D. for the past ten years is 6.0 years. Of the students who have graduated from our program,
93% are pursuing careers in a science or medicine-related field. Here, we request funds to support five
students during their first two years in the program (10 slots)."
10836400,"With the introduction of reperfusion therapy, mortality from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has decreased
markedly, from 20% in 1980 to 5% in 2008, but has plateaued, despite the fact that our time to reperfusion is more rapid.
Now, post AMI congestive heart failure (CHF) is increasing due to reduced myocardial salvage and greater infarct size;
the leading cause is microvascular obstruction (MVO). Its presence, independent of age, infarct size, and ejection
fraction, is associated with worse clinical outcomes. It results in lower post AMI ejection fraction and is felt to be
the single most important contributor to post AMI CHF. In my first R01 (ESI status), we demonstrated that ultrasound
targeted microbubble cavitation (UTMC) can relieve MVO via sonoreperfusion (SRP), and that specific mechanical
mechanisms underly this phenomenon. Importantly, we also showed that nitric oxide (NO) is a crucial part of this
reperfusion efficacy, evidenced by a more than 50% reduction in reperfusion during blockade of NO. NO has
multi-level therapeutic potential, specifically for MVO, owing to its crucial role in numerous signaling and
regulatory pathways. Moreover, there is abundant data showing that increasing NO bioavailability during AMI
promotes myocardial salvage. Our preliminary data shows that UTMC can be used to increase NO bioavailability
and leveraged for optimization of the therapeutic efficacy of SRP by: (1) stimulating endogenous NO release
from both endothelial cells and red blood cells; (2) using intravascular microbubbles to deliver focal payloads of
an exogenous NO donor, sodium nitrite, to the obstructed microvasculature that result in synergistic NO output
and markedly enhanced NO bioavailability. Our ultimate goal is to use UTMC adjunctively, post PCI, to maximize
microvascular perfusion and minimize oxidative stress in order to attain the highest level of myocardial salvage.
 Accordingly, in AIM 1, we will tune UTMC to optimize endogenous NO output from both endothelial cells
and red blood cells. In AIM 2, we will develop a novel nitrite-loaded microbubble to enhance targeted delivery
of exogenous NO. We will perform mechanistic cellular studies to determine whether the synergy observed
between UTMC and nitrite is mediated through the AMPK pathway. Finally, in AIM 3, we will determine whether
NO-optimized UTMC with nitrite-loaded microbubbles will enhance SRP efficacy in a clinically relevant porcine
model of AMI and MVO. For clinical translation, we will compare reperfusion efficacy of this optimized UTMC
regime to a treatment strategy utilizing diagnostic high mechanical index UTMC with commercially available
microbubbles, currently being explored in clinical trials.
 This strategy of using SRP adjunctively following PCI is promising and represents a paradigm shift in our
treatment of AMI. It provides a means to offer patients complete vascular patency, not just of the epicardial
culprit artery with stenting, but also of the microcirculation, which is crucial to effect maximal salvage. By further
optimization of UTMC, we will attain the highest level of safety and efficacy, and improve patient outcome."

10838600,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 An osseointegrated prosthesis is a novel alternative to a prosthesis socket that directly mounts the prosthesis
to the residual limb through a bone anchored implant, which improves the load transmission between the ground
and residual limb. Proper loading at the bone-implant interface is critical to long-term outcome as underloading
can lead to implant loosening and overloading can lead to periprosthetic fracture. Preliminary outcome evidence
is highly promising regarding improvements in function and quality of life following prosthesis osseointegration
compared to a traditional socket; however, mechanical failure due to implant loosening or fracture persists in a
small subset of this population, which can have devastatingly negative impacts on the patient.
 Although bone-implant loading has a direct impact on outcome, it cannot be measured in-vivo. As a result,
finite element models are the most widely used surrogate to estimate bone-implant loading. However, these prior
models have three primarily limitations that impede their clinical utility: 1) they have not included activities of daily
living, 2) they have not incorporated muscle forces, and 3) they have not been developed for transtibial
osseointegrated prostheses. The first goal of this proposal is to leverage an existing dataset that will
develop a state-of-the-art modeling platform that will quantify bone-implant interface loading in patients
with transfemoral and transtibial osseointegrated prostheses during activities of daily living.
 Rehabilitation following prosthesis osseointegration involves progression of mechanical loading through
gradual increase in weight bearing and strengthening exercises designed to promote bone remodeling to prepare
the bone and implant to sustain loads required for daily living. Further on in the healing stage, gait retraining is
prescribed to retrain the movement patterns of the patient as they habituate to the new ability to directly load the
residual bone. Although rehabilitation is pivotal to optimize patient outcome, it remains hindered by a lack of
empirical data that results in protocols being not well defined, lacking validation, and not specific to amputation
level. The second goal of this proposal will be to establish the effects of simulated rehabilitation on bone-
implant interface loading in patients with transtibial and transtibial osseointegrated prostheses.
 This proposal will be the first to quantify dynamic bone-implant interface loading in osseointegrated
prostheses while incorporating subject-specific movement, muscle, and joint forces (Aim 1) and to assess the
effects of rehabilitation on these loading patterns (Aim 2). Because mechanical failures are largely due to
pathologic loading at the bone-implant interface, understanding how it is altered by amputation level, activity,
and rehabilitation following prosthesis osseointegration is critical to optimizing outcomes in this population. As
prosthesis osseointegration gains in awareness, evidence regarding its effect on the musculoskeletal system is
critically needed to make this promising prosthesis more accessible to a broader population."

 For the more than 5.5 million people in the U.S. who use wheelchairs as their primary mode of ambulation,
there is a pervasive lack of research on reducing cardiometabolic risk through structured exercise.
Confirmatory analyses have revealed that wheelchair users live predominantly sedentary lifestyles and have
substantially higher cardiometabolic risk factors compared to the general population. Although few exercise
training studies have investigated cardiometabolic risk in certain subgroups with a disability, small sample
sizes and homogeneous groups limit the translatability of this knowledge into clinical practice risk reduction
strategies for wheelchair users. To address these issues, we propose to use a robust remote training system
with built-in videoconferencing and real-time monitoring of vital sign data
(e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate).
This procedure will allow us to examine the efficacy of an evidence-based Movement-to-Music (M2M) program
adapted for telehealth delivery and cardio emphasis (M2M-C). We are proposing a two-arm randomized
controlled trial including 132 wheelchair users with a poor cardiometabolic profile (e.g., elevated triglycerides)
recruited through our established network of clinics serving this population. The long-term goal of this proposal
is to develop an effective and enjoyable modality for promoting health-enhancing exercise for wheelchair users
by confirming exercise dose requirements for this underrepresented group. The primary aim will examine the
average treatment effects of a 24-week M2M-C program on core indicators of CMH in wheelchair users with ≥
2 cardiometabolic risk factors. CMH outcomes will be measured via blood tests (i.e., high sensitivity C-reactive
protein, hemoglobin, fasting insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol) and DEXA scan (i.e., body composition) at
baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of synchronous M2M-C training. The secondary aim will explore the
beneficial effects of M2M-C on cardiovascular capacity, physical activity, and quality of life. Cardiovascular
capacity will be measured via peak oxygen consumption. Physical activity and quality of life will be measured
by self-report instruments validated for this population. The tertiary aim 1 is to evaluate the sustained effects
of M2M-C (24 to 36 weeks) on physical activity. After M2M participants complete the 24-week program, they
will be instructed to perform asynchronous exercise training using guided M2M online videos for an additional
12 weeks. The tertiary aim 2 is to examine the heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE), which aims to
understand whom the intervention is most effective."
10766160,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bacteria are bombarded by infecting viruses, called phages, in natural habitats. Upon infection of a host, phages
must undertake one of two lifestyles: lysogeny where the phage remains in the host and is passed down to
offspring, or lysis where the phage replicates, kills the host, and spreads to new cells. Phages have been thought
to transition from lysogeny to lysis exclusively in response to host stress and DNA damage. New research from
the Bassler laboratory has revealed that phages can monitor host communication molecules, called
autoinducers. In a process called quorum sensing, bacteria produce, release, and detect autoinducers, and in
response, orchestrate group behaviors. Quorum-sensing-responsive phages detect host-produced autoinducers
and exploit the information they garner to drive their lysis-lysogeny lifestyle transitions. These recent findings
position me to discover how phages manipulate bacterial hosts and the consequences to the host, to the multi-
species bacterial community of which the host is a member, and to the eukaryotic host in which all the entities
reside. The overarching goal of my research is to define how cross-domain communication between vibriophage
VP882, the first phage discovered to “eavesdrop” on quorum sensing, and its host, the global pathogen Vibrio
cholerae, launches the phage lytic cycle. Using a combination of genetic, biochemical, and structural
approaches, I will identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this host-phage chemical communication
process. First, I will learn skills in bacterial genetics from experts in the Bassler laboratory and conduct a genetic
screen to identify the repressor of the quorum-sensing-induced phage lytic cycle. Second, I will use biochemical
methods to quantitatively characterize interactions between two key signaling components in the quorum-
sensing-induced phage lysis pathway. Lastly, I will rely on my background in structural biology to solve the
structures of these same signaling components, individually and in complex, enabling atomic-level-resolution
understanding of the interactions required for the phage to undergo lifestyle transitions. The ideal outcomes of
my research are a mechanistic understanding of inter-domain chemical communication and new possibilities for
development of phage therapies. Honing my skills in bacterial genetics, protein biochemistry, and
macromolecular crystallography over the course of my postdoctoral training will enable me to launch an
independent research program at a top-tier research institution."

 In their 2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed
Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile as an urgent threat. As the most common healthcare-associated
infection, it has an enormous impact on both the lives of individuals and the healthcare system at large.
Developing a C. difficile infection (CDI) is most often associated with the recent use of antibiotics, as broad
spectrum antibiotics can lead to a disruption of the normal gut microbiota, which in turn allows C. difficile spores
to germinate and overwhelm the remaining microbiome that normally keeps the vegetative C. difficile at bay.
Although the patient risk factors for CDI are fairly well understood, the potential roles of genetic variation in the
infecting strain in influencing the progression to severe CDI are less so. Given the extensive diversity in both the
nucleotide sequences of core genes and variation in gene content among common C. difficile strains, it is likely
that there are significant differences in how different strains of C. difficile interact with the host. Indeed, there
have been numerous reports of variation in the propensity for certain sequence types to cause severe disease,
although the genetic variation mediating strain-level differences is largely unknown.
 In this proposal I take a data driven approach to identify genetic variants influencing patient immune
responses and clinical trajectories. To accomplish this, I will leverage a massive data repository created through
comprehensive sampling of all C. difficile positive cases at Michigan Medicine. Included in this repository are
1,678 C. difficile whole genome sequenced isolates, associated processed electronic health record data from
1,516 patients, and banked serum during the instance of CDI for 1178 patients. Serum cytokine levels have
already been determined for 220 of these patients. Preliminary studies conducted in support of this proposal
demonstrate that variation encoded in the genomes of infecting strains are predictive of both initial patient
immune responses and subsequent severe infections, supporting the contribution of strain genetic background
to patient clinical trajectories. I will build upon these studies and attempt to identify the specific variants, genes
and pathways that are mediating variation in clinical outcomes. To this end I will employ a combination of
machine learning and bacterial genome-wide association studies (bGWAS) to gain insight into bacterial genetic
features that influence patient immune response as quantified by serum cytokine measurements, as well as
bacterial genetic variation associated with severe outcomes. I will then validate these bioinformatic findings by
evaluating the accuracy of model predictions by comparison of predicted and actual 1) cytokine measures on
withheld serum samples, and 2) in vivo severity outcome in a mouse model of CDI. The resulting understanding
of the genetic factors of C. difficile that impact patient cytokine response and severity outcome can then be
leveraged to improve current treatment strategies, as well as indicate novel targets for therapy against CDI."

Having a sense of belonging is vital to children’s and adults’ psychological health. In fact, lack of belonging is
detrimental to children’s psychological health, causing acute and chronic distress and increasing risk for later
anxiety/depressive symptoms and drug use. This fundamental need to belong can be undermined or
strengthened by social experiences, such as gossiping (i.e., negative or positive talk about others). The effects
of gossiping are well-studied in both adults and adolescents; members of both age groups who are associated
with negative gossip feel less connected in their friend groups than those who are associated with positive
gossip. Yet, no study to date has investigated the immediate and long-term effects of gossip on feelings
of belonging at younger ages. The present proposal aims to address this gap. To understand the link
between early childhood gossip and children’s social and psychological well-being, we aim to identify
how spreading gossip or being the target of gossip impacts children’s feelings of belonging.
The overall objectives will be achieved through two lab studies (Studies 1 and 2) and one naturalistic study
(Study 3). Study 1 will use a novel experimental paradigm to identify the immediate effects of spreading gossip
on children’s belonging and distress by testing the hypotheses that 1a) Children will feel closer to their
conversation partners and feel less distressed if they gossip with them, and 1b) Children will feel closer to the
peers who were the targets of positive gossip than peers who were the targets of negative gossip. Study 2 will
use a similar experimental design to identify the immediate effects of being the target of gossip on children’s
belonging and distress, by testing the hypothesis that 2) Children who are the targets of negative gossip will
experience lower belonging and feel more distressed than the children who are the targets of positive gossip.
In a novel analysis of an already collected observational social network dataset from classrooms, Study 3 will
map long-term social network implications of children’s gossip over the course of an entire school year. Study
3 will test the hypotheses that 3a) Children who have higher connectedness (i.e., belonging) among friends will
be less involved in spreading negative gossip and have lower likelihood of being a target of negative gossip,
and 3b) Children who are more centrally connected to the friend group will be more involved in spreading
positive gossip and have higher likelihood of being a target of positive gossip. The proposed research and
training aims will identify the functions and impact of gossip on children’s feelings of belonging and distress
and help the Candidate in furthering their career goals to lead their own lab as an independent PI. The findings
can contribute to programs and policies to support healthy social development by increasing children’s feelings
of belonging."

The objective of this application is to determine how tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) enzymatic
activity maintains cerebrovascular function within the neurovascular unit (NVU). Brain microvascular endothelial
cells (BMECs) comprise the cerebral microvasculature and serve as the structural foundation of the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) and. Increased permeability and diminished integrity of BMECs are two common mechanisms
through which cerebrovascular function is compromised in human disease. TNAP is a highly enriched enzyme
in cerebral microvessels whose function in brain BMECs is poorly understood. Our preliminary data demonstrate
that TNAP activity stimulates a novel signaling mechanism which protects against the loss of cerebral
microvascular integrity and permeability. These intriguing findings led us to propose the central hypothesis that
TNAP maintains NVU homeostasis during cerebral ischemia by preserving BBB integrity. We will utilize mice
with a VE-cadherin-Cre driven conditional deletion of TNAP in endothelial cells (VEcKO) and its wild type
littermates to interrogate the role of TNAP in BMECs. We will compare responses in young (4-5 months) and
aged (18-20 months) mice to assess the age-dependent effects of brain endothelial TNAP on indices of brain
endothelial barrier permeability combined with vascular network analysis and functional behavioral outcomes.
Aim 1 will elucidate the contribution of brain endothelial cell TNAP to NVU dysfunction in ischemic stroke in
young mice. We will employ the transient middle artery occlusion model to assess quantitative differences in
cerebrovascular outcomes and behavioral indices. Aim 2 will determine the impact of brain endothelial cell TNAP
on age-dependent impairment of the NVU. This aim will assess the impact TNAP on BMEC function in aging
and the putative age-dependent interactions in ischemic stroke. Aim 3 will determine how the TNAP-Rho
associated kinase (ROCK) pathway regulates the barrier function and whether pharmacological inhibition of the
ROCK pathway protects against the loss of barrier integrity and functional deficits associated ischemic stroke in
both young and aged mice. Taken together, the studies in this proposal will delineate a novel mechanism through
which brain endothelial cell TNAP enzyme activity preserves NVU function in ischemic stroke and improves
functional recovery post-stroke. The overall results will contribute to our limited understanding of the basic
biology of TNAP’s role at the BBB and its contribution to NVU homeostasis in human health and disease."

Depression, non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) commonly emerge in
youth and each represent important risk factors for death by suicide. Early detection and intervention has the
promise of altering trajectories, improving adult outcomes and preventing suicide. Brain networks implicated in
depression (frontal-limbic threat, cortico-striatal approach/reward and default mode) undergo significant
change during childhood and adolescence; the manner of how these changes unfold may be critical to
understanding the onset and course of depression, NSSI, and STB. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development (ABCD) is a population-based study that is following over 11,000 children annually over 10
years, with clinical and neuroimaging data from the first three years already publicly available. Since ABCD
data collection spans a critical developmental window notable for significant rises in depression, NSSI and
STB, analyzing this data presents an ideal opportunity to characterize the links between neural network
changes and unfolding risk for suicide in youth. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) can be used to characterize brain
network structure and organization. While our laboratory and others have extensively applied standard
functional connectivity methods to characterize strength within depression networks using cross-sectional
designs, longitudinal designs are needed to understand now aberrant development in network strength may
contribute to onset depression, NSSI and STB. Recently, novel approaches have emerged to estimate
network flexibility from rsfMRI data. These include drawing from information theory to measure entropy of
brain signals and from dynamic connectivity analyses to measure state-switching, or shifts between brain
network configurations during rest. Our preliminary data point to inverse relationships between brain flexibility
(entropy and state-switching frequency) and depression, NSSI and STB in adolescents, suggesting a potential
neural mechanism for getting “stuck” in negative ways of thinking and feeling. We propose that individual
differences in the trajectory of neural network strength and flexibility changes across childhood and
adolescence may help explain the emergence of depression and suicide risk in adolescents. In our conceptual
model, inherited and environmental factors shape network developmental trajectories, which in turn underlie
the emergence of depression, NSSI and STB. This proposal seeks to delineate the neurodevelopmental
trajectories of strength and flexibility in fronto-limbic threat, cortico-striatal approach/reward and default mode
networks associated with the risk, onset and early course of depression, NSSI and STB in children and
adolescents in the ABCD study using novel analytic strategies. New insights from this study will provide the
foundation for designing personalized interventions to facilitate early detection of depression and suicide risk,
and to guide interventions capable of restoring healthy brain development and averting serious negative
outcomes including suicide."

Pathological expansion of fibroblasts in the synovial tissue surrounding the joint drive disease in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA). Recent studies have identified molecularly and functionally distinct
phenotypes of synovial fibroblasts using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). One of the phenotypes,
found exclusively in the lining compartment of the synovium and expanded in both RA and OA, has been
implicated in tissue destruction in vivo. Previous studies have shown that synovial fibroblast phenotypes are
plastic, making them potentially inducible with biological therapies but difficult to study in vitro, as they lose
their phenotypes ex vivo. I propose two novel strategies to model the induction and maintenance of the
synovial lining phenotype. Preliminary analyses prioritized TGF𝛽 , a cytokine known to drive fibroblast
differentiation, in both strategies. The first strategy builds on the notion that fibroblast phenotypes are in
dynamic equilibrium and exist at multiple stages of induction in human tissue. Aim 2 will model these states in
over 100,000 fibroblasts from 108 synovial donor biopsies with the novel RNA velocity algorithm to infer lining
fibroblast differentiations processes and nominate driver genes. Aim 2 will either perform 108 separate
analyses combined through meta-analysis or do one joint analysis with Crescendo, to be developed in aim 1
as the first multi-donor RNA velocity analysis. The second strategy builds on preliminary data that show that
genes activated in phenotype induction are inactivated during phenotype loss ex vivo. Aim 3 will directly
experimentally assay the dynamics of phenotype loss ex vivo, profiling 150,000 fibroblast at multiple time
points with scRNAseq. Aim 3a will test the efficacy of exogenous TGF𝛽 stimulation to maintain the lining
phenotype ex vivo. Aim 3b will nominate and test more pathways from sophisticated analysis of the generated
time-course data. Together, these aims will identify molecular drivers of the lining phenotype and fuel novel
research on therapeutics to target lining fibroblasts.
 I have expertise in single cell computational biology and synovial fibroblast genomics. I developed the
popular Harmony algorithm for single cell integration, published in Nature Methods and co-first authored a
paper detailing the induction of a novel fibroblast subtype necessary for arthritic disease in vivo, in press at
Nature. Completing the proposed research will help me build my analytical skills with time-course data analysis
and develop invaluable skills in experimental fibroblast biology. I will train Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri, in
statistical analyses, co-mentor Dr. Michael Brenner, expert in synovial fibroblast biology, advisor Dr. Peter
Kharchenko, developer of RNA velocity, advisor Dr. Fiona Powrie, director of the Kennedy Institute for
Rheumatology, and advisor Dr. Christopher Buckley, expert in synovial fibroblast biology. With this multi-
disciplinary training, I will be become a principal investigator applying computational and experimental methods
to translational rheumatology research."
10763410,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Amacrine cells (ACs) are the principle inhibitory neurons of the inner retina, with at least 45 morphologically
distinct subtypes that can be distinguished by the size, shape, and stratification of their dendritic arbors within
the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Most ACs do not have axons, and instead integrate signaling across their
dendritic arbors. This unique arrangement means that form and function are intimately related in ACs,
perhaps more so than in any other neuron type. However, we know virtually nothing about how individual AC
subtypes are specified during development, or how their adopt their stereotyped morphologies. We hypothesize
that selectively expressed transcription factors (TFs) are well poised to direct subtype-specific genetic programs
that specify and direct the morphological maturation of ACs. Within the AC population, the homeodomain TF
Isl1 is only expressed in starburst amacrine cells (SACs) and Gbx2 is only expressed in a previously unidentified
population of medium-field non-GABAeric, non-Glycinergic ACs (MF-nGnGs). Our preliminary results show
that early deletion of Isl1 or Gbx2 from AC precursors results in defects in SAC and MF-nGnG subtype
specification, respectively. Later deletion of Isl1 or Gbx2 in post-migratory SACs or MF-nGnGs alters their
dendritic morphology and stratification patterns. Therefore, Isl1 and Gbx2 appear to be required for the initial
specification and the subsequent morphological maturation of their respective AC subtypes. We will test this in
the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine whether Isl1 and Gbx2 are necessary and sufficient for AC subtype
specification and maturation. We will use conditional loss- and gain-of function approaches to determine
whether Isl1 and Gbx2 are both necessary and sufficient to initiate and maintain terminal differentiation in
SACs and MF-nGnGs, respectively. Furthermore, we will use a combination of genomic approaches (RNASeq,
ATACseq) to identify the Isl1 and Gbx2 gene regulator networks in the respective AC subtypes. 2) Define how
Isl1 and Gbx2 regulate SAC and MF-nGnG morphology and functional connectivity. We will first identify how
the loss of Isl1 in SACs and Gbx2 in MF-nGnGs affects the development of their stereotyped dendritic
morphology and stratification patterns. Then we will test candidate effector genes and pathways for their
involvement in the establishment of dendritic arbors. Finally, we will determine how the loss of Isl1 and Gbx2
affects the functional connectivity of SACs and MF-nGnGs in visual circuits. Together, these experiments are
expected to reveal how selectively expressed transcription factors specify AC subtypes and drive terminal
differentiation programs that endow ACs with their unique morphological properties. We expect that these
findings will reveal principles that are broadly applicable across the developing nervous system."

Campylobacter is among the principal causes of bacterial enteritis worldwide and the progressive development
of antimicrobial resistance among global isolates, particularly in low and middle income countries, has led the
CDC to list drug-resistant Campylobacter at the top of its list of serious threats in 2019. In the past decade in
Europe major investments in genomic epidemiology have informed successful interventions to decrease rates
of human infection and sequelae such as Guillan-Barre syndrome. Despite clear evidence that Campylobacter
is a principal cause of enteritis in the developing world, advanced approaches in source attribution have not
been employed to identify the principal sources of infection causing disease in humans, or to identify the
sources of human infections resistant to both fluoroquinolones and azithromycin (MDR Campylobacter),
despite their documented high incidence. The limited genomic study of Campylobacter done in low and middle
income countries demonstrates important differences in the genomes of isolates from both humans and
zoonotic sources, indicating that transmission dynamics differ in these settings compared to that seen in high
income countries. The current deficit in accurate quantitative source attribution to zoonotic source populations
where most infections occur is a critical knowledge gap in the global control of Campylobacter infections. The
objective of this project is to inform targeted disease control measures to reduce the impact of
campylobacteriosis and human MDR Campylobacter in low and middle income countries. Our central
hypothesis is that industrially produced meat products are the principal source of campyobacteriosis and MDR
Campylobacter in humans in this population. In order to test our central hypothesis we will 1) identify host
segregating features of Campylobacter from zoonotic sources in Peru; 2) characterize genomes of
Campylobacter strains that cause disease in humans, evaluate the risk of household peron-to-person
transmission and identify microbial genomic features associated with persistent asymptomatic human carriage
and 3) estimate the burden of campylobacteriosis and human MDR infections attributable to domestic and
industrially derived zoonotic sources. The proposed project will unite a highly complementary group of
accomplished researchers with expertise in epidemiology, Campylobacter genomics, bioinformatics and
microbial ecology to inform strategic and targeted disease control interventions for Campylobacter control in an
area with one of the highest documented rates of human MDR Campylobacter infection. The project is
innovative in its approach to link characterized human cases and zoonotic reservoirs in a high burden LMIC
setting to local, regional, and global reference genomes to create robust evidence to drive policy and practice
to improve the control of campylobacteriosis and the diminish the geographic expansion of MDR
Campylobacter."
10819151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiac disease and causes
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) – e.g., arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden
cardiac death. Invasive interventions to prevent MACE are available but can cause
complications. Current risk stratification strategy has limited power to predict which patient
would develop MACE and benefit most from preventive interventions. Furthermore, little is
known about the signaling pathways through which gene mutations mediate HCM pathogenesis
and MACE. These major knowledge gaps have hindered efforts to prevent MACE in HCM. The
Harvard-Columbia Multi-center Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM2) Biorepository is an
ongoing 3-center cohort study that enrolled 560 patients with HCM during 2014-2020. In this
large multi-center HCM biorepository, investigators have collected high-quality biospecimens –
e.g., plasma, left ventricular myocardium. Follow-up data include biannual interviews, medical
record reviews, and in-person exam every year, with >85% follow-up to date (median follow-up,
3.1 years). The present R01 project will extend this large well-characterized HCM biorepository
by proteomically profiling both plasma and myocardium samples, and by examining their
relations to both HCM disease status and MACE. In Aim 1, we will examine the association of
signaling pathway dysregulation in the myocardium with HCM disease status using molecular
biology approach (e.g., RT-PCR of mRNA, ELISA) and proteomics profiling. In Aim 2, we will
determine the association of signaling pathway dysregulation with MACE using proteomics
profiling, and specify signaling pathways that predict incident MACE. Finally, using a systems
biology approach, Aim 3 will define HCM subtypes by integrating proteomic, genetic, and clinical
data, and determine their associations with MACE. Our prior study and preliminary work lend
compelling support to our hypotheses. The present R01 project will provide a unique opportunity
to reveal the molecular mechanisms of HCM pathogenesis and progression to MACE through
examining signaling pathways using proteomics profiling in both plasma and myocardium.
Furthermore, the proposed study will also invent a novel risk stratification system in HCM, which
will allow us to precisely identify high-risk HCM subpopulations that would benefit from
preventive interventions. The project will provide a strong evidence base for developing targeted
pharmacotherapies to prevent HCM pathogenesis and MACE through the modulation of specific
signaling pathways. The investigators have integrated and complementary expertise in all
relevant fields. The study matches well with the NHLBI strategic plan for HCM research."

This project is responsive to NOT-MD-19-001 Notice of Special Interest in Research on the Health of Sexual and
Gender Minority (SGM) Populations. Gender minority populations are at increased risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. Specifically, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data suggest
that, compared to cisgender people, gender minorities are at more than double the risk for myocardial infarction
and report greater depression, physical inactivity, and elevated body mass index (BMI), as well as poorer access
to healthcare, all of which increase CVD risk. Further, many gender minority individuals take hormones, which
may further increase their risk of CVD. According to minority stress theory, the negative impact of prejudice and
discrimination is one contributor to CVD risk disparities. Although previous studies have found associations
between gender minority stress and poorer self-reported mental health, the impact of minority stress on physical
health outcomes, including CVD risk, has not been examined in gender minority populations. The goal of this
study is to advance our understanding of how minority stress and resilience affect CVD risk. In an established
longitudinal, multisite cohort of gender minority individuals in three U.S. cities (N=390), we aim to: (1)
determine the association of minority stress with mental health and CVD risk; (2) determine the impact of social
support, access to care, and identity development on mental health and CVD risk; and (3) identify modifiable
resilience factors that may influence the relationship of minority stress to mental health and CVD risk in this
health disparity population. In addition to structured interviews and Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA)
of stress and resilience at baseline and 2-year follow-up, we will collect 2-week bursts of objective measurements
of blood pressure, sleep and physical activity. The proposed research will provide the best evidence to date to
guide researchers and clinicians working to develop interventions to reduce CVD disparities in gender minority
populations, and promote their long-term health and wellbeing.

10762334,"Preterm birth is the leading cause of mortality in infants under age one, resulting in over one million neonatal
deaths annually. Surviving preterm infants experience increased risk of infection, neurodevelopmental disorders,
and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease. Maternal extra-uterine infections, such as urinary tract infection
(UTI), are associated with increased risk for preterm birth; however, the host-microbe dynamics in UTI-
associated preterm birth are not well-described. To study this phenomenon, we have developed a murine model
of UTI-associated preterm birth with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), the causative agent of over 70% of UTIs.
In our model, approximately half of dams went into preterm labor while remaining dams did not go into labor
before the experimental end point. This bimodal phenotype enables us to uniquely investigate factors
contributing to preterm birth incidence. Preterm dams exhibited decreased bladder and placental bacterial
burdens and increased fetal demise. Further, preterm birth was maintained when dams were infected with UV-
inactivated bacteria, suggesting preterm birth is attributed to inflammation rather than bacterial dissemination.
Additionally, placentae from preterm mice expressed elevated MIP2, a murine neutrophil chemokine, implicating
neutrophils in preterm birth pathogenesis. This led us to the hypothesis that UTI-associated preterm birth
is attributed to localized bladder inflammation and distinct systemic and reproductive immune profiles
in preterm dams compared to term dams. This hypothesis will be investigated through two aims: one which
compares localized bladder immune response in preterm and term dams, and one which elucidates divergences
in maternal systemic and reproductive immune profiles in UTI-associated term and preterm pregnancy. Aim 1
couples unbiased, multiplexed immune profiling in the bladder of term and preterm mice with targeted depletion
of LPS and neutrophils, two components implicated in preterm birth and adverse neonatal outcomes. Aim 2
seeks to understand the maternal immunological consequences of UTI and how they may be associated with
preterm birth by investigating maternal systemic, uterine, and placental immune cell composition and function.
We will utilize our novel murine model to investigate phenotypic changes in preterm birth incidence and adverse
fetal outcomes coupled with molecular mechanism through multiparameter flow cytometry and cytokine analysis.
These experiments will not only be the first to explore mechanisms that contribute to UTI-associated preterm
birth, but they will also be the first to comprehensively characterize the bladder immune response to infection
during pregnancy. The success of this work will reveal novel therapeutic opportunities to predict, reduce, or
prevent preterm birth. This proposal will allow the applicant to further develop her technical skills and knowledge
of immunology, while expanding her expertise to include murine models of infection and pregnancy and
reproductive biology. Ultimately, this work will equip the applicant with the experience necessary to advance her
career in academic research while addressing a critical gap in maternal and fetal health outcomes."

βII-spectrin (encoded by SPTBN1), is a ubiquitous component of the submembrane neuronal cytoskeleton. βII-
spectrin binds F-actin and ankyrins to organize complex networks of ion channels, membrane transporters and
cell adhesion molecules. βII-spectrin also promotes bidirectional transport of organelles and vesicles. Our lab
recently reported de novo SPTBN1 variants as the genetic cause of a developmental delay syndrome that is
comorbid with intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and seizures. However, the neuron types
and brain circuits most vulnerable to deficits in βII-spectrin function and their specific contribution to the diverse
neurological presentations are not fully elucidated. My preliminary studies indicate that βII-spectrin plays
important roles in modulating cerebellar function and that cerebellar dysfunction may contribute to the SPTBN1
syndrome. To begin to unravel the roles of βII-spectrin in the cerebellum, I will focus on investigating its function
in cerebellar granule cells by determining how βII-spectrin promotes: 1) the organization of excitable axonal
domains and 2) axonal organelle dynamics."

 Dopamine is an important neuromodulator that mediates learning from previous outcomes (“retrospective”
learning) by encoding reward prediction errors — the difference between experienced and expected rewards.
However, recent work has suggested that dopamine might use the prefrontal cortex to encode more abstract
prediction errors, such as errors about the hidden state of a task or environment. The exact circuit mechanisms
underlying these abstract hidden-state prediction errors remains unclear. This proposal has two major goals.
First, I will characterize dopamine activity related to hidden-state inference in rats performing a task with partially
observable states. Second, I will identify the circuit mechanisms that generate dopamine state prediction errors
in this task. I will use computational modeling and state-of-the-art genetic and viral tools, including fiber
photometry to measure dopamine activity and projection-specific chemogenetic silencing of prefrontal cortex, to
address these goals. I will measure dopamine activity both at the level of cell-body calcium dynamics, as well as
at the level of axonal release, which can be dissociated. This proposal will describe the multi-regional neural
circuits that underlie the acquisition and maintenance of abstract representations of the environment. The results
will provide insight into the pathology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, which are characterized by
disrupted reward processing.
 My co-sponsors at New York University (NYU), Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Paul Glimcher, have
complimentary experience in behavioral and systems neuroscience experiments in rats, and computational
modeling of decision-making, respectively. The training I will receive will allow me to pursue truly integrative
research that involves the close interplay between experiments and theory. The strong, collaborative
environment at NYU makes it an ideal place for me to pursue these research goals. My training plan provides a
detailed strategy for acquiring the necessary skills from a team of co-mentors with extensive, proven expertise
in the relevant techniques. Technical training, as well as frequent data presentations, attendance of professional
courses, seminars, and conferences, and development of my writing and leadership skills will equip me to
complete the proposed research, and transition to a post-doctoral position in my field of interest."

Head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are the seventh most common cancers globally and
are associated with poor survival rates. Pharmacological treatments for HNSCC remain largely ineffective and
improving drug therapies requires the identification of novel factors that modulate not just the tumor but also the
surrounding permissive oral microenvironment. One such novel factor may be the aging of the tissue. While
older age is associated with worse five-year survival for HNSCC, almost all preclinical cancer model studies
focus on outcomes in young animals. This discordance between preclinical adolescent in vivo models and largely
elderly target patient populations may underlie the poor efficacy of treatment for HNSCC. The goal of this
proposal is to define molecular events associated with HNSCC progression in aged tissues with the hope to
uncover targetable mechanisms that may offer new therapeutic avenues. To test the influence of age on HNSCC,
we optimized syngeneic orthotopic tongue xenograft models of HNSCC. We observed more rapid tumor growth
in old animals, with tumors exhibiting an age-associated, immune evasive, transcriptionally-distinct tumor cell
states as well as an age-associated collagen-secreting/modifying fibroblast population. A critical factor that may
be involved in these age-associated alterations is the transcriptional regulator Yes-associated protein (YAP), a
Hippo signaling effector that has a pro-tumorigenic role in HNSCC, including modulating the expression of genes
that track with disease progression and treatment resistance. YAP mediates transcriptional changes that
promote aggressive cell behavior and immune evasion, dynamics that may preferentially promote disease
severity in older patients. Furthermore, the transcriptome of old animals revealed distinct elevation of the Runt-
related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) in aged oral tumor cells. RUNX1 is a YAP DNA-binding partner and has
been implicated as a biomarker of worse HNSCC survival. We hypothesize that the aged oral tissue
microenvironment is permissive to tumorigenesis in part due to extracellular matrix dynamics that drive elevated
YAP and RUNX1 activity. In Aim 1, we will examine YAP-depleted and RUNX1-depleted tumor cell behavior in
old and young mice using genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses in our syngeneic orthotopic
xenograft models. Data collected from this aim will offer a comprehensive comparison of the role of YAP and
RUNX1 on the mediating age-associated alterations observed in HNSCC. In Aim 2, we will define age-associated
changes to lymphocytic and myeloid immune populations in the aged oral tumor niche and test the impact of
matrix stiffness on conferring these age-associated alterations to immune and tumor cell populations in our
syngeneic xenograft models. Data collected from this aim will provide a comprehensive assessment of age-
associated immune and mechanical tissue targets for potential future therapeutics in HNSCC. In addition, our
proposed plan provides an opportunity for diverse training in molecular, cellular and genetic biology, combined
with bioinformatics and translational medicine, honing the skills required for success as a physician-scientist."

This project will investigate deuterium (2H) metabolic imaging (DMI) as a quantitative, stable-isotope MR
molecular imaging approach to probe cerebral metabolic impairment in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). AD and
related dementias represent a growing public health concern with tremendous impact on patients and their
families. Efforts to treat AD effectively are partially confounded by different hypotheses regarding its initiation
and progression, as reflected by the range of highly informative imaging methods used to study AD, including
positron emission tomography (PET) and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dysfunctional glucose
metabolism is both an early and critical determinant of disease progression, and the glucose derivative
[18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been widely used to probe cerebral metabolism in AD patients. While this
may reflect a decrease in glucose demand, it does not inform on metabolism itself. Furthermore, FDG-PET has
significant limitations in accessibility, cost and accuracy, and provides no information on metabolic processes
beyond glucose uptake and phosphorylation. Thus, while FDG-PET shows the potential of a metabolic biomarker,
a sensitive and practical imaging method is critically needed.
Deuterium MRI is a novel and quantitative metabolic imaging approach that provides direct visualization of the
uptake and meteabolic fate of glucose on timescales and sensitivities that are not achievable with 1H or
hyperpolarized 13C MR spectroscopic imaging. Our initial data using DMI in a J20 mouse model of AD show that
reduced glucose metabolism to lactate and reduced HDO enrichment can be observed compared to age-
matched healthy controls. Building on these results, we propose to develop new DMI approaches for assessment
of glucose metabolism in the live brain, and validate these techniques in healthy and AD mice, as well as in
healthy volunteers. In Aim 1, we will investigate three separate strategies to assess glucose metabolism with 2H
MRI: metabolism using [6,6’-2H]glucose, HDO enrichment using [U-2H]glucose, and accumulation using [2,2’-
2H2]2-deoxyglucose. In Aim 2, we will apply these three approaches to preclinical models of AD and compare
results to FDG-PET. In Aim 3, we will develop hardware for human translation at 7T and will characterize brain
metabolism in healthy volunteers using [6,6’-2H]glucose and [U-2H]glucose. Successful completion of this project
will improve our understanding of glucose metabolism in AD, provide a foundation for future clinical studies in
patients with AD, improve clinical management, help refine therapy regimens and, ultimately lead to better
outcome and quality of life for people living with AD."
10852016,"ABSTRACT. The Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) Cohort is a well-characterized international cohort of
multi-generational families that from its inception in 1995 has supported interdisciplinary collaborative research.
Across six sites in the U.S., Canada, and Australia, we recruited and continue to follow 33,037 women and 6,992
men from 15,056 families. Unlike cohorts of unrelated individuals, the BCFR Cohort enables a broad and deep
investigation of factors that modify breast cancer susceptibility and affect outcomes both before and after
diagnosis due to the unique characteristics of the cohort, including the full spectrum of familial and genetic risk
and the large proportion of women recruited under 45 years of age (n=12,384 (37%) at enrollment). The BCFR
Cohort is diverse with 26% of families from populations underrepresented in research (6% Asian/Pacific Islander,
6% Black, 8% Hispanic, 5% mixed ethnicity). We have created and maintained comprehensive biospecimen
resources (e.g., cell lines, DNA, plasma, tumor tissue). We have followed individuals who were unaffected
(n=27,753) or affected (n=12,276) with breast cancer at enrollment for up to 26 years (average length of follow-
up = 19.1 and 15.8 years, respectively), and we have prospectively ascertained 1,062 incident breast cancers
and 1,105 second breast cancer events (e.g., recurrences, second primary breast cancer) in the unaffected with
breast cancer and affected with breast cancer at baseline sub-cohorts, respectively. During the past four years,
we have expanded recruitment and enrolled 701 young women under age 45 years. In the next five years we
propose to further enrich the BCFR Cohort using a systematic and coordinated approach across all six BCFR
sites over the next five years by 1) expanding the Cohort through enrollment of 1,090 young women who are
newly diagnosed with breast cancer before age 45 years and at least one first degree relative, increasing the
racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity (78% of young breast cancer families will be from underrepresented
populations); 2) enhancing the value of the full BCFR Cohort by following all participants through efficient data
linkages to environmental exposure and outcome databases (e.g., cancer and death registries); 3) maintaining
and expanding the biospecimen resources, including collection of plasma for cell-free DNA and urine; and 4)
continuing to promote and expand the use of BCFR resources by external investigators and large consortia
around the world. By including several novel components, we aim to answer questions on the role of life course
on accumulation of risk, critical windows of exposure, and the factors underlying the increase in breast cancer
incidence in young women. We will continue to serve as a resource to the international research community with
extensive epidemiologic and molecular data. We remain focused on addressing clinically important research
questions on breast cancer susceptibility, outcomes, survival and survivorship and remain committed to reducing
the breast cancer burden through discovery-based research about breast cancer development and progression."

Aging is a progressive process in all cells that leads to tissue dysfunction and is a major cause of degenerative
changes. Aging cells show characteristic patterns of epigenetic changes that are often cell-type and tissue-
specific. The development of methylation-based clocks has harnessed this phenomenon and is successfully
used to predict the biological age of cells, tissues, and organisms across species. However, the functional
implications of these epigenetic changes are not well understood. Furthermore, bulk analyses of aging cells
limit the identification of subtle, unique, cell-type specific changes. Therefore, investigating cellular aging
mechanisms with single cell resolution is essential for teasing out these cell-type specific changes. Most
blinding diseases are a result of age-related retinal degeneration, for which there are currently no treatments. It
is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate retinal aging to identify targets and develop
therapeutics to slow or prevent the onset of these degenerative diseases. I propose to use approaches that
have previously been applied to studying retinal development and regeneration to conduct a comprehensive
analysis of normal retinal aging with single cell resolution to identify gene regulatory networks that control
cellular aging in the retina. I will determine how acute injury influences the rate of retinal aging, and test
potential retina specific aging targets to slow the aging process. I will manipulate expression of transcription
factors whose activity is altered by natural aging, injury, and/or rejuvenation, and determine whether this can
regulate cellular age. Completion of this work will create accurate cell type-specific molecular aging clocks for
all major retinal cell types, identify gene networks and targets that control cellular aging, and determine if
modulation of these networks can be used to rejuvenate cells. The datasets created in this work will not only
enhance the study of retinal aging, but cellular aging throughout the central nervous system in general."
10770505,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer incidence increases with age in a tissue-specific fashion. Genetic instability and epigenetic alterations
(e.g., cytosine methylation) are hallmarks of both cancer etiology and aging, thus linking aging to cancer.
Importantly, alternative DNA structure-forming sequences (i.e., non-B DNA) have been identified as
endogenous mutation hotspots associated with cancer etiology in an age-related and tissue-specific fashion.
Further, methylation can impact non-B DNA formation, its mutagenic potential, and DNA repair mechanisms;
and the mutagenic processing of non-B DNA requires DNA repair proteins. However, the mechanisms involved
in the age-related and tissue-specific generation of these mutation “hotspots” remain largely unknown. With the
aging population increasing, there is a critical need to fill this fundamental gap in knowledge. Our long-term
goal is to elucidate the mechanisms of age-associated, tissue-specific DNA structure-induced genetic
instability to guide future studies to develop new strategies to prevent and/or treat cancer. Thus, the overall
objective of this application is to determine the mechanisms involved in differential DNA structure-induced
genetic instability with age and tissue type to inform on cancer etiology. We will test the novel hypothesis that
the formation of non-B DNA and their mutagenic processing differ with age in a tissue-specific fashion due to
alterations in DNA repair processing and cytosine methylation. The rationale is that determining the
mechanisms associated with age-related, tissue-specific DNA structure-induced genetic instability will offer a
novel scientific framework whereby new strategies to prevent and/or treat age-associated diseases, such as
cancer, can be developed. The hypothesis will be tested in the following aims: 1) Measure the amount of non-B
DNA formed and its mutagenic potential with age in mouse tissues; 2) determine age- and tissue-associated
alterations in cytosine methylation that alter non-B DNA structure formation and mutagenesis; and 3) identify
the DNA repair-associated mechanisms of mutagenic processing of endogenous mutation hotspots with age in
mice. Novel mutation-reporter mice containing human non-B DNA sequences from cancer-associated mutation
hotspots will be used to determine the effects of age and tissue type on the mutagenic processing of non-B
DNA. This is innovative because it will test the novel hypothesis that DNA structure-induced genetic instability
is altered with age and tissue type in mammals, dependent on age-related modulations in epigenetics and
DNA repair. The expected contribution is the elucidation of the impact of age and tissue type on DNA structure-
induced genetic instability, which is significant because the results will inform on the etiology of various cancer
types with age. This is expected to have a significant positive impact because the results will help achieve our
long-term goal to understand the mechanisms of age-associated, DNA structure-induced genetic instability in
various tissues to guide future studies to develop new strategies to prevent and/or treat cancer."
10758205,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To date, there is a significant knowledge gap surrounding the genetic and neuronal mechanisms that regulate
cognitive resilience to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Without a better understanding of these mechanisms,
developing therapeutics to enhance cognitive longevity in the face of AD will remain limited. Our recently
published work, which utilized human-mouse cross-species analysis, identified the post-synaptic gene Dlgap2
(Discs large associated protein 2) as a potential mediator of age- and AD-related cognitive decline through
changes to dendritic spine morphology, which concurs with other previous work investigating spines as a
mediator of AD-related cognitive resilience. My long-term goal for this work is to determine if Dlgap2 is a
genuine modifier of AD-related cognitive decline, and to build a better understanding of the role of Dlgap2 in
synaptic dysfunction during the progression of AD. The novel approach that I am employing is to modulate
Dlgap2 expression in hippocampal neurons of mice that model AD pathogenesis. Using a newly designed
Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) carrying Dlgap2 with and neuron specific promotor, I will overexpress Dlgap2 in
the CA1 of AD mice. To date this is the first work to investigate the role of Dlgap2 in AD-related cognitive
decline. I hypothesize that increasing expression of Dlgap2 in hippocampal pyramidal neurons will enhance
synaptic and dendritic spine remodeling in CA1 and, ultimately, promote cognitive resilience to causal
mutations in our susceptible AD mouse model. I will test this hypothesis by evaluating the impact of changes in
Dlgap2 expression on cognitive aging on 3 different biological scales. 1) I will measure cognitive outcomes in
the hippocampal-dependent domains of working, short-term and long-term memory of young (6mo) and aged
(14mo) AD mice that overexpress Dlgap2 across both sexes. 2) In the same mice, I will determine if
overexpression of Dlgap2 in CA1 neurons results in an increase in EPSP spike coupling and/or Long-term
potentiation by using ex vivo whole-cell current-clamp recordings. These recordings will inform me if
overexpression of Dlgap2 in AD reinforces synaptic plasticity via modifications to interactions between
NMDAr/AMPAr and the postsynaptic density. 3) To investigate the effect of Dlgap2 on synaptic structure, I will
image dendritic spine morphology, a modifier of AD-related cognitive decline, of CA1 neurons that overexpress
Dlgap2. The work proposed here will help facilitate my training goals to acquire new skills and knowledge
including those pertaining to: new behavioral assays, electrophysiology, fluorescent microscopy, dendritic
spine imaging, and general wet lab skills. Additionally, this proposed work will greatly assist me in refining my
scientific communication skills, project management skills, and furthering my career development."
10815786,"DEVELOPMENT CORE: SUMMARY
The goal of the Development Core is to mentor, retain, and develop the next generation of MPC leaders and to
expand MPC research development services beyond the University of Minnesota. The Core has four aims:
(1) Establish the MPC Population Scholars Program, an intensive grant writing mentorship program for a racially
and disciplinarily diverse cohort of junior scholars at the University of Minnesota and at institutions nationwide.
The MPC Population Scholars Program will scale up MPC’s mentored proposal development services and
provide the experience to researchers at other institutions; the goal is more competitive proposals from a more
diverse group of scholars.
(2) Provide rapid response seed funding for novel research projects on time-sensitive topics. Spark Grants will
quickly fund high-risk, high-reward research projects on emerging problems.
(3) Administer a short-term graduate research assistant (RA) program to assist new and early stage investigators
in launching nascent projects. The short-term RA Program will provide assistance with data collection, analysis,
literature synthesis, or other activities.
(4) Catalyze the creation of interdisciplinary, cross-university population dynamics research teams with
Population Dynamics Barn-raisings (PDBs). These half-day panel discussion and networking events are
designed to facilitate the creation of synergistic, organic interdisciplinary research teams in MPC’s PRAs.
The Aims of the Development Core, as well as its new and continuing activities and programs, are directly
relevant to the Overall application’s Aims to (1) enhance and expand MPC’s vibrant intellectual environment; (2)
provide end-to-end support for population dynamics research projects; and (3) invest heavily in the next
generation of population dynamics researchers. The Development Core prioritizes new and early stage
investigators for all services and will extend the reach of all current and proposed programming via accessible
livestreams and recordings as well as greater sharing of resources online. These activities—along with more
traditional Development Core activities like weekly MPC Seminars and seed grants—will lead to innovative new
population dynamics research collaborations and projects at MPC and across the nation."
10815790,"SCIENTIFIC/TECHNICAL CORE: SUMMARY
The goal of the Scientific/Technical Core is to maximize the efficiency of funding for population dynamics
research and to increase the scientific impact and productivity of that research at MPC. The Core provides
expertise to investigators designing new research projects, coordinates technical support of ongoing projects,
and helps investigators master advanced methods and technologies. Its service areas include:
(1) Computing and Software Development. The Core provides support for MPC’s high-performance computing
environment; software services; and tools to support data dissemination.
(2) Spatial Analysis. The Core provides spatial analysis services; acquires and processes data from various
spatial data sources; and supports spatial data visualization.
(3) Data Science. Core services include assessing the feasibility of proposed new data infrastructure projects;
developing record linkage and machine learning tools; and innovating in data capture techniques.
(4) Data Access and Preservation. Core services include locating and acquiring data; providing secure facilities
for access to restricted data; and developing data archive plans to facilitate replication and preservation.
The Scientific/Technical Core provides members with shared resources that could not be efficiently supported
by any single project. This model of centralized technical services increases the impact and pace of population
dynamics research conducted at MPC in three ways: (1) It maximizes the fit between technical expertise and
project needs; (2) It maintains a pool of talented software developers, GIS experts, data scientists, and others
with technical expertise and experience working with population science data; and (3) It minimizes startup time
and costs for new and developmental projects.
For all Core services, MPC prioritizes the needs of new and early stage investigators. In the next period of P2C
support, the Scientific/Technical Core will also work to enhance access to its services and resources by members
of the population dynamics research community who work in institutions without P2C support."
10818341,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pre-clinical Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a period in which systemic autoimmunity develops in the years prior to
onset of clinically apparent disease. Here, we aim to define the mechanisms leading to pre-clinical autoimmunity,
which could inform the design of therapies to block these pathways and prevent RA. Our group has been integral
in identifying and investigating the “mucosal origins” hypothesis of RA, utilizing the collagen-induced arthritis
(CIA) model to demonstrate the requirement of the microbiome for disease development. We recently identified
a bacterial-derived tryptophan metabolite, indole, as a key regulator of autoimmunity in this model. Depletion of
either the microbiome (using broad-spectrum antibiotics) or dietary tryptophan is protective against CIA, and
supplementation with indole in either setting reverses this protection. This indole-CIA model provides, for the first
time, a model in which a single bacterial metabolite is sufficient for disease development. Based on our
preliminary findings that Th17 cells and inflammatory cytokine production (especially IL-6) are elevated in this
indole-CIA model, I hypothesize that indole is a bioactive metabolite that promotes CIA by skewing Th17 cell
differentiation and stimulating antigen presenting cells (APCs) to produce IL-6. The experiments outlined in this
proposal are designed to define the effects of indole on CIA. Aim 1 will determine the effect of indole on CD4
effector T cell responses, both in the indole-CIA model and in a model of antigen-specific T cell responses
utilizing OT-II transgenic mice. Aim 2 will then identify the source of and requirement for indole-mediated IL-6
production. I will utilize combined single cell RNA/ATACseq to identify the cell subsets and signaling pathways
in which indole induces IL-6 production. Finally, I will test the requirement for dendritic cell (DC)-mediated IL-6
production in indole-CIA. Successful completion of these aims will (1) define the cell subsets and functions
affected by indole in the indole-CIA model, which will allow for future mechanistic studies to better define and
modulate this process, (2) define the role of DC-derived IL-6 in CIA, which has never been shown, and (3)
generate hypotheses to later identify the signaling pathways affected by indole stimulation, which will be
necessary to understand the mechanisms by which indole incites autoimmunity. Altogether, these findings will
fill a critical knowledge gap regarding the role of the microbiome in the development of inflammatory arthritis.
Furthermore, through these studies I will become an expert in mucosal immunology, learn to design and test
rigorous hypotheses, and become proficient in cutting-edge bioinformatic techniques through analysis of the
RNA/ATACseq data generated in Aim 2. The training gained through this proposal will enable me to be well-
positioned for a research fellowship in rheumatology and apply skills needed for a successful K08 in the future."

10862698,"SUMMARY
The goal of this training grant proposal is to prepare predoctoral trainees for productive research
careers in the field of signaling and cellular regulation. The training faculty mentors consist of an
outstanding, internationally recognized group of researchers in the Department of Biochemistry
and the Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology, who, by using the
highest standards of scientific rigor and reproducibility, have make major breakthroughs towards
the discovery and characterization of new mechanisms for biological cell signaling and
regulation. The program will mentor students to gain critical thinking skills and depth in
understanding how to assimilate different scientific areas to solve problems in modern molecular
biosciences, and teach them how to use apply these skills when they enter the biomedical
research workforce. Program elements will include program-specific elective courses, an annual
Symposium, Supergroup research conferences, seminars, and journal clubs, together with
trainee monitoring through thesis committees and organizational meetings. These approaches
will expose students to broad, interdisciplinary scientific areas through cross-disciplinary
mentorship, collaboration, and team building; provide them with rigorous training in experimental
design, classical and modern technologies, and data analysis, with high standards for
reproducibility; foster a proactive community effort to promote the recruitment and retention of
underrepresented trainees; and support students’ progress and ability to work in teams in an
inclusive environment through all aspects of their training. Coursework on responsible conduct
of research will instill students with an awareness of norms and expectations for conducting
research with high ethical standards. Professional development and career training workshops
will expose students to diverse career trajectories and opportunities, with experiential coaching
for planning and landing employment. By integrating SCR Program-specific coursework and
activities with departmental graduate program requirements, and through mindful and
responsive mentoring, we will create a thriving collaborative, inclusive, and interdisciplinary
graduate training environment."
10851024,"Platelets play a crucial role in hemostasis and thrombosis, and more and more studies indicate their
role in other disease states including inflammation, cancer, and atherosclerosis Platelets express a
number of surface receptors, which through their activation, allow platelets to interpret their local
environment and to detect vascular lesions and promote hemostasis. My group focuses on these
signaling steps and how their interplay mediates platelet activation. Understanding signaling networks
and their regulation has been my research focus for the past two decades and our group has made
important contributions to the platelet-signaling field. My research goals are to identify novel signaling
molecules that regulate main signaling pathways, characterize novel signaling pathways emanating
from the same signaling molecule, and understand the differences in various tyrosine kinase
pathways in platelets. My additional goals are to understand what changes occur in platelet
composition, including miRNAs, with age and disease, such as diabetes, that make them more
susceptible to thrombotic events. This work builds on our past contributions in the field and a host of
reagents and genetic tools that we have amassed. In this proposal, we place particular emphasis on
the intracellular interactions that regulate a signaling molecule. One of the novelties of the studies
proposed is that the same protein kinase, through differential tyrosine phosphorylation, activates
diverse signaling pathways, which have distinct roles in hemostasis. The studies proposed in this
application will provide further insights into the regulation and identification of novel signaling
pathways in platelets, which may be applicable to other cell systems expressing similar receptors and
could form the basis for novel therapeutic targets to treat thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. In
addition, understanding these signaling cascades in platelets will help us evaluate and predict
possible implications of the therapeutic agents that could interfere with these pathways. For example,
our studies anticipate that Ibrutinib, a Tec kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, will block the CLEC2 pathway in platelets and cause blood flow into lymphatic
vessels. I would like to pursue these goals in the next decade with the same vigor and intensity that
have employed in the past two decades. have been funded by NIH for about 22 years on the platelet
signaling paradigms and have published over 180 papers (on an average of 8 papers a year). The
OIA will alleviate the need to submit separate thematic grant applications to various agencies with
coherent specific aims and will allow us to make significant contributions to the understanding of
platelet signaling networks. Our overarching goal is to understand how the network of receptor-
mediated signaling can be manipulated to control platelet function."
10834287,"Project Summary/Abstract
 It has recently become clear that carcinogenesis and cancer progression involves dysregulation of immune
cells within the tumor microenvironment. The particular interest of this proposal are how tumor cells develop
tactics to manipulate immune cells to facilitate cancer progression, and how chronic inflammation induced
immunosuppression accelerates carcinogenesis. Dr. Wettersten recently published that tumor cell expression of
a cell adhesion receptor, integrin αvβ3, is associated with the enrichment of tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs), which are known to promote immune suppression and prevent the influx of cytotoxic T cells. Her new
preliminary studies reveal that αvβ3 expression on lung cancer cells is sufficient to recruit TAMs and that
inflammatory mediators can induce αvβ3 expression both on normal lung epithelium as well as lung cancer cells.
Together, these findings suggest inflammation can induce tumor cell expression of αvβ3, which in turn leads to
TAM accumulation, immune suppression, and tumor progression. Furthermore, inflammation induced αvβ3
expression on lung epithelium may contribute to the well-known relationship between inflammation and cancer.
 The overall goals of this study are to understand how αvβ3+ cancer cells promote a pro-
tumor/immunosuppressive microenvironment during cancer progression and how αvβ3 expression on normal
lung epithelium induces inflammation-mediated carcinogenesis. Aim 1 will determine if TAM enrichment factors
from αvβ3+ cancer cells promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The goal of Aim 2 is to target
integrin αvβ3+ cancer cells to shift the tumor immune profile from pro-tumor to anti-tumor. Aim 3 will assess if
inflammation-induced expression of integrin αvβ3 on lung epithelial cells accelerates carcinogenesis. To achieve
these aims, the expression of αvβ3 will be genetically modified in immunocompetent mouse models of lung
cancer and inflammation to reveal how αvβ3+ cells exploit the immune system to enable cancer development
and progression. Understanding this process will lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to
strengthen the anti-tumor immune response.
 Dr. Wettersten’s career goal is to become an independent investigator in an academic setting. She will leverage
her dual training as a veterinarian and cancer biologist to generate new therapeutic approaches targeting the
communication between the tumor microenvironment and cancer cells. While her project is strongly supported
by her recent findings with Dr. Cheresh, exploring the impact of αvβ3+ cancer cells in the tumor
microenvironment is distinct from Dr. Cheresh’s existing work, and the novel mouse models established in this
study will provide a foundation for her to further investigate the cancer cell-microenvironment interaction. Dr.
Cheresh and her other collaborators at UCSD will give her access to world-class facilities, equipment, and animal
models, providing her with an ideal environment to accomplish the proposed work and launch her career as an
independent investigator."
10833600,"Project Summary
Treatment advances in psychosis may be limited by the use of phenomenology-defined diagnoses based on
symptomatic outcomes, rather than by neurobiological constructs monitored by quantitative characteristics. The
Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) uses biomarkers to define psychosis
subgroups with the goal of testing the advantages of B-SNIP biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions,
consistent with principles in the NIMH Strategic Plan (NSP). With >3000 phenotyped psychosis probands,
relatives and healthy controls, B-SNIP has a multilevel biomarker library for psychosis and used that library to
re-conceptualize psychosis subgroups as biomarker-defined Biotypes (B1, B2, B3), where B1 and B2 are the
low cognition/high symptom groups and B3 shows lower symptoms and relatively normal cognition. We
replicated Biotypes in a new sample, “forging a future where measures of an individual’s … neural and
physiological state will form the basis of an increasingly specific and informative diagnosis” (NSP). In this grant
we propose that B1, with its low cognition and low cortical activity, will respond uniquely to clozapine, a drug
which will generate active cortical attractor networks in B1 to support symptomatic improvement.
Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic drug (APD) with unique clinical efficacy. It is the least used APD
because its side effects are serious (neutropenia, myocarditis, seizures) and its administration complex. A
predictive biomarker would allow targeting of cases most likely to respond and improve prognosis in psychosis.
B-SNIP has shown that clozapine is associated with increases in EEG measures of alpha/theta power, and we
identify this increase in time periods without stimulus processing requirements as intrinsic EEG activity (IEA),
across all Biotypes. Because B1 cases express low IEA, clozapine’s action to increase EEG power will be
normalizing for this psychosis subgroup, with increased cortical attractor states. Because B2 express
accentuated IEA, clozapine is associated with more deviant IEA in B2. We propose to test B1 psychosis cases
with clozapine vs. risperidone (n=40/group clinical trial completers), over a 6 week cross-titration (to therapeutic
plasma levels) and a 9 week stable dose extension, predicting that the B1/clozapine group will respond
significantly better, as measured with total PANSS, than the B1/risperidone group and also better than either B2
group. It is our hypothesis that the cortical attractor networks will be normalized and their function increased by
the increase in intrinsic EEG activity."
10837790,"Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated
protein tau (tau), are by far the most correlated pathology for clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD).
Emerging evidence suggests that extracellular vesicles (EVs, such as exosomes and microvesicles), transfer
pathological tau between cells as vehicles, propagating tau pathology. It is urgently important to find the
molecular basis of brain-derived EVs, which may critically regulate EV uptake by neurons and aggregation of
tau protein in EVs and/or recipient neurons. We have recently established the method for isolating EVs from
human brain samples and successfully performed their proteomic profiling. We found that selective molecules
from the EV proteomics datasets were able to differentiate human AD-EV from healthy control (CTRL)-EV with
88% accuracy by machine learning analysis, confirming pathogenic character of AD-EV molecules.
Furthermore, our exciting preliminary data have shown that AD-EV have significantly higher tau seeding
activity compared to CTRL-EV by FRET sensor tau seeding assay with subsets of EV molecules showing
significant association with tau seeding activity. This proposed project will fortify these preliminary results and
find the converging or specific mechanisms among tauopathies for mediating tau aggregation and its seeding
via EV uptake through proteomics and biological examination of brain-derived EV samples. To meet this
challenge, we assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have a strong record of
accomplishments in biologic (Ikezu), proteomic (Emili) and bioengineering and bioinformatic analysis (Issador).
In Aim1, we will examine EV samples from 240 new brain specimens (40 AD, 40 CTE, 40 LBD, 40 PSP, 40
CBD and 40 CTRL) for precision mass-spectrometry-based proteomics and tau-interactomes, and analyze
those datasets by the machine learning approach. Aim 2 will examine the efficiency of tau propagation using
tau fibrils, oligomers and EVs isolated from the same donors of the 5 different tauopathies and control cases in
vitro and in vivo using FRET-based tau seeding assay and EV uptake by primary cultured mouse cortical
neurons in vitro. EV-associated tau will be further characterized by the biochemical and microscopy-based
analysis for their conformational and posttranslational changes. We will evaluate the difference in tau
propagation after the intracranial injection of the tau seeds from different tauopathy brains using our recently
established mouse models. Aim3 will identify candidate molecules most likely involved in EV uptake and tau
seeding activity by bioinformatic analysis of the proteome dataset (Aim 1) and biological datasets (Aim 2). We
will then test the functional roles of the identified molecules on EV uptake, tau seeding activities and neuronal
firing activities in vitro. The candidate molecules will be specifically targeted by gene silencing or antagonists
for their therapeutic potential to halt tau propagation in vitro and in vivo. Successful identification of responsible
molecules for tau propagation will serve as a foundation for understanding EV-mediated disease progression."
10837056,"ABSTRACT
Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against
macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened
against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human
proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific
probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical
probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we
propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against
any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental
crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein
will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with
high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then
optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The
proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for
ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel
fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii)
Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.
 More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for
which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra-
large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined
pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo
design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization.
Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select
consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and
bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will
progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.
 Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical
probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert
crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental
validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the
druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies"
10817885,"Large-scale treatment programs with praziquantel (PZQ) monotherapy are the mainstay of efforts to control
and eliminate schistosomiasis. The potential for drug resistance in schistosomes is a critical area of
research as we scale up treatment coverage. In the laboratory, PZQ resistance (PZQ-R) is easily selected,
results in a >368-fold difference in drug response, and genetic analyses unambiguously identify a region of
chr. 3 containing a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel. In Western Kenya, approximately 30% of
schistosome-infected patients are egg-positive following treatment with PZQ, and in a recent study
(SCORE) we observed several “hotspot” villages that failed to lower infection intensities and prevalence,
despite multiple annual mass treatments with PZQ. One hypothesis is that PZQ-R contributes to the
observed failure of mass PZQ treatment to lower infection. In aim 1 we will ask whether the persistence
of infection in “hotspot” villages can be explained by resistance. We have established a novel
platform for testing for the extent of PZQ-R in individual adult schistosomes from a field setting. To do this
we have established a large snail breeding colony, and hamster breeding facility. We can therefore
generate large populations of field-derived adult worms, by (i) harvesting S. mansoni eggs from infected
patients, (ii) infecting snails with miracidia, (iii) infecting hamsters with released cercariae, and (iv) perfusing
adult worms from hamsters. We will screen the drug response of individual S. mansoni worms maintained
on 96-well plates and exposed to PZQ using a simple L-Lactate assay. Using this approach, we will directly
compare resistance status of parasites from hotspot and non-hotspot villages. We will also compare pools
of PZQ-R and PZQ-S parasites isolated from the field to determine the genome regions that underlie the
differences observed, and to test the hypothesis that genetic variation in the TRP channel on chr. 3
underlies PZQ resistance in the field. In aim 2 we will exploit our unique platform to examine genetic
variation for resistance to new schistosome drugs. A suite of compounds showing strong activity
against schistosomes is now available. Recent field studies have shown high levels of naturally occurring
resistance to oxamniquine in East Africa where this drug has been minimally used, and comparable work
with the free-living nematode C. elegans shows naturally occurring resistance to a range of anthelmintic
compounds. We will critically test the hypothesis that “standing variation” for resistance is common against
schistosome drugs under development. We will then compare individual worms at the extremes of the drug
response spectrum to identify the genetic basis of resistance. The knowledge gained will be critical to on-
going schistosomiasis elimination efforts through mass PZQ treatment and will provide valuable information
for the development of new anti-schistosome drugs. The project will also stimulate development of research
capacity in genome sequencing, computational biology and anthelminthic pharmacology in Kenya."

The postdoctoral Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes Training Program at the University of Michigan is
designed to recruit and provide high quality research training in one of two major tracks, Basic Science or
Clinical Investigation & Epidemiology to qualified candidates. Now on its 15th year, the theme of the Program is
developmental programming of disorders of glucose metabolism. The program is organized to complement the
established training program in clinical pediatric endocrinology for M.D.s, and for basic scientists pursuing a
career in endocrine related research, by providing 2 years of intensive postdoctoral training using a closely-
mentored research training program individually structured for each trainee. The program is actively supported
by 14 faculty from 11 UM Departments/Schools, all with extensive research and mentoring experience within
their respective areas of expertise. The Program also includes an extensive didactic component tailored to
each trainee’s educational background and research interests. Trainees initiating Basic Science research
complete a 3-month course designed to expose them to a variety of state-of-the-art techniques, as well as to
skills in performing hypothesis-driven, controlled research studies. Trainees in Clinical Investigation &
Epidemiology choose between Outcomes & Epidemiology or Clinical Research. They complete courses
leading to either a Master of Public Health in Biostatistics & Epidemiology or a Master of Science in Clinical
Research Design & Statistical Analysis. In addition to the formal curriculum, trainees attend weekly clinical and
research seminars, receive instruction preparing and delivering oral presentations, and instruction in ethical
conduct of research. Mentored research is supported the Medical School resources including the Centers of
Comprehensive Diabetes Research, Nutrition Obesity Research, Organogenesis, Human Growth and
Development, Comprehensive Metabolomic Center, Molecular & Behavioral Neuroscience Institute and the
Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. To optimize each trainee’s potential for development of a
successful academic career, trainees are required to submit abstracts to national meetings, submit a first-
authored research manuscript, and apply for individual grant funding. Expansion of our Program will help
alleviate the critical shortage of successful Pediatric Endocrinologists and Pediatric Physician-Scientists."

The purpose of the Child Health Research Career Development Award (CHRCDA) Program at the Children’s
National Hospital (CNH) is to facilitate the development of successful basic, translational, and clinical research
careers for junior faculty members in pediatrics across the T0-T4 spectrum. The rationale for the program is
that while many opportunities exist to use molecular biology, biomedical engineering, and translational science
to advance treatment of pediatric diseases, the comprehensive scientific knowledge and practical experience
that are required to capitalize on these opportunities are often deficient among young pediatrician-investigators
who have recently finished extended periods of clinical training. The CHRCDA at CNH addresses this need by
providing sufficient protected time for nascent scientists during their initial academic appointment. In our
program, scholars will: 1) take coursework in basic, translational, or clinical science areas relevant to their
research; 2) learn state-of-the art laboratory and computational methodologies; 3) develop preliminary data
under the supervision of established and committed mentors that will lead to submission of independent NIH
grant applications; and 4) learn to effectively advance accomplishments in basic, translational, and clinical
research into improvements in child health. In order to accomplish these goals, the CHRCDA scholars will
spend at least 75% effort honing these skills under the mentorship of established investigators/mentors over a
2-4 year period (depending on past experience and area of investigation). During this period, each of the
above tasks will be addressed in a systematic fashion, including participation in a core curriculum in research
methodology and biostatistics, in training in responsible conduct of research, and in performance of
increasingly independent research under supervising senior investigators. We will fund three scholars annually
at the Assistant Professor level with a specific goal of enhancing scholar diversity through aggressive outreach
and recruitment. We will have 21 senior mentors in four scientific affinity groups: neuroscience, molecular
genetics, cancer and immunology, and biomedical engineering. The administrative structure will include two

10805516,"Apolipoprotein-B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins are both a biomarker and a causal mediator of many central hallmarks of metabolic disease, including insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a heterodimeric complex of MTP and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) subunits, profoundly reduces specifically atherogenic apoB- containing lipoproteins by 50%, but it causes hepatosteatosis and steatorrhea of the intestine. MTP complex transfers different lipids and assists in the production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. Our recent work provides the first evidence that the triglyceride (TG) and phospholipid (PL) transfer functions of MTP can be decoupled and that inhibition of TG transfer activity in zebrafish does not result in steatosis and these fish grow normally like wild-type fish. We hypothesize that atomic level details about these two lipid transfer domains may pave the way for selective pharmacological inhibition of TG transfer to lower plasma lipids without causing the adverse effects of cellular lipid retention. The fundamental question we are asking is: “how MTP distinguishes different lipid ligands and what are the consequences of inhibiting TG transfer activity?” Aim 1: Characterize the different lipid-binding sites in MTP: We will solve MTP structures with different lipid ligands to obtain atomic level details. Mutational analysis will elucidate amino acid residues critical for binding of specific lipids. Aim 2: Identify conformational changes in MTP and PDI subunits during lipid transfer, and different PDI family members that interact with MTP subunit: We hypothesize that conformational changes in both the MTP and PDI subunits occur to accommodate different lipids. We will perform site-directed mutagenesis in the flexible loop region of MTP and a’ domain of PDI to dissect out the mechanisms for this. Although PDI is obligatory for MTP activity, the specificity of different PDI paralogs is unknown. We will test the hypothesis that other PDI family members interact with the MTP subunit and these interactions have physiological consequences. Aim 3: Assess the biological consequences of abolishing TG transfer activity of MTP: After identifying further mutations that abolish TG transfer, we will determine whether these mutants support apoB secretion in cells, lower plasma lipids in mice, and sustain normal fish growth. The proposed studies will provide novel information about 1) the domains and amino acids in the transfer of different lipids by MTP; 2) conformational changes that occur during transfer of different lipids; and 3) biochemical, physiological and organismal consequences of mutating these critical residues. This new knowledge will be invaluable, in the future, to develop novel and TG transfer specific inhibitors of MTP."

Treatment advances in psychosis are limited by the use of phenomenology-defined diagnoses based on
symptomatic outcomes, rather than by neurobiological constructs monitored by quantitative characteristics.
The Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) uses biomarkers to define
psychosis subgroups with the goal of testing the advantages of B-SNIP biomarkers for diagnostic and
therapeutic decisions, consistent with principles in the NIMH Strategic Plan (NSP). With >3000 phenotyped
psychosis probands, relatives and healthy controls (HC), B-SNIP has a multilevel biomarker library for
psychosis and used that library to re-conceptualize psychosis subgroups as biomarker-defined Biotypes (B1,
B2, B3), where B1 and B2 are the low cognition/high symptom groups and B3 shows lower symptoms and
relatively normal cognition. We replicated Biotypes in a new sample, “forging a future where measures of an
individual's … neural and physiological state will form the basis of an increasingly specific and informative
diagnosis” (NSP). In this grant we propose that B1, with its low cognition and low cortical activity, will respond
uniquely to clozapine, a drug which will generate active cortical attractor networks in B1 to support
symptomatic improvement.
Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic drug (APD) with unique clinical efficacy. It is the least used APD
because its side effects are serious (neutropenia, myocarditis, seizures) and its administration complex. A
predictive biomarker would allow targeting of cases most likely to respond and improve prognosis in psychosis.
B-SNIP has shown that clozapine is associated with increases in EEG measures of alpha/theta power, and we
identify this increase in time periods without stimulus processing requirements as intrinsic EEG activity (IEA),
across all Biotypes. Because B1 cases express low IEA, clozapine's action to increase EEG power will be
normalizing for this psychosis subgroup, with increased cortical attractor states. Because B2 express
accentuated IEA, clozapine is associated with more deviant IEA in B2. We propose to test B1 psychosis cases
with clozapine vs. risperidone (n=40/group clinical trial completers), over a 6 week cross-titration (to
therapeutic plasma levels) and a 9 week stable dose extension, predicting that the B1/clozapine group will
respond significantly better, as measured with total PANSS, than the B1/risperidone group and also better than
either B2 group. It is our hypothesis that the cortical attractor networks will be normalized and their function
increased by the increase in intrinsic EEG activity."
10834912,"Psychiatric hospitalization is a critical opportunity to provide treatment to reduce the risk of suicide and
lay the groundwork for functional recovery. In fact, the period following psychiatric hospitalization presents the
greatest risk of death by suicide for Veterans. Despite psychiatric hospitalization being a vital time for
intervention, there are no suicide-specific evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) that can be feasibly delivered
during a typical VHA inpatient stay. Importantly, suicide-specific inpatient interventions are primarily focused
on reducing the reoccurrence of suicidal behavior and have limited or no focus on directly targeting other aspects
of functional recovery. Preventing suicide during a crisis is only a short-term solution if we fail to assist patients
in building a life they deem worth living.
 Our research over the past several years has been focused on addressing this gap and overcoming barriers
to implementing psychosocial interventions in an inpatient setting. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
is a psychosocial intervention well suited to both preventing suicide and enhancing functioning, but we were not
aware of any ACT-based treatment protocols designed to specifically target suicide risk. We consulted with
leading ACT clinicians and researchers to develop and manualize “ACT for Life”, a brief, transdiagnostic,
recovery-oriented, inpatient, intervention for Veterans hospitalized due to suicide risk. The individual
intervention involves 3 to 6 inpatient sessions and 1 to 4 outpatient sessions focused on skills generalization and
treatment engagement. We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study evaluating the acceptability of ACT
for Life and the feasibility of the planned design for the proposed randomized controlled efficacy trial. Results of
this rigorous pilot study support the acceptability and feasibility of ACT for Life. Nearly all Veterans reported
that they believed they benefitted from ACT for Life. Preliminary outcomes suggest that ACT for Life may
improve functioning and reduce suicidal behavior following hospitalization due to suicide risk. However, a full-
scale clinical trial will be necessary to definitively evaluate the efficacy of ACT for Life.
 To accomplish this goal, we are proposing to conduct a randomized controlled trial of ACT for Life versus
Present Centered Therapy in 278 Veterans hospitalized for suicide risk to examine outcomes of suicidal behavior
and changes in functioning over a one-year period following psychiatric hospitalization. The specific aims of this
study are to determine the efficacy of ACT for Life for preventing suicidal behavior and maximizing functional
recovery, and to examine candidate ACT for Life treatment mechanisms. Participants will complete assessments
prior to treatment, before discharge from the inpatient unit, and at one-, three-, six-, and twelve-months
following discharge. The proposed randomized controlled trial of ACT for Life has the potential to fill the VHA’s
need for empirically-supported inpatient interventions that can be delivered during a typical inpatient stay, are
recovery oriented, and prevent future suicidal behavior. If results support the efficacy of the ACT for Life
intervention, ACT for Life will be the first and only inpatient, evidence-based psychotherapy known to prevent
suicidal behavior among Veterans."
10818434,"Up to 60 chemical elements can be detected in the human body, about 25 of which are essential to life. Elements such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and selenium (Se) are constituents of enzyme cofactors required for a wide range of processes from cell cycle regulation, reproduction, structural repair, and immunity. Dysregulation of these elements is a hallmark of disease. For instance, aluminum (Al), Fe, Cu and Zn accumulation in amyloid plaques in the brain are associated with Alzheimer’s disease and dysregulation of Cu causes Menkes and Wilson’s disease. Chemical elements are also diagnostic tools and chemotherapeutics; gadolinium (Gd) is the most common magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, metal-base nanoparticles show promise for targeted drug delivery and platinum (Pt) and arsenic (As) compounds are used in cancer treatment. Invariably, knowing the spatial distribution of an element in an organ, tissue or cell is essential to fully investigate mechanisms of disease or the efficacy of drug delivery. Hence, elemental imaging at the micron scale is essential to further the NIGMS goal to support basic research that increases our understanding of biological processes and lays the foundation for advances in disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Current analytical resources for biomedical elemental imaging are either over-subscribed (synchrotron X-ray fluorescence), cover only a limited range of elements, are performed under a vacuum or not readily scalable to imaging at the mm scale. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a laboratory-based elemental imaging (elemental imaging) technique that it is increasingly being applied to biomedical applications with comparable or lower detection limits than other elemental imaging techniques and, potentially, easier access and operability. To date there are no elemental imaging LA-ICP-MS user resources in the US. The Dartmouth Trace Element Analysis Core is an established and highly regarded shared resource that supports researchers throughout the US, is staffed by experienced researchers in elemental imaging and ICP-MS, uses state-of-the-art instrumentation and has excellent links to industry partners. Our aims are to expand upon our current ad hoc elemental imaging service to establish an elemental imaging user facility; the Biomedical National Elemental Imaging Resource (BNEIR), which will accelerate and simplify access for biomedical researchers to instrumentation, expertise, web-based and in-person training, after-visit support, software and will foster a dynamic community for elemental imaging users. We will actively promote the elemental imaging within the larger NIGMS community of scientists through webinars, seminars, attendance at national and international meetings and actively seeking out NIH researchers currently pursuing relevant research projects."

ALACRITY for Early Screening and Treatment of High Risk Youth (eSToRY)
R34 Prevention and Early Identification for High Risk Youth in School-based Clinics
The proposed project aims to implement and test tools necessary to prevent transitions to mental illness
among at-risk youth, and particularly at-risk racial/ethnic and language (REL)-minority youth. Risk factors for
REL-minority youth can be heightened due to their greater likelihood of experiencing discrimination and
socioeconomic barriers and their subsequent impacts on access and engagement in treatment and overall
wellness. The overall aim of this project is to prevent and remediate a surge in youth mental illness and to
reduce persistent treatment disparities. First, we propose to use a remote adaptive testing technology, “K-
CAT+”, to provide rapid community-based screening. Second, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a targeted,
online health promotion intervention, COPE2THRIVE (C2T), to build resilience in a REL-diverse sample of
school-aged youth. Third, we will assess whether this approach mitigates increased risk faced by racial/ethnic
and language (REL)-minority youth.
In Aim 1, we test the feasibility and acceptability of a parent- and youth-reported electronic mental health
screener, K-CAT, among 12-17 year old youth in a school-based setting. The adaptive screening platform, K-
CAT, reduces the time and total number of measures that are required. We supplement K-CAT (to make “K-
CAT+”) with measures of functional status, complex trauma, and individual- and neighborhood-level social
determinants of health (SDOH). In Aim 2, we test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of
the COPE2THRIVE (C2T) intervention, a resilience intervention targeting the mechanism of coping self-
efficacy to reduce symptoms and improve function. We select youth determined by the K-CAT+ to be at
moderate risk for mental illness. In Aim 3, we assess whether the combination of early school-based screening
and the preventive C2T intervention reduces disparities in engagement in treatment, and reduces symptoms
and improves function for REL-minorities.
The screening and preventive interventions tested in this project have the potential to reduce persistent REL
disparities in access and engagement in treatment and mental health outcomes, by enhancing the availability
and ease of screening, overcoming known biases in recognition and referral, and by intervening earlier than
usual among at-risk REL-minority youth."

The overall goal of the Administrative Core is to ensure timely and effective execution of proposed work
through management, coordination and supervision of the Project and Core Leaders and research personnel
and resolution of any conflicts that may arise. The Administrative Core will ensure that the interaction of the
Projects and Core B are optimized so as to succeed in the following goals: identification of new gene functions,
drug targets and metabolic responses in Mtb, correlation of these with the transmission phenotype of clinical
isolates, development of new tests for a TB treatment's transmission-blocking potential, new animal models for
aerogenic transmission of TB that allow experimental modification of the genetics of Mtb and the
characteristics of aerosolized droplets, and consideration of new approaches to reduce R0."
10832589,"Shared Resource Core B – Abstract
This integrated P01 program relies on the premise that the biophysics of respiratory droplets impacts M.
tuberculosis (Mtb) payload, physiology and culturability, and thus influences its ability to transmit and infect a
new host. To study the aerobiology of infection and identify the bacterial genes required for effective
transmission, we will develop a tractable model of simulated Mtb transmission and apply it to compare infectivity
of wild type versus mutant Mtb strains, from cavity caseum to terminal lung airways. The mouse is the most
widespread animal model of aerosol infection used to investigate TB disease, bacterial genetic requirements
and response to therapy. There is extensive experimental evidence supporting efficient lung ‘seeding’ by
aerosolized Mtb droplets. Our group has access to two large animal BSL3 facilities and has a long-standing
expertise in developing and optimizing new animal models to address challenging questions that require
translational tools.
We have also developed tools to generate cavity caseum in a modified rabbit model of active TB, and variations
of caseum surrogate that rely on foamy macrophage lysate and mucosalivary secretion mimics as the starting
point. These matrices will be optimized and used (i) in in vitro screens of Mtb mutants to identify and validate
candidate genes required for survival of Mtb during the transitions between host-like and environmental
conditions (with Projects 1 and 2: identification of genes and adaptive metabolic responses that Mtb requires to
survive transmission stresses), (ii) as the starting material to aerosolize Mtb bacilli in experiments of controlled
transmission to mice, to qualitatively and quantitively mimic overall features of human respiratory secretion
dynamics in the bioaerosol generator, and (iii) to test the hypothesis that some drugs may impair transmission
despite accumulating in caseum and cavities at concentrations that are sub-bactericidal.
With support and guidance from the Aerobiology Project 4, we will combine and leverage in vitro, ex vivo and in
vivo tools to develop and optimize a mouse model of simulated transmission by controlled aerosol infection. The
model will be applied to confirm the contribution of Mtb genes and pathways – identified in vitro – in the successful
multi-step transition from one host to another. Mutants with demonstrated loss of fitness for transmission in mice
will progress to testing between-animal transmission in guinea pigs (Project 3: Mechanisms of cough in M.
tuberculosis transmission).
Thus Core B activities serve the objectives of each project and will be closely guided by Aerobiology Project 4."
10832593,"Abstract
The goal of this project is to identify gene products whose inhibition could offer fresh approaches to reducing to
<1 the number of cases generated by the average infected person with tuberculosis (TB) in an uninfected
population: the R0. Specifically, using physiologically relevant fluids and environmental conditions, the goal is to
conduct a genome-wide survey for genes that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) requires to survive the following
transitions it encounters in the course of transmission from one host to another: from a necrotic pulmonary lesion
to a cavity connected to an airway; from there to expelled micro-droplets that undergo dessication; and from
there to rehydration in the pulmonary alveoli of a new host. Inducible CRISPRi libraries of Mtb will be subjected
to each of these transitions to identify the genes on which Mtb depends to survive them. Collaboration with the
other Projects and Cores in this Program Project will allow us to prioritize individual mutant strains, subject them
to realistically-modeled mechanical aerosolization to test their ability to infect mice, and determine if guinea pigs
infected with them can transmit disease aerogenically. In parallel, TB drugs and tool compounds will be tested
for their impact on Mtb undergoing these transmission-related stresses."
10832601,"Project Summary/Abstract 
The success of any bacterial pathogen ultimately depends on its ability to multiply and transmit to new hosts. 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the human disease tuberculosis and one of the most 
successful pathogens in human history, likely also employs sophisticated means to spread from one person to 
the next, including mediating caseation, tissue destruction, and airborne transmission. Yet, despite the toll Mtb 
has taken on world health, the molecular mechanisms responsible for Mtb transmission remain elusive. A 
major symptom of active tuberculosis is cough, and cough is a major mechanism of transmission. Although 
cough is a major route of aerosolization and transmission of Mtb, very little is known about the factors that 
produce cough during infection. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that Mtb strains 
representing specific lineages are more prevalent in humans but whether differences in prevalence are due to 
differences in bacterial transmissibility and associated factors such as cough induction and aerosolization of 
bacteria is unknown. Thus, there is an urgent need to better characterize the transmission dynamics of Mtb 
and the relationship of cough to transmission. Because nociceptive neurons mediate cough, and some bacteria 
including mycobacteria secrete complex molecules targeting neurons, we hypothesized that Mtb produces 
molecules to trigger nociceptive neurons to activate the cough response, thereby facilitating transmission. We 
discovered and characterized the activity of one such molecule, sulfolipid-1, and recently identified a second 
molecule produced by virulent mycobacteria. In the proposed research we will (1) Identify and study the 
sulfolid-1 receptor in neurons and experimental animals, (2) Characterize the activity of the second nociceptive 
molecule in neurons and experimental animals, and determine how its activity combines with that of sulfolipid-1 
(3) Develop and use a sophisticated Mtb transmission system to measure transmission, cough and aerosolized 
particles safely and quantitatively and use the system to compare the transmissibility of a variety of Mtb 
mutants lacking cough-inducing molecules or other factors predicted to impact transmission. The proposed 
work is expected to identify novel factors associated with nociceptive neuron activation, cough and 
mycobacterial transmission."

In 2020 malaria caused 241M clinical cases and 627,000 deaths, the greatest numbers of annual deaths since
2012. There were more deaths in Africa from malaria than from COVID-19. There is an urgent unmet medical
need for a malaria vaccine that prevents infection and disease in individuals and can be deployed in mass
vaccination programs for malaria elimination. The RTS,S malaria vaccine was shown in a pilot implementation
program in >900,000 African infants to significantly reduced hospital admissions for malaria by 21% and
severe malaria by 30%. In late 2021 it was recommended by WHO for immunization of 5-month-olds.
However, it did not significantly reduce cerebral malaria, severe malaria anemia, or overall mortality, or prevent
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infection. Of vaccines under development, only Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines have
the efficacy against Pf infection to be considered for prevention of Pf infection in individuals or geographically
focused Pf malaria elimination campaigns. Sanaria’s 1st generation vaccine, PfSPZ Vaccine, is composed of
radiation-attenuated Pf sporozoites (SPZ), which arrest early in the liver stage. Sanaria’s 2nd generation
vaccine is PfSPZ-CVac (Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine). In PfSPZ-CVac, the parasites replicate in the liver,
biologically amplifying the immunogen load by up to 50,000-fold and then are killed by an anti-malarial drug.
PfSPZ-CVac co-administered with chloroquine (CQ), gave 100% vaccine efficacy (VE) against heterologous
controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) 12 weeks after vaccination using 22% the dose of PfSPZ needed to
achieve 80% VE at 9-10 weeks against heterologous CHMI with PfSPZ Vaccine. PfSPZ-CVac (CQ) is
therefore more protective than PfSPZ Vaccine at ~1/5 the dose. However, transient symptoms of malaria can
occur after 1st dose of PfSPZ, and if CQ is not administered appropriately, parasite multiplication in the blood
could cause severe malaria. In our Phase I grant, to retain the enhanced potency of PfSPZ-CVac and eliminate
its drawbacks, we genetically altered Pf to be able to fully replicate, but arrest prior to entering the blood by
deleting first one and then a 2nd gene to produce PfSPZ-LARC2 Vaccine and produced a master cell bank
(MCB). This vaccine is now being manufactured in compliance with cGMPs to produce PfSPZ-LARC2 Vaccine
and will be assessed for safety and efficacy in a clinical trial in the 2nd half of 2022. In this Phase II grant, we
propose to 1) manufacture 2 lots of this late arresting, replication competent (LARC) vaccine (PfSPZ-LARC2),
which is based on an African Pf parasite, for assessment in expanded clinical trials, 2) manufacture a Thai
strain of Pf (NHP4026) containing Asian variant antigens for regulatory agency directed vaccine assessment,
and 3) produce a PfSPZ-LARC2 vaccine based on NHP4026 that can be combined with African LARC2 as a
pan-global vaccine if needed. The project is intended to produce a potent, cost effective PfSPZ vaccine that
protects against highly variant Pf parasites worldwide."

Child obesity is a major public health challenge. Exposure to environmental chemicals early in life may lead to
increased risk for obesity and cardiometabolic health disruption in childhood. Black carbon is a traffic-related
air pollutant that is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and early mortality in adults. Very few
previous epidemiologic studies have investigated black carbon exposure during early life and childhood obesity
and growth outcomes. Accordingly, black carbon remains an understudied, yet widespread exposure with a
biologically plausible link to disrupted cardiometabolic homeostasis. We will leverage existing data from the
Healthy Start study, a pre-birth cohort of 1,410 pregnant women enrolled 2009-2014 and their offspring
followed through age 8 years in the Denver-metropolitan area. Healthy Start has extensively phenotyped
participants on biological and anthropometric measures of childhood cardiometabolic health, including precise
body composition measures using state-of-the-art air displacement plethysmography, longitudinal measures of
body mass index (BMI), and blood biomarkers of metabolic homeostasis including fasting glucose, insulin,
lipids, and adipokines. The specific aims are: 1) to estimate associations between prenatal and childhood
exposure to black carbon and indicators of adiposity at 4-6 years, 2) to estimate associations between prenatal
and childhood exposure to black carbon and offspring cardiometabolic biomarkers at 4-6 years, and 3) to
estimate longitudinal associations of prenatal and childhood exposure to black carbon with BMI growth
trajectories from 2-8 years. We hypothesize that early-life exposure to black carbon will result in higher risk of
adverse cardiometabolic outcomes in children. The results will advance understanding of the impact of black
carbon, a specific traffic-related air pollutant, on childhood adiposity and cardiometabolic health. The findings
will provide essential information to environmental policy makers responsible for regulating the public’s
exposure to air pollution. The Applicant is a productive doctoral student at the University of Colorado- Anschutz
Medical Campus, which offers state-of-the-art research facilities, internationally recognized faculty in obesity
and diabetes, and a plethora of career development resources for doctoral students. The Applicant has
assembled a strong mentorship team that comprises environmental scientists and lifecourse epidemiology
experts and developed a comprehensive training plan to build specialized research and analytic skills,
including 1) build knowledge in lifecourse epidemiology methods and study design, 2) gain skills in analytic
approaches for complex correlated and spatially defined environmental exposures, and 3) develop
methodologic expertise in statistical modeling techniques for longitudinal data. Through the completion of the
proposed research and training plan, the Applicant will develop the skills necessary to successfully complete
the proposed project and to continue on the path towards her career goal of becoming an independent
researcher studying the impacts of environmental exposures on chronic diseases across the lifecourse."
10737639,"An increasing number of circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been found to be expressed by both viruses and
human host cells during viral infection, yet the physiological significance of most circRNAs remains unclear.
Our long-term goal is to use human polyomaviruses (HPyVs) to understand the regulation and function of
circRNAs and to leverage this knowledge towards developing new diagnostics and treatments for viral
diseases. We propose that many viral circRNAs function as coding RNAs that have distinct properties from
linear RNAs spliced from the same gene. Specifically, our central hypothesis is that Merkel cell
polyomavirus and trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus encodes circular ALTO RNAs, circALTOs, that
are translated to ALTO, which then modulates transcription in infected host cells. This model is based on
preliminary studies showing that both MCPyV and TSPyV early regions efficiently generate circALTO, which
are translated into ALTO protein in vitro. MCPyV circALTO functions as a transcriptional transactivator that
can induce the transcription of multiple genes and pathways that have previously been implicated in DNA
virus infections. We further demonstrate that a miRNA expressed from the MCPyV early region, miR-M1,
negatively regulates circALTO and ALTO levels. Extending and validating this model would represent a
ground-breaking advance in our understanding of circRNA function and regulation. This proposal will be
organized into two aims: 1) Identify the factors that regulate the formation of MCPyV circALTO and its
inhibition by the MCPyV miR-M1 miRNA and determine how these factors impact viral replication and
persistence; 2) Determine how MCPyV ALTO modulates host cell transcription and whether ALTO’s effects
on transcription are conserved in TSPyV. We will collaborate with virologists with expertise in
polyomaviruses and miRNA biology to complete the proposed aims. Completion of this proposal will not
only expand the relevance of circRNAs in virology and cell signaling but also significantly advance our
understanding of the pathogenesis of human polyomaviruses."

Studies to date suggest that the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care needs of adolescents and young
adults (AYA) with disabilities are not well met, despite the fact that this population is as likely to be sexually
active as their peers without disabilities. However, research on SRH and receipt of SRH-related health care
among AYA with disabilities remains limited. Scant evidence informs our understanding of the reproductive
healthcare needs of both young women and men with disabilities by disability type and there is no research on
reproductive healthcare service utilization across the breadth of this diverse population. Further, there are few
resources to help AYA with disabilities navigate barriers to SRH care and obtain needed services. This mixed-
methods study will examine SRH and healthcare utilization and SRH-related unmet needs among transition
age adolescents and young adults with disabilities overall and by disability type in the United States. We will
triangulate information from national survey data, interviews with AYA with disabilities, and interviews with
parents of AYA with disabilities. Our analyses will address three fundamental questions that will establish a
foundation for development and pilot testing of a tailored intervention to improve SRH care and outcomes for
AYA with disabilities, ages 15-26: 1) What disparities exist in reproductive health care service utilization by
gender and type of disability; 2) What are the barriers to SRH care for AYA with disabilities and how are these
similar or different by gender and disability type?; and 3) What SRH information and resources would enhance
knowledge, participation in care, and communication with providers for AYA with disabilities? Building on this
foundation, we will collaborate with AYA with disabilities to develop an intervention to address the identified
barriers and unmet needs. Our project directly addresses unmet needs for SRH care identified by the National
Institutes of Health, including (1) investigating barriers to reproductive health care for AYA with disabilities, and
(2) developing reproductive health education materials for use by AYA with disabilities. This project builds on
the research team’s prior research on reproductive health of teens and women with disabilities, experience in
developing health education curricula and sexual health resources for people with developmental disabilities,
and clinical expertise in provision of care to people with disabilities transitioning from adolescence to
adulthood. The expected outcome of this project is an innovative, accessible, multi-media educational toolkit to
improve SRH knowledge and activation and provider communication. Our pilot testing will provide initial
evidence on the utility of the toolkit for our target population, establishing a foundation for future efficacy testing
in a clinical trial. This project will break new ground by providing a foundation of evidence on SRH health and
healthcare outcomes, and will develop an innovative SRH educational toolkit to address barriers and
disparities among AYA with disabilities."

Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a common genetic condition that affects approximately 100,000 people of African
heritage in the US, and more than 4 million worldwide. The disease is caused by a single amino acid substitution
in b-globin that promotes a rigid sickle shape phenotype of red blood cells (RBCs) and eventually leads to
numerous clinical manifestations such as vaso-occlusive crises, hemolysis, peripheral tissue damage, renal
insufficiency, and premature death. Various therapeutic approaches have been approved or are in development
for SCD, including bone marrow transplantation, gene therapy, induction of fetal hemoglobin, and anti-sickling
agents. Clinically approved therapies often have limited effectiveness, significant side effects, or are too costly
to reach the majority of SCD patients. Treatment of SCD would be advanced by development of novel and
effective anti-sickling drugs. Our laboratory has developed an innovative imaging assay utilizing automated
microscopy and customized algorithms that detect the sickled phenotype of RBCs. This assay has been
miniaturized to the 1536-well plate format suitable for high throughput screening. Unlike previous approaches to
identifying anti-sickling compounds – which are often limited to drugs that interact directly with hemoglobin – the
new assay detects morphological changes in RBCs at very high throughput and provides identification of anti-
sickling agents targeting pathways modulating hemoglobin polymerization or RBC morphology, including
mechanisms that do not involve direct interaction with hemoglobin. This allows elucidation of new classes of
potential therapeutics for SCD, as well as novel tools for investigating the underlying mechanisms of hemoglobin
polymerization and RBC sickling. The overall goal of the R61 phase of this proposal is to generate anti-sickling
candidates for future pre-clinical and clinical studies. We will carry out large scale, high throughput drug
screening to identify molecules that prevent sickling of diseased RBCs. The resulting hits will be verified in dose
response and a series of secondary assays. Lead compounds will be selected based on physiologically
acceptable changes of hemoglobin oxygen affinity and RBC membrane deformability. Further optimization will
be carried out in the R33 phase by medicinal chemistry. As part of the R33, lead scaffolds will be synthesized
and evaluated for anti-sickling potency, hemoglobin oxygen affinity, and improved RBC membrane deformability
to identify agents best suited for animal safety and efficacy studies. Townes HbSS mice expressing human globin
genes will be used to test short term lethality, efficacy of anti-sickling activity, RBC oxygen affinity, and RBC half-
life in vivo. As the final deliverable of this proposal, 3 or more drug candidates that are safe and efficacious in
the mouse model will be selected for future pre-clinical studies."

 Dynamic acetylation/deacetylation of histones and nonhistone proteins is a critical switch in gene
regulation. Manipulation of the acetylation switch is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy in the
treatment of cancer. My laboratory has a long-term interest in clarifying the functions, mechanisms of action,
and regulation of lysine acetyltransferases and deacetylases, exploring their roles in diseases, and using the
resulting knowledge to develop new and better strategies for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. The
key focus of this resubmission application is on the Males Absent on the First (MOF, also called KAT8 or
MYST1) protein, a member of the MYST lysine acetyltransferase family. MOF regulates a variety of cellular
processes including gene transcription, DNA damage responses, and embryonic development. The proposed
project is significant because although increasing evidence suggests that MOF is also closely involved in
cancer, the exact mechanism by which MOF impacts tumor development and progression is unclear. Our
preliminary studies revealed an unexpected function of MOF in the transcriptional repression of epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cytokine genes in lung cancer. Furthermore, MOF depletion significantly
affects lung tumorigenesis in mouse models due to release of its transcriptional repression. Based on these
exciting preliminary results, we hypothesize that MOF may be a potential target for treatments of lung cancer.
The long-term objective is to explore how MOF regulates uncharacterized gene expression and signaling
processes to impact lung cancer. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
Dissect the novel and unexpected mechanisms by which MOF represses gene transcription; 2) Examine how
MOF controls gene expression via the methyltransferase G9a and TGF-beta/SMAD; and 3) Explore the
implications of SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of MOF in lung cancer development. The expected outcome of
this work will help elucidate new functions of MOF and its mechanisms of action in lung tumorigenesis, and
provide insights into future development of new therapeutic strategies for lung cancer."
10794228,"Project Summary
Addiction research emphasizes already addicted populations and not the effects of initial MA exposure. It is
likely that high initial sensitivity to aversive drug effects results in drug avoidance and reduces the probability of
addiction. Activation of glutamatergic lateral habenula (LHb) afferents projecting to dorsal raphe (DR) serotonin
(5-HT) and GABA interneurons are implicated in the perception of aversion induced by several stimuli, but
have never been examined for their role in drug-induced aversion. This proposal takes advantage of mice
selectively bred for high (MAHDR) and low (MALDR) risk for voluntary methamphetamine (MA) intake,
collectively known as the MA drinking (MADR) lines. Selection response and differential sensitivity to aversive
effects of MA (MALDR>MAHDR) have been highly reproducible. Low sensitivity to MA-induced aversion
corresponds with high voluntary MA intake in the MAHDR line, whereas the opposite relationship is found in
the MALDR line. My preliminary data confirm that acute MA administration induces cFos expression in the LHb
of MALDR mice, but not MAHDR mice. This suggests that MA activates the LHb in MALDR mice, which may
be related to their high sensitivity to MA-induced aversion. I propose a shift in the influence of LHb-mediated
direct excitatory and indirect inhibitory inputs onto DR 5-HT neurons is responsible for the difference in
sensitivity to MA-induced aversion in the MADR lines. My proposal will examine direct LHb synapses onto DR
5-HT and GABA neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetics, as well as
determine whether inhibition of the LHb-DR circuit using virally-expressed DREADDs blocks acquisition of MA-
induced place aversion in MALDR mice. Collectively, these studies will enhance our understanding of
glutamate transmission from the LHb onto DR 5-HT and GABA neurons and the effects of circuit manipulation
on sensitivity to MA aversion. This project will complement a comprehensive and structured training plan that I
have developed with my co-sponsors Drs. Richards and Ingram. In addition to advanced training in ex-vivo
electrophysiology, chemogenetics, optogenetics, and behavioral genetics, I will further cement and expand on
my skills in programming, experimental design, data dissemination and scientific writing. I will gain a deep
understanding of addiction and the possible protective role of drug-induced aversion. Additionally, I have
begun and will continue to engage in activities that are improving my abilities as a mentor. As a whole, the
proposed training will provide me the tools and skillset needed to further the development of my career as an
academic researcher in the addiction field."
10812991,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) experience progressive cognitive decline
and behavioral and functional impairment. With disease progression, individuals with ADRD also experience
heightened risk for poor outcomes which often culminate in the need for skilled care provided in nursing homes
(NH); almost all individuals with ADRD will receive short- or long-term NH care at some point. While providing
high-quality, person-centered ADRD care is a national priority, progress toward this goal is limited in part by a
lack of understanding regarding the influence of major comorbidities on ADRD disease burden, care needs, and
symptoms. In particular, comorbid serious mental illness (SMI), which is common among individuals with ADRD,
remains understudied despite its impact on disease risk, burden, care needs, and symptomatology. Burden of
both ADRD and SMI is particularly high in NH settings. Understanding whether SMI plays an additive role in
shaping behavioral symptom presentation among individuals with ADRD, care needs (e.g. pain), and outcomes
(e.g. falls) can inform intervention targets and improve person-centered care across settings. Towards this end,
I propose a mixed methods sequential explanatory design to investigate the contribution of SMI to ADRD
symptoms, outcomes, and care interventions; domains informed by the Need-Driven, Dementia-Compromised
Behavior Model. I will utilize secondary data available through the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS 3.0) (Aim 1/1A)
and conduct interviews with NH staff (Aim 2). My long-term goal is to establish a program of research designing
and delivering person-centered interventions for symptom management among adults with ADRD and complex
comorbidities. My short-term objective is to characterize ADRD/SMI’s relationship to shared and distinct
symptomology, outcomes, and care interventions; and implications for individuals with ADRD and provision of
person-centered care. Under Aim 1, I will describe patterns and characteristics of comorbid ADRD/SMI diagnosis
among NH residents using 2019 MDS 3.0 NH assessment data (N~500,000). Applying clustering techniques, I
will define underlying ADRD/SMI disease co-occurrences and their variation by demographic characteristics. I
will then evaluate how distinct ADRD/SMI comorbidities are associated with unique behavioral symptoms,
outcomes (e.g. falls, functional status) and care needs/interventions (e.g. medication use, restraint use) as
compared to ADRD alone (Aim 1A). Under Aim 2, I will explain and extend Aim1/1a findings by conducting
content analysis of interviews with NH staff (e.g. nurses, nursing assistants, social workers, providers) (N=30,
total) about their perceptions of ADRD/SMI comorbidities and care of residents with complex cognitive and
psychiatric care needs. Impact: Findings from the proposed study are responsive to ADRD research priorities
and will provide foundational data informing targets for person-centered care interventions for patients with
ADRD/SMI by illuminating the contributory role of SMI to ADRD symptoms and care. The training plan will
support my broader career goal of becoming a leading clinician scientist focused on aging and ADRD care."
10828376,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All life forms must maintain a homeostatic gene expression program, which is achieved
at many different steps in gene expression, including by the degradation of specific
mRNAs and non-coding RNAs. Many evolutionarily conserved RNA processing
enzymes mediate these key post-transcriptional events, with important roles for endo
and exoribonucleases. A number of inherited diseases are caused by mutations in endo-
or exoribonuclease genes, further underscoring their importance for human health.
Eukaryotes use exonucleases for the degradation of most cellular mRNAs and for the 5'
and 3' end processing of many different ncRNAs. In addition, endonucleases target
specific mRNAs as an initiating step in mRNA degradation and other endonucleases
process ncRNAs. This proposal will focus on the functional characterization of
ribonucleases, especially functions in cytoplasmic mRNA degradation."

 The flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the brain is essential for maintaining brain health, and
clears metabolic waste products through the glymphatic system. Disruption of this clearance process is
associated with multiple neurodegenerative disorders, notably Alzheimer’s disease. Two key mechanisms
underlying CSF flow in humans are the respiratory cycle, and coherent neural activity. This project aims to
determine whether synergistic drive of respiration and neural activity enhances CSF flow in the human brain.
We will test how spontaneous respiration is associated with CSF flow and test whether slower breathing drives
higher flow. We will then use respiratory-gated transcutaneous vagal nerve stimulation, a noninvasive
neuromodulation technique to stimulate neural activity, integrating both respiratory and neural activity to
optimally drive CSF flow. Finally, we will test how respiration and respiratory-gated neurostimulation modulate
flow both in the large ventricles, and in the tiny perivascular spaces that are essential for brain clearance, using
a new fMRI-based imaging technique with high temporal resolution to measure rhythmic dynamics in
perivascular flow. Together, these studies will establish how modulation of respiration and neural activity in
concert drives CSF flow through the brain. This work will provide the foundation for future clinical investigations
testing whether noninvasive stimulation integrating neural and respiratory rhythms can improve clinical
outcomes and protect against development of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease."
10849781,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand cortical mechanisms underlying loss, recovery, and
disorders of consciousness. We have previously characterized neural activity associated with different stages
of general anesthesia and sleep. Each of these stages is composed of distinct states of arousal and
awareness, such as fluctuations between dreaming and unconsciousness. Finding neural underpinnings of
these processes is necessary for understanding the neural basis of consciousness. This proposal takes
advantage of the unique opportunity to directly record from the human brain in neurosurgical epilepsy patients.
We will use intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) to identify signatures of unconsciousness and
distinguish it from three different states of consciousness: waking consciousness, drowsiness, and dreaming.
The scientific premise of this project is that the biomarkers of clinically relevant changes in arousal and
awareness share common features, generalizing beyond specific conditions that cause them. Our work to date
has identified putative biomarkers that show promise for distinguishing states of arousal and awareness. These
biomarkers include region-specific changes in cortical responses to unexpected sounds and speech, and in
patterns of cortical connectivity. Using innovative computational approaches applied to data obtained using
electrical stimulation and recording of ongoing brain activity at rest, we will track rapid transitions in cortical
network configurations. Characterizing these rapid transitions will enable us to identify clinically relevant
changes in arousal and awareness.
Our multimodal approach combines high resolution iEEG with computational modeling, electrical stimulation
tract tracing, conventional scalp-recorded EEG, and magnetic resonance imaging in overlapping sets of human
subjects. We will find reliable biomarkers that can identify distinct states of consciousness that occur during
induction of and emergence from general anesthesia (Specific Aim 1) and different stages of sleep (Specific
Aim 2). We will then leverage these biomarkers to understand mechanisms of delirium, which can occur in
neurosurgical patients during recovery from surgery and following seizures (Specific Aim 3).
Identifying biomarkers of consciousness has broad clinical relevance to development of novel algorithms for
monitoring depth of anesthesia. Knowledge gained from this project will contribute to improved diagnosis,
management and prognosis of pathologic states of consciousness including central sleep disorders, delirium,
vegetative or minimally conscious states, and coma."
10750956,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All life forms synthesize and maintain proteins to carry out fundamental cell processes. Protein synthesis
and maintenance require tremendous energy and resources, including Mg2+, the most abundant divalent
cation in living cells. Microbial pathogens often face nutrient limitation inside mammalian macrophages
and must restore protein homeostasis to persist in host tissues. I propose to determine how the
facultative intracellular pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium)
uses molecular chaperones to control protein homeostasis, thereby enabling survival during Mg2+
starvation. I discovered two novel functions for DnaK, the highly conserved molecular chaperone that
functions with cochaperones in folding proteins under nutrient-replete conditions. First, I established that,
surprisingly, DnaK represses protein synthesis by binding ribosomes in a cochaperone-independent
manner when S. Typhimurium experiences low Mg2+, thereby helping conserve energy and resources.
And second, I determined that DnaK antagonizes the canonical ribosome-associated chaperone Trigger
Factor, assuming its role in cotranslational folding of nascent polypeptides also during low Mg2+. I will
now elucidate the mechanism by which DnaK takes over cotranslational polypeptide folding from Trigger
Factor during Mg2+ starvation; and identify the physiological benefits of this novel DnaK function. I will
also examine how Mg2+ starvation changes the balance between the canonical DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE and
GroEL/GroES chaperone systems that act on existing proteins because protein homeostasis involves not
only synthesis of new proteins but also maintenance of existing proteins. By altering the activities of these
two chaperone systems, S. Typhimurium is hypothesized to maintain certain proteins soluble and active,
and other proteins insoluble and inactive. The starvation-induced transition to a slow growth state renders
bacteria phenotypically resistant to antibacterial agents, hindering the cure of bacterial infections. The
molecular and physiological results from this research will reveal novel control of chaperone-mediated
adaptations in human pathogens. Moreover, the universal nature of Mg2+ dependence, chaperones, and
protein homeostasis makes this study widely applicable to diverse organisms across all domains of life."
10808915,"Project Abstract / Summary
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with high relapse risk, and so identifying those most vulnerable to
relapse and heavy drinking is critical to improve AUD outcomes. Chronic pain (CP) frequently co-occurs with
AUD and promotes pain-related heavy drinking. Previous work showed significant chronic alcohol-related
neuroadaptations in stress-related neural and neuroendocrine pathways and high craving that predicted heavy
drinking and relapse outcomes. Current preliminary data indicates that AUD patients with CP (AUD+/CP+) and
also AUD-/CP+ drinkers report higher cue-induced craving and greater heavy drinking days (HDD), along with
specific pain-related insula dysregulation that predicts high cue-induced craving and greater HDD. However,
the specific alterations in pain-related neural and biobehavioral circuits that promote pain-related heavy
drinking is not known. Based on this preliminary data and previous research, we hypothesize that specific
alcohol-related insula neuroadaptations promote higher cue-related alcohol craving and greater pain-related
HDD, and that reduction in this specific insula dysregulation and in cue-related alcohol craving with effective
standard behavioral treatment will improve pain-related alcohol heavy drinking outcomes in those with AUD+
and CP+ non-AUD drinkers. In a 2 X 2 experimental design with a prospective clinical outcomes phase, men
and women with AUD, with/without CP, and non-AUD individuals with/without CP will be studied in two related
studies utilizing combined multimethod subjective, neuroendocrine, neural MRI assessments and prospective
alcohol use outcomes. The following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: To examine chronic alcohol- and
pain- specific subjective (pain, stress, craving), neural and neuroendocrine responses to visual cue blocks
(stress/pain, alcohol, neutral) in AUD (+/-) and CP (+/-) groups. Aim 2: To examine whether specific AUD+ and
CP+ neuroadaptations in primary and secondary predictors are associated with prospective, real-world daily
alcohol craving, pain and alcohol use outcomes. Aim 3: To evaluate changes in primary and secondary
predictors with CBT for AUD and for CP, and whether treatment-related neural, endocrine and subjective
responses during fMRI predict treatment-related improvements in daily pain, craving and alcohol use outcomes
during the 8-week treatment period. Aim 4: To assess the effects of demographic (sex, age, race) and clinical
(trauma, psychiatric history) variables on primary and secondary predictors of AUD and CP comorbidity and on
drinking outcomes. Exploratory Aim: To explore whole brain pain-specific structural gray matter volume
(GMV) and task-based functional connectivity using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) at scan 1,
and prediction of changes in pain-related structural GMV and drinking connectomes with CBT treatment.
Successful completion of the proposed aims will identify chronic alcohol-related pain-specific neural, subjective
and neuroendocrine correlates contributing to increased pain-related alcohol use outcomes, that may then be
targeted in treatment development to reduce pain-related drinking outcomes to improve AUD risk and recovery."

Antibody-based immunotherapies have become an established paradigm for treating cancers. Only a small
portion of patients have benefited from these agents, though, and many are only effective for treating a small set
of tumors. This is due, in part, to a lack of validated cell surface targets. Only a dozen of surface proteins has
been approved for antibody intervention, and most are not truly exclusive to malignant cells. There has been
growing interesting in searching the cellular immunopeptidome for tumor-exclusive targets. The
immunopeptidome is a pool of peptides generated from proteolysis of intracellular proteins and displayed on the
cell surface as a complex with the human leukocyte antigens (HLA). It is thought that this peptide repertoire
reflects the status of the intracellular proteome and can be modulated by driver oncogenes. Epitopes harboring
driver mutations, or neo-antigens, have been detected as peptide-HLA complexes (pHLAs) from tumor samples.
However, the mechanism of how oncogene signaling shape the immunopeptidome remains uncharacterized.
The goals of this proposal are to develop technologies to map changes in the immunopeptidome unique to
specific ongene, and tools to mount an immune response against them. These findings will ultimately aid in
developing antibody-based biologics with better safety profile and more applicable to diverse types of cancers.
Here, we hypothesized that proliferative oncogenes globally alter the immunopeptidome via transcriptional
remodeling and alternative splicing, and induce unique pHLAs beyond mutated fragments of parent
oncoproteins. To test this hypothesis, we will first develop a new mass spectrometry technique to map diseased
immunopeptidome in an allele-specific manner. Next, we will combine this technique with a reductionist cell
model approach to study the immunopeptidome of isogenic cell lines overexpressing specific oncogene. The
immunopeptidomics data will be complemented by protein databases and transcript analyses to reveal key
contributors of oncogene-specific pHLAs. Collectively, the proposed work will provide insight to how a single
genetic alteration can impact mechanisms of antigen presentation and produce neo-antigens on the cell surface.
To build on these discoveries, we will also engineer antibodies to recognize pHLAs of interest with high affinity
and peptide specificity. These reagents will be further elaborated into chimeric antigen receptors to arm cytotoxic
T cells and mount antitumor response against cells displaying oncogene-specific pHLAs. These reagents will be
tested in cultured cells, and humanized mice models. In the long term, the basic biological insights and antibody
tools generated from the proposed studies will bolster ongoing efforts to understanding the cancerous
immunopeptidome and lay the foundation for future therapeutics targeting neo-antigens."

Adaptive optics (AO) scanning ophthalmoscopy allows non-invasive visualization of microscopic retinal
structures by correcting the optical blur that is unique to each eye. In these instruments, however, image
distortion due to involuntary fixational eye movement is a barrier to improving the understanding, early
diagnosing, and management of eye disease. We propose to develop high-bandwidth eye motion stabilization
technology and image registration software to mitigate this distortion even in subjects with the most extreme
forms of involuntary eye motion, including nystagmus. This will be achieved by using a high frame rate pupil
tracker that measures the eye’s orientation and by steering galvanometric optical scanners to simultaneously
stabilize the view of the pupil and the retina as seen by AO scanning ophthalmoscopes with sub-millisecond total
latency. Our goal here is to develop low-cost, low-complexity, and high-bandwidth retinal imaging stabilization
instrumentation that can be used to upgrade both AO and non-AO ophthalmoscopes, using control algorithms
that incorporate eye motion prediction, electronic and mechanical latency. Finally, we will also develop image
registration software for scanning ophthalmoscopes that uses the high frame rate pupil tracking to improve
accuracy and reduce failure rate, as well as automate the identification of and un-distort reference frames. The
proposed technology will be applicable to all scanning ophthalmoscopes, irrespective of imaging modality."

 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is an extremely prevalent disease in the United States, affecting approximately 1
in 10 adults, and it is estimated that 640 million people will be diagnosed with diabetes by 2040. While T2D is
associated with β-cell failure, defects in both insulin and glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islet contribute
to dysregulated blood glucose. As current therapies that target β-cells to increase insulin secretion have limited
success, innovative ideas that focus on novel mechanisms for regulation of blood glucose are necessary to
create new therapeutics to combat T2D. Glucagon secretion by α-cells has strong control over the magnitude of
insulin secretion, making α-cells an attractive target for new therapies. The second messenger cAMP is a strong
determinant of glucagon secretion. Glucose has been shown to regulate α-cell cAMP intrinsically and
extrinsically. Preliminary studies show that leucine strongly reduces α-cell cAMP independently of islet paracrine
signaling, KATP channel effects, or calcium. Furthermore, in a similar fashion, glucose and leucine can dampen
amino acid-stimulated glucagon secretion. Glucose and leucine are both strongly anaplerotic, and preliminary
data suggests that the mitochondrial enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK2), an essential effector
of mitochondrial anaplerosis-cataplerosis, plays an important role in the regulation of amino acid-dependent
glucagon secretion. We hypothesize that anaplerotic fuels such as leucine and glucose will decrease cAMP
through PCK2 to inhibit glucagon release. To study this hypothesis we will: 1) Determine the intrinsic vs.
paracrine (via β/δ-cells) effects of leucine on α-cell cAMP and 2) Determine whether α-cell PCK2 mediates the
inhibitory effects of anaplerotic fuels. These aims will be studied by TIRF and lightsheet microscopy in
combination with novel genetic mouse models and biosensors, to examine role of anaplerotic fuels on α-cell
cAMP and glucagon secretion. Successful completion of this project will characterize new connections between
anaplerosis and cAMP signaling, train the PI in state of the art techniques for the study of metabolism, and
potentially unlock a new pathway to target for the treatment of T2D."

Stress-exposure may lead to negative physical and psychological responses. Stress can be especially
problematic for people trying to recover from opioid use disorder (OUD) because it impairs executive function
(EF) and increases craving and likelihood of relapse. The applicant’s Sponsor (Dr. Greenwald) demonstrated
that pharmacological stress increases drug-seeking behavior; however, the mechanisms by which stress
impacts behavior are not fully understood. Moreover, there are no FDA-approved medications to reduce effects
of stress on cognitive function and current OUD treatments do not effectively address stress. The goals of this
training project are to train the applicant in neurobiological mechanisms involved in substance use
disorders (SUDs) while developing skills in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and
EEG techniques. These goals will be accomplished by expanding the Sponsor’s work to determine the
roles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in modulating
stress-induced drug-seeking, and to investigate how modulation of these targets alters stress-induced
cognitive and affective functions. Neuromodulation with rTMS is a promising tool for developing a deeper
understanding of mechanisms relating stress to drug-related outcomes. The Competing Neurobehavioral
Decisions System theory posits that persons with SUDs may have hyperactive limbic reward circuitry and
hypoactive executive control circuitry; this theory supports using rTMS to target limbic reward (via mPFC) or
executive control (via dlPFC) circuitry to modulate drug seeking. Using a mixed design, we will examine the
effects of pharmacological stressor (54mg yohimbine + 20mg hydrocortisone) vs. placebo (within subject) in
conjunction with either 10Hz dlPFC vs. sham rTMS (group 1) or 1Hz mPFC vs. sham rTMS (group 2) in
participants with OUD. Overall hypothesis: Excitation of EF circuitry via dlPFC rTMS or inhibition of limbic
circuitry via mPFC rTMS will attenuate stress-induced executive dysfunction (Aim 1) or emotional dysregulation
(Aim 2), respectively, relative to sham. rTMS of either target will attenuate stress-induced opioid-seeking (Aim
3). The experimental design, rigorous and reproducible methods, and innovative hypotheses are based on
scientific literature and strong preliminary and published data from the Sponsor’s lab. Significance: This
project will systematically advance understanding of neurobiological mechanisms of stress-reactivity and drug
use in OUD, forming the foundation for future programmatic inquiry. Potential future research would evaluate:
(1) the role of stimulating other brain structures to reduce stress response; (2) use of brain imaging and other
biomarkers to further explore mechanisms in response to these interventions; and (3) effects of multiple rTMS
sessions on modulating longer-term patterns of drug use. The applicant has assembled a strong mentorship
team who already collaborate, have unique and intersecting expertise relevant to this project, and will provide
the interdisciplinary training experience necessary to meet her career goals as a physician-scientist."

change, microplastics, and new types of chemicals. We have also become increasingly aware that minoritized
and low-income communities confront more environmental harm than other communities. Therefore, our
theme, “Re-envisioning environmental health and justice in a changing world,” captures the vision for the next
funding period of the Center for Environmental Health and Justice in Northern Manhattan (CEHJNM). The
Center’s work will be articulated across five directions that reflect our strengths and interests, which we will
advance through corresponding working groups: (1) Environmental Justice; (2) Advancing the Exposome; (3)
Environmental Data Science; (4) Biological and Molecular Mechanisms; and (5) Climate and Health
The mission of the CEHJNM is to understand health concerns caused by environmental exposures and
address environmental inequities through translational science and partnerships. CEHJNM is housed in the
low-income neighborhood of Washington Heights, surrounded by communities in Harlem and the South Bronx
disproportionally burdened by harmful environmental conditions. Our Community Engagement Core builds on
a longstanding and impactful collaboration with our primary local partner, WE ACT for Environmental Justice—
a highly visible non-profit Harlem organization dedicated to environmental justice and proposes new methods
of identifying and collaborating with community groups and supporting research to examine and ameliorate
environmental health disparities. We house a Career Development Program that has successfully supported
scientists at Columbia University and will now also work with Agents of Change in Environmental Justice, a
national program that trains and empowers emerging investigators from historically excluded backgrounds. Our
Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core will integrate the expertise of six laboratories in sampling, processing,
and state-of-the-art analysis of environmental and biological matrices. Our Study Design and Data Science
Facility Core facilitates the use of contemporary study designs and a wide array of data management,
biostatistics, and data science approaches.
CEHJNM’s Pilot Project Program has a 6-week turnaround from submission to funding for full applications
(≤35K) and one-week turnaround for mini-pilots (≤10K). Pilots have stimulated innovative directions—ranging
from new laboratory methods to data science and community partnerships—and has yielded 40-fold returns in
external funding; in the current cycle, 87% of the pilot funding was awarded to Principal Investigators who were
early-career faculty or non-members at the time of the award. Building on CEHJNM’s record of success, we
propose through this application a renewed organizational structure, enhanced services, and strategic future

10611525,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autophagy is a cellular, homeostatic process with important roles in aging and age-related diseases. During
autophagy, cytosolic material or cargo is sequestered into autophagic vesicles called autophagosomes for
subsequent lysosomal degradation; however, the underlying mechanisms for how the turover of specific types
of cargo, e.g., protein aggregates or mitochondria, collectively referred to as selective autophagy, contributes
to cellular proteostasis and organismal health remain elusive.
 We and others recently showed a conserved role for the first identified autophagy cargo receptor in
metazoans, p62/SQSTM1 in mediating proteostasis and organismal benefits in an autophagy-dependent
manner. In particular, we showed that p62 overexpression in the short-lived nematode C. elegans is sufficient
to induce autophagy and extend life- and healthspan, and protect against protein aggregation predominantly in
neurons. Moreover, p62 is selectively required for the beneficial effects of a hormetic heat shock, a conserved
longevity regimen that we previously showed to induce autophagy. Collectively, these studies suggest the
hypothesis that p62 plays an instructive role in inducing tissue-specific, selective autophagy to facilitate
organismal benefits. This is a novel concept because autophagy receptors are traditionally viewed as factors
facilitating cargo sequestration, rather than being active inducers of this complex, multi-step turnover process.
 We propose to address this hypothesis by using C. elegans to investigate the molecular mechanisms by
which a hormetic heat shock via p62 or direct p62 overexpression regulate autophagy cell autonomously and
improve organismal health via cell non-autonomous effects. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will use genetic
approaches to test how a hormetic heat shock engages p62 to regulate autophagy especially in neurons. In
Aim 2, we will investigate the cell-autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms by which p62 induce
autophagy and improve fitness. Finally, in Aim 3, we will use genetic and biochemical approaches to identify
new p62-relevant cargo and p62-like receptors engaged by hormetic heat shock. These studies are significant
because they will advance our knowledge of how selective autophagy contributes to organismal healthspan.
 These studies are innovative because they use a powerful combination of techniques and models to
investigate the novel regulatory concept in the autophagy field that an autophagy receptor is sufficient to
induce beneficial autophagy, potentially via cell non-autonomous mechanisms. Since autophagy plays critical
roles in many human age-related disorders, understanding the regulation of autophagy and the conserved
mechanisms by which autophagy affect aging in multicellular organisms like C. elegans are likely to provide
new important insights relevant to aging, which also may help develop treatments for age-related diseases."

10708156,"“Restoration of Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycemia U01 Consortium: University of Kentucky”
Abstract
For insulin-treated people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), hypoglycemia is the rate limiting step in their goals to
appropriately control their blood sugar and avoid long-term diabetes complications. Unfortunately, repeated
episodes of hypoglycemia have been shown to induce a pathological process leading to impaired awareness
of hypoglycemia (IAH) and an impaired counterregulatory response hypoglycemia that increases the risk for
life-threatening hypoglycemia. This grant application (in response to RFA-DK-21-020) seeks to establish a 10-
site clinical consortium to determine the factors that contribute to the heterogeneity in the restoration of IAH
and improved counterregulatory responses in adult individuals with T1D. It is proposed to test the hypothesis
that a combination of, 1) advanced diabetes care technology comprised of a hybrid closed loop insulin pump
with continuous glucose monitor (CGM), coupled with 2) intensive hypoglycemia avoidance education, will lead
to a decrease in the frequency/severity of hypoglycemia and thereby improve the awareness of hypoglycemia
and improve the counterregulatory response. The specific aims of this proposal, as outlined in the RFA, are; 1)
determine if diabetes care with use of the most up-to-date management strategies (i.e. a hybrid closed loop
system and hypoglycemia avoidance education) which optimizes HbA1c while minimizing hypoglycemia can
restore awareness of hypoglycemia in individuals with T1D and IAH, 2) determine the physiological factors that
are associated with restoration of hypoglycemia awareness and counterregulatory response, including but not
limited to age, duration of diabetes and metrics of glycemia (eg, time in range, time spent in hypoglycemia or
other CGM metrics), and 3) determine the association of the current self-report questionnaires (or develop new
metrics) for identification of IAH with measurement of CRR using ""state of the art"" metabolic assessments, i.e.
hypoglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamps. The University of Kentucky is well-poised to contribute to this valuable
consortium effort because 1) the University has the requisite institutional infrastructure to support all aspects of
this research, 2) this proposal outlines several novel approaches to measure and analyze hypoglycemia
awareness, 3) the PI has assembled an experienced leadership team has the requisite expertise in T1D
subject recruitment and conducting hypoglycemia awareness studies, and importantly, 4) this site will provide
the NIDDK with access to unique pool of US-based, often understudied, rural study subjects with T1D."

Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN) is one of the most harmful, common,
painful, and disabling side effects of many chemotherapy agents and there is no effective
treatment for it. Our pilot phase IIB two-arm trial showed that yoga treatment is associated with
reduced CIPN pain and reduced risk of falls compared to usual care control. We aim to
increase cancer patients’ function and quality of life by identifying effective treatments to
alleviate chemotherapy-related toxicities. The goal of the proposed project is to determine the
efficacy of yoga in treating CIPN pain and improving function, as well as to improve sensory
nerve recovery and reduce the risk of falls in cancer survivors suffering from moderate to
severe CIPN pain. We will conduct a phase III, randomized, education and usual care-
controlled trial with 268 participants to: 1) determine the efficacy of an eight-week yoga
treatment on CIPN symptoms among cancer survivors with moderate to severe CIPN pain; 2)
evaluate the effect of yoga versus education control and usual care on improving flexibility and
reducing the risk of falls; and 3) evaluate the effect of yoga versus education control and usual
care on quality of life and sensory fiber functioning."
10811769,"Abstract 
Understanding how environmental factors trigger dysregulated immune responses was identified as a key challenge in preclinical research for the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Dysregulated responses to the luminal environment by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) have been widely postulated to be a driver of IBD. On the other hand, the success of immunomodulatory biologics, such as vedolizumab and ustekinumab, clearly demonstrate the central role of T cells, especially pathogenic T cells, in IBD. However, it remains unclear how IECs convey innate immune detection at mucosal surfaces to adaptive immune responses and subsequent inflammation. Emerging at the center of this sensing function is the inflammasome, which can detect cellular stress and danger signals, such as ATP, found in injured tissues during chronic inflammation. In our quest to understand the role of the inflammasome in IECs, we found that IECs release large amounts of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) containing polyubiquitinated IL-1 family cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-18, in response to inflammasome activation in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Importantly, IEC-derived sEVs represent a novel form of communication between IECs and T cells. In particular, IL-18 promotes inflammatory pathogenic T cells via induction of IFN? and GM-CSF production. sEVs-derived from inflamed mouse colons exacerbate disease and confer resistance to anti-TNF treatment in a T cell transfer colitis model. Consistently, IECs from biopsies of inflamed areas from IBD patients displayed enhanced capacity to produce sEVs compared to that from non-inflamed areas. Thus, we hypothesize that IEC-derived sEVs play a critical role in IBD pathogenesis by amplifying epithelial inflammatory responses and promoting pathogenic T cells via the release of sEVs containing IL-1 family cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-18, and perhaps IL-33. This application seeks to determine the molecular mechanism(s) that underlie the release of sEVs and assess the importance of sEVs in promoting pathogenic T cells and anti-TNF therapy failure in murine models of colitis and in patient-derived specimens from IBD patients."

Early diagnosis offers the best chance of survival, yet only 30% of Veterans with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed
at early stages. Our proposal focuses on optimizing early diagnosis of patients with clinical findings suggestive
of pancreatic cancer who are at risk for delayed diagnosis through identifying and reducing missed opportunities
in diagnosis (MODs). MODs are defined as instances in which post-hoc judgement indicates that alternative
decisions or actions could have led to a more timely diagnosis.
Significance/Impact. This proposal is centered around the VA HSR&D priority areas of quality and
safety and health care informatics. There are few systematic efforts to improve quality of cancer care for Veterans
with pancreatic cancer. This proposal is one of the first large-scale efforts to examine the gaps in care for these
patients. We propose to develop electronic trigger tools that, when implemented, will have the potential to identify
possible missed opportunities to either initiate or complete the diagnostic process for earlier pancreatic cancer
diagnosis. Our results will also serve as foundational for developing informatics-based diagnosis tools for several
other high-risk conditions, including other cancer types.
 Innovation. The development of novel decision support tools (e-triggers) to reduce diagnostic delays in
pancreatic cancer represents the first e-trigger tool that is centered on pancreatic cancer care and built around
a constellation or combination of “red flags” as opposed to a single “red flag” as in all prior works on the topic.
Our study is also conceptually innovative because it represent a first step towards moving e-trigger tools to
reduce diagnostic delays in pancreatic cancer from the research environment into the clinical setting.
 Specific Aims. Our goal is to improve the diagnostic process for pancreatic cancer by developing
effective decision support tools. We have 3 aims. Aim 1: To identify missed opportunities for pancreatic cancer
diagnosis. Aim 2: To develop electronic algorithms (i.e., e-trigger tools) to identify high-risk Veterans with
potential missed opportunities for pancreatic cancer diagnosis. Aim 3: To conduct a formative assessment of e-
trigger tools to guide future testing and implementation in clinical practice.
 Methodology. In Aim 1, we will randomly select 500 pancreatic cancer cases from an already
established national VA cohort for structured review of their medical records to identify the frequency and types
of MODs as well as key patient-, provider-, and system-specific factors linked to these missed opportunities. In
Aim 2, based on the findings of Aim 1 and what is known from the literature, we will develop up to 5 e-trigger
tools to identify patients at high-risk for potential MODs through automated identification of specific patterns in
clinical electronic health record data. In Aim 3 we will perform formative assessment through stakeholder
interviews with Veterans, health care providers, and operational personnel to identify barriers and facilitators to
implementing developed e-triggers in clinical practice, as well as a host of socio-technical factors.
 Implementation/Next Steps. The proposed research will develop health care informatics tools to identify
opportunities for earlier pancreatic cancer diagnosis among high-risk patient subgroups who warrant diagnostic
evaluation. In the next steps, we will examine the effectiveness of our informatics tools (e-trigger tools) to improve
quality of pancreatic cancer care in the VA through a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation study. This
multidisciplinary research, along with career development and mentoring plans, will increase knowledge of earlier

10819165,"ABSTRACT
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by inflexible compulsive drinking despite negative consequences.
This behavioral inflexibility is associated with deficits in reversal learning. The thalamus and the dorsomedial
striatum (DMS) are critical reversal learning in flexible behavior. The DMS contains principal medium spiny
neurons (MSNs). MSNs are located either in the direct-pathway (dMSNs) or indirect-pathway (iMSNs) of the
basal ganglia. Both dMSNs and iMSNs receive cortical inputs and positively and negatively regulate the
selection of “Go” actions, respectively. The DMS also contains cholinergic interneurons (CINs). CIN release
acetylcholine to modulate MSN activity. During reversal learning, thalamic inputs excite DMS CINs to generate
burst-pause firing and stop ongoing actions. It is not known how thalamically evoked CIN activity regulates
MSNs in AUD and contributes to inflexible behavior. The goal of this application is to study how excessive
ethanol intake alters thalamostriatal transmission, leading to behavioral inflexibility. Our long-term objective is
to develop new therapeutics to restore behavioral flexibility and treat AUD. The hypothesis, based in part on
applicant’s preliminary results, is that excessive ethanol intake compromises thalamic regulation of DMS CINs
and CIN-mediated regulation of cortical inputs onto dMSNs and iMSN, leading to inflexible behaviors, which
can be counteracted by optogenetic excitation of thalamostriatal transmission onto CINs. We will test this
hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims. (1) Investigate whether excessive ethanol intake
reduces the burst-pause response of DMS CINs and acetylcholine release from CINs. (2) Determine whether
excessive ethanol intake compromises CIN-mediated regulation of corticostriatal transmission in DMS MSNs.
And (3) evaluate the ability of optogenetic excitation of thalamic inputs onto DMS CINs to improve reversal
learning in animals with a history of excessive ethanol intake. This research is conceptually innovative because
it focuses on the relatively neglected area of the cholinergic contribution to AUD. It is technically innovative in
its use of combined genetically encoded acetylcholine sensors, dual-channel optogenetics, and rabies-
mediated expression systems at a synapse with defined pre- and postsynaptic sites to determine the
cholinergic contribution to ethanol-mediated inflexibility. These essential research questions cannot be
addressed using conventional methodologies. Knowledge generated from this proposal will provide novel
strategies for reversing inflexible behavior and thereby reduce excessive ethanol intake in AUD."
10848273,"PROJECT SUMMARY: “RECRUITMENT OF THE BRCA1-ASSOCIATED HOMOLOGOUS
RECOMBINATION MACHINERY”
A substantial proportion of tumors show patterns of mutation that arise because of problems with DNA repair.
Deficiencies in key DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1, PALB2 and BRCA2, are associated with inefficient
DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). Each of these factors is required to load the key HR
intermediate, RAD51, at DNA double-strand break sites. The exact mechanism by which BRCA1 is recruited to
DNA break sites and becomes activated is not fully understood. Efforts to design effective therapies to
counteract DNA repair deficiencies are undermined by this lack of understanding of BRCA1 function.
The overall goal of this proposal is to produce an integrated model for how BRCA1 becomes localized and
activated at DNA break sites. This goal will be realized by investigating three mechanisms that control the
recruitment of the BRCA1-associated repair machinery. First, the contribution of BARD1 for BRCA1
recruitment will be evaluated. BARD1 is a RING domain protein that partners with BRCA1, and appears to
control the recruitment of BRCA1 to DNA break sites in the early time points after DNA damage. Preliminary
results with novel mouse models have demonstrated that the interaction of BARD1 with BRCA1 is essential for
normal DNA repair. Work in this proposal will clarify the mechanism by which BARD1 controls BRCA1 repair
activities. Secondly, the mechanism of TOPBP1-dependent recruitment of BRCA1 will be identified. TOPBP1 is
a large scaffold protein that loads onto chromatin at DNA damage sites and recruits multiple DNA repair
factors. Through the use of advanced proteomic methods to study the protein interaction networks of BRCA1
after induction of DNA breaks, a DNA damage-dependent association of BRCA1 with TOPBP1 has been
revealed. These protein complexes of TOPBP1 and BRCA1 may be instrumental for driving productive HR,
and will be evaluated in detail in this proposal. The third part of the proposal focuses on how post-translational
modification by ubiquitination and SUMOylation of proteins at break sites affects BRCA1-mediated HR. In
particular, RNF4, a ‘SUMO-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase’, with a known role in DNA repair, will be the subject of
further investigation. RNF4 mutations are found in breast cancer cells, often in association with mutations in
the key cellular growth regulator, p53. Using a conditional knockout mouse model that was recently generated
in this lab, in conjunction with mouse models of breast cancer and medulloblastoma, the importance of RNF4
for prevention of tumor formation will be measured. This research will deepen our understanding of the
regulation of BRCA1 at DNA break sites, and identify potential targets and/or avenues to prevent mutations
caused by defective DNA repair."
10848278,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and PALB2 predispose to breast cancer and also increase the risks
of ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and other cancers. The products of the 3 genes constitute a BRCA1-PALB2-
BRCA2 axis that plays essential roles in the DNA damage response, particularly in DNA double strand break
repair by homologous recombination (HR). In addition, BRCA1 and BRCA2 have also been implicated in the
regulation of DNA replication after DNA damage, as their mutant cells are defective in the intra-S phase
checkpoint, which slows down DNA synthesis after the damage presumably to allow time for DNA repair and
minimize the generation of mutations. However, the mechanisms by which the two proteins regulate DNA
synthesis have remained elusive, and the impact of such “unrestrained” DNA synthesis on replication fidelity and
genome stability after DNA damage remains unknown. In our preliminary studies, we found that BRCA2 interacts
with an essential DNA replication factor, MCM10, and that either loss of BRCA2 or disruption of the BRCA2-
MCM10 interaction results in unrestrained replication fork speed, reduced fork stalling, and reduced origin firing
after DNA damage and replication stress. Moreover, we also found that loss of BRCA1 leads to reduced
replication fork speed both before and after DNA damage. In this proposal, we will determine how BRCA2 and
BRCA1 regulate DNA replication kinetics, the impact of unrestrained DNA synthesis on replication fidelity and
therapy response, and the potential of replication stress inducers as a targeted therapy for BRCA and PALB2
mutant cancers. In Aim 1, we will define the mechanisms of BRCA2 and BRCA1 in the regulation of replication
fork speed, fork stalling and origin firing after replication stress induced by topoisomerase inhibitors. In Aim 2,
we will engineer triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines to assess the impact of replication kinetics
dysregulation on replication fidelity, cancer cell response to topoisomerase inhibitors and potential relapse after
treatment. In Aim 3, we will use conditional knockout and syngeneic mouse models to determine the efficacy of
replication stress inducers on Brca1, Brca2 and Palb2 null mammary tumors."
10848283,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Induction of a DNA break initiates DNA damage signaling pathways that lead to coordinated and dynamic
modification of the local chromatin landscape, including regulated changes in post-translational modification of
histones flanking the site of DNA damage. These chromatin changes are required to recruit repair complexes
to the site of damage, and repress transcription of genes flanking the break during repair. We recently found
that euchromatic histone methyl transferase 2 (EHMT2, also known as G9a) plays a crucial role in regulating
DNA repair. EHMT2 is rapidly recruited to sites of DNA breaks in a manner dependent on its phosphorylation
by ATM at serine 569. Interestingly, the methyl-transferase activity of EHMT2 is required for the early, H2AX-
independent recruitment of DNA repair factors including RNF8, 53BP1 and BRCA1; We have also recently
found that EHMT2 activity is required for normal regulation of key features of ATM-mediated induction of
transcriptional silencing near a DNA break. This includes regulation and recruitment of key silencing factors
such as BMI1 and CDYL. These findings suggest that EHMT2 has a key role in regulating both DNA repair
efficiency and modulating transcriptional regulation near a DNA break. As small molecule inhibitors of EHMT2
are now being developed for clinical use, EHMT2 may be one of the components of the DNA repair pathway
that may be therapeutically targetable. We hypothesize that EHMT2 activity during the DNA damage response
is 1) required to mediate local transcriptional silencing by regulating both histone and non-histone substrates 2)
enables the early, H2AX independent, recruitment of DNA repair factors to sites of DNA damage through the
action of key binding partners and substrates and 3) is critical for cell survival in the presence of specific
cancer-associated DNA repair defects. These hypotheses will be investigated through the following set of
specific aims. Aim 1. Determine the role of EHMT2 in DNA-damage-induced transcriptional silencing. Aim 2:
Determine role of EHMT2 in H2AX-indpendent recruitment of DNA repair factors. Aim 3: Define synthetic lethal
interactions of EHMT2 in DNA repair and chromatin regulation. To address these aims we will use carefully
interrogate the effect of EHMT2 loss and inhibition on multiple aspects of DNA repair and local chromatin
landscape near a DNA break. This will be done in cell and mouse systems where induction of DNA damage is
engineered at specific genomic locations, and the effect of DNA damage on local chromatin landscape and
recruitment of DNA repair factors can be systematically interrogated. We will also determine how EHMT2
inhibition using small molecule catalytic inhibitors perturbs repair pathway and survival in both wt cells and
cells harboring specific, clinically relevant mutations in DNA repair pathways, including ATM, BRCA1, PALB2
and BRCA2. By this approach we will gain new insight into the fundamental role of EHMT2 in regulating DNA
repair, and develop synthetic lethal strategies to target cancers harboring specific defects in DNA repair or
chromatin regulation with EHMT2 inhibitors."

10848288,"The BRCA Network in Medulloblastoma Responses to Replication Stress (Project-4)
Abstract:
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are critical genes for the repair of DNA strand breaks (DSB) via homologous
recombination (HR). PALB2 functions to bridge BRCA1 with BRCA2. Due to the intimate relationship between
BRCA1, PALB2, and BRCA2, these genes and their coded proteins are considered the core of a “BRCA
network.” Cancers with BRCA mutations display unique molecular features of “BRCAness,” including
hypersensitivity to replication stress drugs. In addition to the core BRCA proteins, defects of other BRCA1/2-
associated genes often share the “BRCAness” characteristics.
Brain tumors are the leading cause of childhood cancer-related deaths, and medulloblastomas (MBs) account
for more than 60% of pediatric tumors. Current treatments of MBs mainly rely on local control by radiation in
combination with generic chemotherapy. Targeted therapy has not been vigorously considered for MBs.
Recently, it has been recognized that germline mutations in BRCA2 and PALB2, two of the core genes in the
“BRCA Network,” are among the top causes of MBs. Furthermore, widespread basal activation of DNA
damage signaling and excessive replication stress were common among different groups of MBs. Based on
genomic signatures, 20-30% of sporadic MBs, including those from MB groups 2, 3, and 4, likely bear HR
defects (HRD). These recent developments raise an important question of whether DNA damage repair
defects and replication stress represent common vulnerabilities of MBs to new therapeutic developments
targeting HRD. If so, how to efficiently identify the individual cases with HRD remains an issue.
In the preliminary studies, we established conditional knockouts of Brca1, Palb2, and Brca2 in embryonic
multi-potential stem and progenitor cells using the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter-driven Cre
expression. For the first time, we demonstrated that conditional loss of Palb2 and Brca1 are effective inducers
of MBs, with a similar potency as that of Brca2 loss. An initial genomic characterization of these MBs exhibiting
“BRCAness” had identified several unique structural features that can be used to define the HRD status. By
treating the de novo MBs with a developing topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, we found it to be very effective to
extend the survival of mice with MBs. Thus, we hypothesize that MBs originated from BRCA defects have
unique genomic signatures to define the MBs with HRD, and targeted therapy of MBs with HRD will be more
effective than the current treatment regimens. In Project-4, we take advantage of our recent success in
establishing BRCA-related mouse MB models and strive to identify the genomic signatures associated with
HRD and to validate the MB “BRCAness” response to replication stress drugs. Aim 1 will identify the structural
and chromosome-context signatures that accurately reflect the HDR status in MBs exhibiting “BRCAness”.
Aim 2 will experimentally target the vulnerability of HRD in MBs and investigate the potential mechanism of
tumor recurrence after the treatment. The success of this study would effectively establish a new remedy for
MB treatment."
10817919,"Abstract: Research in the Rochester Environmental Health Sciences Center (EHSC) spans the translational 
spectrum that includes basic discovery (using experimental and epidemiologic approaches), informing solutions 
(interventions, risk assessment and management), and delineating health impacts of environmental exposures 
and policy changes. Since its inception in 2007, the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) of the 
EHSC has maintained a sustained track record of facilitating research across the translational research 
spectrum. The IHSFC structure is poised to strategically advance translational research on exposures and 
interactions of environmental factors that affect health and disease across the lifespan. Its core services 
provide expertise in contemporary research models, exposure and epigenetic analysis, and human subjects 
research. The IHSFC has four facilities with broad translational capabilities: Behavioral Sciences Facility, 
Inhalation Exposure Facility, Epigenetics Facility, and Elemental Analysis Facility. Integrating these services and 
technologies within the IHSFC promotes efficiency and access for all Center members. The IHSFC is led by a 
dynamic team of Co-Directors who are internationally recognized experts in their respective fields. The IHSFC 
Co-Directors use their substantial administrative expertise to coordinate the Core and integrate its activities with 
the other Center components and with other resources at the University. They also provide expertise in 
translational environmental health sciences research, including human subjects research. The four IHSFC 
facilities are directed by highly collaborative faculty members with successful track records of conducting 
multidisciplinary research. The IHSFC engages with Center researchers, others at the University, and community 
partners to promote collaborations and advance the mission of the Center. The IHSFC helps Center members 
identify needs and connect with services to enhance their research program. Also, IHSFC Co-Directors and 
Facility leaders are integrally involved with the University of Rochester Clinical & Translational Sciences Institute 
(CTSI), enabling them to foster collaborations and cross-utilization of CTSI resources to enhance EHSC 
research. Moreover, by working closely with the Community Engagement Core, we identify opportunities to 
support research that responds to community needs. Third, the specific objectives of the IHSFC are to: (1) 
Provide a portal of entry to facilitate and integrate research by members of the EHSC across the translational 
research spectrum; (2) Support unique research opportunities provided by the Behavioral Sciences, Inhalation 
Exposure, Epigenetics, and Elemental Analysis Facilities for researchers within and outside the Center; (3) 
Provide individualized assistance in clinical and Human Subjects research; (4) Develop new technologies to 
advance Center research; and (5) Work with the Community Engagement Core to enhance research 
partnerships with community stakeholders. Regular feedback from Center members and from our Internal and 
External Advisory Committees guides continuous improvements in meeting the needs of Center members and 
our partners."
10848298,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Core-1)
Genetically engineered cell lines and mouse models are critical for elucidating complex biological processes.
The ability to customize the context in which these scientific questions are asked is at an unprecedented level
of detail and technical precision. Essentially, any genetic target can be altered to address protein localization,
protein-protein interaction or structure-function relationships at endogenous levels of expression and
regulation. The Mouse and Cell Modeling Core (Core 1) will create new research materials for the P01 projects
and repurpose multiple, established mouse models to generate novel reagents in the way of primary cell lines.
With CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing tools, Core 1 will modify human cell lines to enable the dissection of
the BRCA network as described in the individual P01 projects. Key genes will be disrupted in breast cancer
and medulloblastoma cell lines and proteins involved in DNA repair and replication stress relief will be modified
to disrupt their interaction domains. This comprehensive approach among the investigators will allow exchange
of results related to each the projects and inform future directions. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and
embryonic stem (ES) cell lines will be generated to study protein localization to sites of DNA damage and
repair efficiency in near wild-type backgrounds, except for the desired mutations. In producing the desired
MEFs, genetically matched controls will be produced concomitantly. Commonly used cell lines may have
uncharacterized defects in DNA repair pathways, while newly generated MEFs and ES cells are near native
state. A unique mouse model will be made by adding to an existing Brca1/Trp53 conditional line a null allele for
a strong predicator of chemoresistance. As Brca1, Trp53 and the new target are all located on the same
chromosome, CRISPR/Cas9 will be used in embryos derived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) to disrupt the gene
without having to do extensive interbreeding to combine the three physically close alleles. Another unique
mouse model will be made by deleting the genomic sequence in Brca1 that encodes the binding region of key
interaction partner. Core 1 draws on expertise in mouse embryo handling, mouse embryonic fibroblast and
embryonic stem cell production, cell line gene editing, evaluation of cell line knock-outs, mouse model creation,
CRISPR/Cas9 project design, complex project management and efficient breeding of existing mouse lines. By
concentrating production of gene edited cell lines in Core 1, research in individual laboratories can be focused
on downstream analyses."
10820136,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Therapeutic irradiation, a commonly used treatment for head and neck cancer patients, irreversibly damages the
salivary glands (SGs). Current therapies aim to alleviate the resulting xerostomia (dry mouth syndrome) but fail
to address the underlying mechanism of dysfunction, thus new strategies for tissue regeneration are needed.
Given that endogenous repair of irradiated SGs is majorly hampered due to the loss of saliva-producing acinar
cells and their progenitors, inducing the ability of the remaining ductal cells to behave as acinar progenitors (i.e.
plasticity) is an attractive repair strategy. Inducing plasticity is a complex process whereby transcription factors
often interact with chromatin modulators, such as Hdac1, to induce downstream gene regulators of progenitor
cell potency. Interestingly, it has been shown that some irradiated ductal cells can spontaneously revert towards
a progenitor-like state to enable acinar differentiation under severe stress conditions, although too few undergo
this transition to fully restore the gland. In order to enhance plasticity, we recently demonstrated that
overexpression of transcription factor Sox10 in non-irradiated ductal cells induces plasticity, allowing acinar
differentiation ex vivo. However, whether this set-up is applicable to irradiated ductal cells is unclear. Based on
preliminary data, we hypothesize that plasticity can be induced in irradiated ductal cells through overexpression
of Sox10, which activates a downstream regulatory network through binding with Hdac1. To prove this
hypothesis, our objectives are to evaluate the binding capacity of Sox10 to Hdac1, as well as the altered
downstream gene network and acinar formation capacity in irradiated cells after inducing a Sox10-mediated
plasticity. Overall, these data will then be used to formulate a new translational therapy in our in vivo radiation-
induced xerostomia animal model to aid in the repair of SGs post-radiation."
10835903,"In this project, we will dissect the roles of class I myosins, molecular motors that bind actin
filaments through their motor domains and plasma membrane through their tail domains, in
actin-mediated cell shape changes. We will test the hypothesis that myosin I motor activity
promotes assembly of branched actin networks at the sites of membrane deformation, including
endocytic vesicles, phagocytic cups, and podosomes. The proposed work will use two model
systems: fission yeast, where myosin I is required for endocytosis, and murine macrophages,
which rely on myosin I for phagocytosis and cell migration. In aim 1, we will determine how
myosin motor activity contributes to endocytic actin patch assembly and internalization in yeast.
We will use the genetically tractable yeast system to express mutant myosin from the
endogenous myosin locus and apply molecule counting techniques, which are well established
in the yeast endocytosis system, to measure the rates of actin assembly. In aim 2, we will test
the role of myosin motor activity in actin and membrane dynamics during phagocytosis and cell
migration. These studies will take advantage of the genetically modified mice lacking class I
myosins that are available in our labs. In aim 3, we will determine how myosin-membrane
interactions are regulated to contribute to myosin functions in actin assembly and immune
response. The proposed work will shed light on the molecular mechanisms driving actin-
dependent membrane deformation."
10832487,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the primary functions of the brain is to calculate the most adaptive action for the organism to make
under a given set of environmental conditions. This process requires learning which features in the
environment predict ethological relevance and subsequently deciding which actions to take, given the probable
outcome of those actions. Hence, neural substrates for reward prediction must interact with those controlling
behavioral output. The neuromodulator dopamine is a critical component of this interaction. Dopaminergic
neurons in the midbrain are excited by rewards not predicted by the current environment. However, when
stimuli reliably predict reward, they decrease activity time locked to the reward and shift to the environmental
predictors themselves. Therefore, dopamine is thought of as a teaching signal that broadcasts stimuli-related
reward predictions. Data from the previous funding cycles showed that endocannabinoids in the ventral
tegmentum sculpt cue-induced surges in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens during reward seeking.
We hypothesized, but never unambiguously demonstrated, that this arises from release of the
endocannabinoid 2AG from dopamine neurons themselves, which lessens their level of inhibition. This
disinhibition mechanism is highly conserved as we found that it occurs during the pursuit of apetitive rewards
but also during the avoidance of punishment. However, the precise excitatory input to the ventral tegmentum
responsible for the on-demand release of 2AG from dopamine neurons is not known. Here, we propose
experiments to further elucidate the role of endocannabinoid signaling in encoding of reward-related cues and
its role in motivation. First, we will assess, using genetic dissection approaches, whether 2AG is indeed
released from dopamine neurons for their activity to conform to reward prediction theories and whether it can
causally influence behavior (aim 1). Next, we will determine which CB1 receptor-expressing afferents to
dopamine neurons in the VTA are responsible for the disinhibitory actions of 2AG during cue-driven reward
seeking. We will provide further mechanistic insight to these questions by studying the excitatory afferents that
give rise to 2AG-dependent dopamine neuron disinhibition during the pursuit of rewards (aim 2). Thus, we will
isolate the different components necessary for endocannabinoid signaling to modulate motivational processes
using a methodologically-integrated approach, as specific genetic control of 2AG production and CB1 receptor
expression will allow explicit tests of current hypotheses of endocannabinoid modulation of motivated behavior.
The present proposal makes use of tools not yet applied to these questions to generate new insights on
therapeutic strategies for the treatment of motivational disorders such as maladaptive drug seeking."
10840875,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is rising. While small molecule targeted inhibitors and immune
checkpoint antibodies have increased long-term survival in advanced-stage cutaneous melanoma, many
patients still do not benefit and regimens are associated with high toxicity. We are studying the determinants
of treatment response and mechanisms of resistance in melanoma. From our studies, we aim to generate pre-
clinical data for new combinations that delay/prevent the onset of acquired resistance while minimizing patient
toxicities in order to improve patient survival and quality of life. Multiple clinical trials have emanated from our
work (NCT03580382, NCT02012231, NCT02683395). Tumor immunogenicity, defined as the ability of the
tumor itself to trigger an anti-tumor adaptive immune response, is one of the most important determinants of
successful anti-cancer therapy. The immunogenicity of a tumor depends on its antigenicity, conferred by neo-
antigens, and also by adjuvant effects triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released
from stressed or dying tumor cells during a process called immunogenic cell death (ICD). We recently
discovered a signaling pathway that allows efficient release of DAMPs from dying cells by switching apoptosis
into a potentially immunogenic form of cell death called pyroptosis. Mechanistically, activation of caspase-3
during apoptosis leads to cleavage of gasdermin E (GSDME), generating a pore-forming GSDME-N fragment.
GSDME-N pores allow release of intracellular DAMPs such as HMGB1, DNA, and ATP. The ability of this
novel pathway to switch apoptosis into pyroptosis suggests that GSDME-induced pyroptosis is likely a key
effector of cancer cell immunogenicity and may determine their successful response to various anti-cancer
therapies. Supporting this hypothesis, our preliminary data revealed that efficient BRAFi + MEKi-induced anti-
tumor immune responses in melanoma cells are dependent, at least in part, on the pyroptotic activity of
GSDME. The goals of this application are to define mechanisms underlying BRAFi + MEKi regulation of
GSDME and pyroptosis in melanoma and to investigate how GSDME-induced pyroptosis alters the effects of
immune checkpoint inhibitors. The standard of care for melanomas is immune checkpoint inhibition, specifically
anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) and anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab). Immune checkpoint inhibitors are
efficacious in some melanoma patients; however, many do not respond. Other patients who initially respond,
ultimately progress. This proposal is designed to utilize targeted therapies to optimize up-front immune
checkpoint inhibitors as well as invigorating the immune system in resistant tumors. Thus, we aim to develop
new therapeutic strategies that will address clinical unmet needs in the melanoma field."
10834061,"Abstract
In the crowded milieu of the membrane, membrane proteins, with other soluble and membrane-associated
proteins, and lipids form a large number of dynamic and transient protein complexes that in turn govern
cellular physiology. There is also mounting evidence that both independent membrane protein-lipid
interactions, as well as bulk biophysical properties of the host membrane often regulate these assemblies.
Hence, to understand how associations between specific membrane proteins help a cell responds to an
external stimulus, we need to study the oligomeric assemblies of the respective proteins directly from the
lipid bilayer environment. This brings us to the primary challenge of studying membrane protein-lipid
interactions. The existing tools to study such interactions lack this critical ability to perform molecular
analysis directly from the bilayer environment. Addressing this challenge, the overarching goal of this
project is to develop a novel experimental platform that enables analysis of MP complexes directly from in
vitro lipid bilayers, which can be customized to a target cellular membrane. To this end, we will combine
lipid vesicle technologies with native mass spectrometry (nativeMS). In Aim 1, taking a set of ten different
standard oligomeric membrane proteins we will develop an experimental method that enables us to
determine their oligomeric states directly from a range of lipid vesicles mimicking different physiological
membranes. We will validate and benchmark our results against the known oligomeric masses of each of
these proteins. This will establish the applicability of our platform to detect a wide range of membrane
proteins from a variety of lipid bilayer environments. In Aim 2, we will develop an experimental strategy that
enables us to directly determine the specifically bound lipid binds and where do they bind. To this end, in
collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific, we will combine ECD fragmentation with lipid vesicle nativeMS
platform. Together, upon successful completion, these two Aims will provide an arsenal of new
technologies to study the oligomeric organization of membrane proteins and lipids directly from a
physiologically relevant lipid bilayer. In Aim 3, we will apply this to a complex biological system to address
an outstanding question in neurobiology; how neurotransmitter filled synaptic vesicles attain their ultrafast
speed of fusion. To this end, we will specifically target the role of synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle
membrane protein which has been linked to various neurological disorders. The experiment proposed can
bring out critical mechanist and structural insight to understand neuronal signal transduction and related
disease-specific impairments. In the long run, impairment of associations between membrane proteins has
been linked to several pathophysiological conditions ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer. We are
confident that the proposed platform will have a transformative role in studying a wide range of biological
processes and associated disease states."
10813733,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) has been utilized for years to avoid implantation of embryos
harboring rare monogenic disease-causing alleles or aneuploidies. However, recent progress in complex trait
genetics, coupled with the technical ability to generate accurate genome-wide genotypes from single-cell input,
has made it possible to genetically screen embryos for common polygenic traits and disease risk. While
popular media has raised the specter of ‘‘designer babies,’’ and private industry has begun to offer services of
dubious merit, little empirical work has been done to quantify the utility of polygenic embryo screening (PES),
examine its ethical implications, and assess stakeholders’ perspectives. Unlike conventional PGT, polygenic
risk scores are intrinsically probabilistic and multifaceted. The inherent ambiguities of PES requires careful
consideration in order for clinicians, policymakers, and the general public to make informed decisions about the
potential consequences of implementing polygenic embryo screening. Moreover, although research
momentum for polygenic risk scores has grown exponentially in the last few years, there is almost no
independent, empirical data on either: 1) the potential ability of PES to produce desired outcomes under
various real-world scenarios; or 2) the perspectives and attitudes of front-line clinicians in the potential clinical
application of polygenic risk scores, especially in the prenatal context.
 In order to build an initial framework for the consideration of the ethical, legal, and social implications
(ELSI) of PES, it is necessary to establish two sets of empirical parameters: first, the statistical properties that
will shape the potential application of polygenic risk scores in the prenatal setting; and second, the attitudes
and perspectives of clinicians who would be at the front lines of administering PES, including genetic
counselors, reproductive endocrinologists, and obstetricians. The proposed study therefore aims to quantify
the range of realistic outcomes of PES in the context of disease risk reduction under varying conditions, using
a combination of simulated and real data. We also aim to understand the perspectives of clinicians who would
potentially deliver PES, using both in-depth interviews and a large-scale survey of reproductive clinicians and
geneticists. In the proposed research project, these two aims will be interdigitated and mutually informative;
statistical investigation will be guided by concerns and questions posed by stakeholders, and stakeholder
interviews and surveys will be shaped by the statistical and methodological understanding obtained from our
analyses. On the basis of our results, we will perform ethical analysis of this rapidly evolving technology."

 Chromatin remodelers are ATP-dependent DNA translocases that catalyze disassembly, reassembly, and
repositioning of nucleosomes throughout eukaryotic genomes. As evidenced from multiple types of cancer and
developmental disorders associated with remodeler mutations, chromatin remodeling is essential for normal
growth and development. This proposal aims to address core mechanistic questions of remodeler action and
regulation, using the Chd1 chromatin remodeler as a model system. Recent studies revealed that chromatin
remodelers shift nucleosomes using a twist defect mechanism. In this process, remodelers couple distinct
nucleotide-dependent conformations of the ATPase motor to create and then eliminate DNA distortions (twist
defects) that stimulate the nucleosome to transiently absorb and then release an extra bp at the remodeler
binding site. Currently, it is unknown how remodelers create twist defects. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to
identify key residues and elements of Chd1 necessary for distorting DNA into twist defects, which should allow
for a mechanistic understanding of this central process. Another question addressed by this proposal is how
remodeler ATPases are regulated. For Chd1, nucleosome sliding activity is coupled to DNA outside the
nucleosome, with a requirement for flanking DNA on the “entry” side and preference for little or no DNA on the
“exit” side. For Chd1, flanking DNA controls sliding activity through a DNA-binding domain that is coupled to
autoinhibitory elements. A central question addressed by Aim 2 of this proposal is how stability and interactions
of autoinhibitory elements are controlled by distinct domain arrangements on the nucleosome. Experiments are
designed to reveal kinetic transitions of remodeler rearrangements on the nucleosome. Finally, a major
unanswered question is how two remodelers bound to the same nucleosome affect activity of each other. Chd1
has been shown to bind to nucleosomes in a 2:1 ratio, with the DNA-binding domain interacting in trans with
the chromo-ATPase, yet the significance of these interactions is unknown. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that two
opposing remodelers bound to the same nucleosome antagonize each other. Together, these studies will
provide new mechanistic insights into how remodelers alter nucleosome structure, autoregulate action of their
central ATPase motor, and coordinate and potentially control other remodelers on the nucleosome."

Megakaryocyte Maturation
Abstract
Thrombocytopenia is a major clinical problem encountered in multiple conditions, and severe
thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <50 x 10^9/L) can lead to life threatening bleeding. Current treatment
options have severe side effects, are in limited supply, involve blood products, and the platelet response
typically takes up to 12 days. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new thrombopoietic agents that
increase platelet counts for patients. In many inflammatory conditions platelet counts rise, resulting in
thrombocytosis, but what initiates this platelet up-regulation is not well understood. Our lab uses inflammation
as a model of exacerbated thrombopoiesis that results in differences in platelet quality and quantity in order to
1) gain a better understanding of the basic biology of megakaryocyte (MK) maturation their production of
platelets, 2) identify thrombopoietin (TPO) independent pathways of MK maturation, and 3) determine ways to
reduce platelet-related morbidity and mortality in inflammation. We have discovered a novel regulator of MK
maturation during inflammation: platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) in the bone marrow. Our
preliminary data indicate that platelets package and shed MVs in an agonist-specific mechanism dependent on
Rho GTPase signaling; the mechanism of Rho-mediated regulation of PEV formation and packaging will be
explored in Aim 1. We also found that PEVs enter the bone marrow from the plasma, and bind to and are
endocytosed by MKs both in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will examine how platelet-derived MVs interact with
MKs. Specifically, we will determine the mechanisms by which they bind to and are internalized by MKs and
how their cargo transferred. In inflammatory conditions such as SLE, ongoing platelet activation increases
levels of circulating PEVs. These PEVs deliver disease-related changes from the plasma milieu directly to MKs
in the bone marrow, reprogramming the MKs to make more pathogenic platelets. In Aim 3, we will identify the
PEV factors that alter MK gene expression and platelet content in SLE. Successful completion of the proposed
experiments will, for the first time, provide a detailed roadmap of how PEVs alter the hematopoietic
environment in the setting of inflammatory disease. The insights gained may identify novel therapeutic targets
that (i) alter PEV poduction independent of platelet activation (Aim 1), (ii) hijack the PEV/MK interaction to alter
MK maturation (Aim 2), and (iii) inhibit pathologic MK reprogramming during SLE and other inflammatory
diseases (Aim 3)."

Axon regeneration is a fundamental and conserved property of nervous systems. But axon
regeneration often fails to restore function after nerve injury. Thus, a key question in the field is
to discover what determines the capacity of injured neurons to rebuild functional circuits. This
proposal investigates new mechanisms that function in the injured neuron and that help
determine whether or not effective regeneration occurs. The long-term goal is to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the cellular functions that link neuronal injury to successful
functional regeneration. The specific goal of this project is to analyze the process of synapse
regeneration. The project uses a combination of in vivo approaches aimed at understanding
how synapse regeneration works, why it fails to restore normal function, and how it can be
improved. Completion of these Aims will describe fundamental cellular mechanisms that
mediate functional axon regeneration after nerve injury."

The goal of this renewal application is to continue our K12 training program for early career pediatricians with
both the aptitude and passion to become the next generation of basic and translational physician scientists. The
results of our first funding cycle have been excellent, and lessons learned are incorporated to further strengthen
the program. The overarching theme for the program is elucidation of the molecular and cellular pathogenesis
of childhood diseases, leading to identification of therapeutic targets. Our focus is career development in the
following areas where Vanderbilt has internationally recognized programs of discovery combined with a record
of excellence in research mentorship: 1) Lung Disease and Development, 2) Heart Disease and Development;
3) Obesity and Metabolism (including diabetes) 4) Neurological Disorders; 5) Cancer Biology, 6) Genetics and
Genomic Medicine, and 7) Infectious Diseases, including emerging pathogens. The program offers an integrated
pediatric department and medical school training program for four pediatric K12 scholars to receive up to three
years of support that includes intense scientific mentorship and personalized career development. The scholars
will have access to a cadre of well-established faculty including 33 carefully selected senior investigators, all with
sustained NIH funding coupled with a successful track record of mentoring early career scholars. Also, we have
selected 8 pediatric ‘next generation mentors’, with K or early R01 funding that will be well positioned for full
mentorship in the future. The Department of Pediatrics is fully integrated into the Vanderbilt School of Medicine
and health system, a leading NIH funded academic medical center. All departments, hospitals, research
laboratories and core facilities reside on a single campus offering an integrated research environment for
scholars. Through multiple training grants, there is a strong pipeline of future K12 scholars. Program leadership
will also conduct a national search to identify a group of K12 scholars, including underrepresented minorities,
that will thrive in this collaborative environment. Each scholar will have an individualized training program
developed by the PI and training directors in collaboration with a multidisciplinary mentorship team and will be
supported by a broad array of institutional and departmental resources. The primary focus for each scholar will
be their mentored research project, but they will have opportunities to participate in an array of training
opportunities to support their research and career development goals. To avoid distraction from research time,
we will carefully define required activities from optional program opportunities. Required elements include weekly
attendance at lab meetings and with their primary mentor, monthly group meetings with program leaders, six-
monthly scholar oversight committee meetings, and annual evaluations of scholars and program. They will also
have confidential face-to-face meetings with two outside advisors (Drs. Arnold Strauss and George Dover).
These plans provide an optimal environment for developing the next generation of pediatric physician scientists."

 One million children develop TB annually; but current TB diagnostics exhibit poor performance in children,
and the vast majority (96%) of the 205,000 children who die of TB-related causes each year do not receive
treatment. Such children often present with non-specific symptoms and paucibacillary TB – particularly those
co-infected with HIV – and are not diagnosed, and may then progress to disseminated or extrapulmonary TB
cases that can rapidly progress in the absence of appropriate treatment. In young children, difficulty obtaining
sputum samples used by most front-line TB diagnostics reduces the ability to accurately diagnose TB and
monitor its response to treatment. Thus, non-sputum-based diagnostics are urgently needed to address this
problem, but current versions of such assays either demonstrate poor sensitivity for active TB or cannot
differentiate active disease from latent TB infection or accurately monitor treatment responses.
 We have reported that detection of virulence factors secreted by Mycobacterial tuberculosis (Mtb) in serum
can diagnose all forms of TB in children (pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB), including paucibacillary and HIV-
associated TB cases. We have recently shown that multiplex detection of HIV- and Mtb-derived protiens in serum
can sensitively diagnose HIV and TB in young children, and simultaneously monitor their response to HIV and
TB treatment. This is a critical issue for those at highest risk for mortality; very young children who may be
exposed and/or infected with both pathogens while breastfeeding, during the first two years of life. Based on our
success in identifying pathogen-specific peptide biomarkers and developing corresponding diagnostic assays,
we propose to develop a multiplex HIV and TB assay for improved detection and monitoring of HIV viral load
and all stages of TB, from early infection to active TB disease, in young children suspected HIV and TB infections
or HIV/TB co-infections. We propose to achieve this goal through the pursuit of three interlinked specific aims
where we will: 1) establish an assay for multiplex quantification of serum levels of TB-derived factors associated
with each stage of TB development, from early infection to active TB disease in an infant non-human primate TB
model that closely recapitulates the pathology of HIV and TB infection and co-infection; 2) develop a predictive
model based on correlations between TB stage markers, immune responses and TB pathology in this disease
model; and 3) conduct a multi-center validation of this multiplex assay to diagnose HIV infection and latent TB
infections and early and active TB disease in HIV-exposed pediatric cohorts with carefully annotated clinical,
radiological and bacteriological data. Employing a non-human primate model of HIV/TB co-infection and
quantitative proteomics will allow us to identify TB-associated changes corresponding to symptom development
and immune changes associated with disease progression that could not feasibly be detected using human
cohorts. The comprehensive evaluation of our assay in multiple well-characterized pediatric cohorts will facillitate
the rapid translation of these biomarkers into practice and the development of our portable device-based assay."
10863829,"Project Summary
Twenty-five percent of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) undergo intervention in the first year of life,
often requiring surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). CPB and related techniques including deep
hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) are necessary but contribute to poor postoperative physiology. Mortality
for high risk surgeries remains >10%. Major complications occur in 30% of these complex surgeries and are
key drivers of hospital length of stay (LOS) and costs. Novel diagnostic, mechanistic, and therapeutic
approaches are critically needed to impact this burden on our infants, families, and healthcare system.
Metabolites are the small-molecule end products of the genome that collectively determine minute-to-minute
cellular physiology. Individual metabolites (e.g. lactate) are commonly used in postoperative management, but
the interrelated metabolomic changes induced by infant cardiac surgery remain poorly understood. Recently,
the metabolic profile of infants undergoing CPB was shown to shift markedly during the first 24hrs
postoperatively and metabolites from two related pathways (kynurenine and nicotinamide metabolism) were
associated with mortality and ICU LOS. Evolution of the postoperative metabolic profile beyond 24hrs and
comprehensive changes in circulating/tissue kynurenine and nicotinamide metabolites are unknown.
Overall Hypothesis: Infant cardiac surgery with CPB induces pathologic changes in the circulating metabolome
across multiple key metabolic pathways. These changes directly impact postoperative outcomes and organ
injury through a combination of beneficial metabolite depletion and pathologic metabolite production.
Proposal: The study will use a combined clinical and translational approach. The clinical arm will consist of a
prospective cohort study of infants undergoing CPB, with serial targeted metabolic profiling and pathway
mapping through 72hrs postoperatively. The complementary translational arm will consist of a piglet model of
CPB/DHCA to evaluate and modulate organ-specific flux through kynurenine and nicotinamide metabolism.
Specific Aim 1: Validate the association of the 24hr postoperative metabolic profile with the combined outcome
of death, cardiac arrest, or mechanical circulatory support and determine the evolution of this pathologic
metabolic profile through 72hrs postoperatively.
Specific Aim 2: Perform quantitative mapping of the kynurenine and nicotinamide metabolic pathways in order
to a) quantify individual metabolite abnormalities, b) identify contributing changes in pathway enzymes, and c)
determine the association of specific pathway abnormalities with postoperative outcomes.
Specific Aim 3: In a piglet model of CPB with DHCA, quantify circulating and organ-specific kynurenine and
nicotinamide pathway metabolites and determine the effects of pathway blockade on development of
postoperative acute organ injury using systemic indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase inhibition."

Epithelial cancers are common malignancies that account for 80 to 90 percent of human cancers.
Despite breakthroughs in chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, they generally
are incurable in advanced stages. Cell therapy has shown remarkable efficacy in certain
advanced stage hematologic cancers, but application of the approach to epithelial cancers has
been more difficult. The short-term goal of this project is to elucidate principles of cell therapy in
epithelial cancers using human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers as a disease model.
The long-term goal of this project is to discover and develop cellular therapy for HPV-associated
cancers and other common malignancies. Research in the Si2 phase demonstrated that tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes can cause durable, complete tumor responses in HPV-associated
cancers; genetically engineered T cells targeting an HPV oncoprotein can induce robust tumor
regression in HPV-associated cancers – including immune checkpoint blockade resistant tumors;
and tumor-intrinsic genetic defects in antigen processing machinery (APM) and interferon (IFN)
response pathways control resistance to engineered TCR-T cell therapy.
Research in the R00 phase will build on the Si2 findings with the goals to 1) elucidate in HPV-
associated cancers a multidimensional picture of tumor-intrinsic immune related genetic
resistance (IRGR) and 2) investigate the impact of cell therapy and immune pressure on IRGR
and of IRGR on tumor response to cell therapy. HPV-associated cancers will be profiled for
alterations in genes with defined function in tumor recognition and killing by T cells. In addition,
exploratory analyses will be conducted to identify candidate immune evasion genes that are
altered at frequencies greater than expected or that drive clonal evolution based on spatial clonal
architecture mapping. The impact of cell therapy on IRGR and vice versa will be investigated by
study of HPV-associated cancers from patients treated with tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy
and engineered TCR-T cell therapy. The longitudinal impact of immune pressure on IRGR will be
investigated by comparing primary versus metastatic tumors and by analyzing serial intra-patient,
metachronous tumor resections. This research will provide an integrated understanding of the
reciprocal effects of immune response and IRGR in HPV-associated cancers. The work is critical
to understanding immune editing and tumor resistance in the context of cell therapy and is
necessary to guide the discovery of predictive biomarkers and the rational design of next-
generation treatment strategies."
10814235,"Abstract
 Laparoscopic or “minimally invasive” procedures are frequently performed in surgery today. It provides
numerous clinical benefits to patients and has become the gold standard surgical procedure for many
intraabdominal and thoracic procedures. Existing laparoscopes provide visualization of the operative field
through a video camera inserted into the patient’s abdomen. It occupies a dedicated laparoscopic port and
requires a camera operator to maneuver and navigate the camera for visualization. The field of view is narrow
and the depth of the scene is difficult to infer. To facilitate surgery, the camera needs to be in proximity to the
operative field, making it prone to smudging, fogging, and splatter that may obscure visualization and require
cleaning. The position of the camera may also interferes with the operating surgical instruments.
 To address these deficiencies associated with current laparoscopic visualization, in this project, we will
develop a paradigm-shift, integrated, panoramic, flexible, immersive 3D laparoscopic visualization system
called EasyVis that could significantly improve the efficiency of laparoscopic surgery. EasyVis directly
integrates multiple microcameras and their peripherals including light sources and miniaturized projectors with
the surgical ports. It provides an uninterrupted, intra-abdominal, flexible, and immersive 3D view from arbitrary
virtual viewpoints and viewing angles, and close-up 3D visualization of any specific area, all under direct,
hands-free, easy and full control of the operating surgeon through voice commands, eliminating the need of
camera navigation. EasyVis does not occupy any extra surgical port and solves the problems associated with
smudging, fogging and splatter, and interference with and occlusion of instruments. With EasyVis, the surgeon
is provided with enhanced visualization (better quality, easy control) and less interruption due to laparoscope
manipulation during the operation.
 Three specific aims will be pursued. First, we will develop an imaging system including heterogeneous
microcamera arrays, light sources, and miniature projectors. This imaging system provides flexibly selectable
viewpoints and viewing angles with auto-focus and zooming capabilities and real-time scene stabilization. A
system that can deploy the imaging system through a surgical port will also be developed. Second, we will
develop algorithms to achieve flexible global and local views, and immersive, any-view 3D visualization, all
through a human-computer interface worn by the operating surgeon. Third, we will validate our laparoscopic
visualization system with inanimate and animal models."
10832066,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity-induced lipotoxicity is the primary pathophysiological defect that predisposes to non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD). Because current management options remain limited, identification of new regulatory
mechanisms that govern the maladaptive response to overnutrition will serve to identify novel opportunities for
pharmacologic intervention. Acyl-CoA thioesterases (Acots) control the cellular utilization of fatty acids by
hydrolyzing acyl-CoA into non-esterified fatty acids. Our long-term goal is to define how aberrant Acot activity
can be leveraged for therapeutic purposes. The objective of this research is to determine the mechanisms by
which Acot9-mediated hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA culminates in metabolic disease. Our preliminary data indicates
that Acot9 locates to the inner membrane (IM) of the mitochondria in the liver where it traffics acetyl-CoA
towards the citric acid (TCA) cycle. This results in increased hepatic glucose production (HGP) and de novo
lipogenesis (DNL) as well as lipotoxicity as evidenced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hepatic insulin
resistance. In addition to TCA cycle, Acot9 increased acetyl-CoA supply for lysine acetylation of proteins (AcK)
by controlling acetyl-CoA bioavailability and by inhibiting the deacetylase sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), which reduces ROS
by inhibiting AcK. In contrast to liver, in thermogenic adipose tissue (BAT), cold-induced translocation of Acot9
from IM into mitochondrial matrix suppressed thermogenesis by trafficking acetyl-CoA away from TCA cycle.
Our central hypothesis is that obesity-induced activation of Acot9 impairs nutrient homeostasis by promoting
lipotoxicity in the liver and by limiting thermogenesis in BAT. The rationale is that the mechanisms of acetyl-
CoA trafficking by Acot9 will reveal novel targets for the prevention of lipotoxicity and its pathophysiological
consequences. The central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To identify the molecular
mechanisms by which hepatic Acot9 promotes hepatic lipotoxicity; 2) To elucidate the mechanisms by which
Acot9 in BAT limits thermogenesis; and 3) To determine the mechanisms by which Acot9 controls AcK and
ROS in the liver. In Aim 1, the mechanisms of Acot9-induced lipotoxicity, HGP and DNL will be elucidated in
mice with liver-specific ablation of Acot9 (Acot9LKO) using lipidomics and metabolomics. Impact on insulin
signaling and lipotoxic pathways will be determined in mice and primary hepatocytes. Aim 2 will use mice with
BAT-specific ablation of Acot9 for the indirect calorimetry measurements in climate-controlled cages. Clamp,
tissue histology and metabolomics will assess the metabolic function of Acot9 in BAT. Cultured brown
adipocytes and recombinant Acot9 will be used to determine the mechanism of Acot9 translocation into
mitochondrial matrix. Aim 3 will use Acot9LKO/Sirt3–/– double knockout mice to determine the role of Sirt3 in
Acot9-mediated regulation of AcK and ROS in the liver. Overall, this proposal will elucidate new mechanisms
of thioesterase-mediated control of acetyl-CoA utilization. This is significant because acetyl-CoA is the
common breakdown end-product of nearly all dietary lipids and sugars. These studies are expected to
establish Acot9 as a tractable target for the management of NAFLD."
10833649,"Significant progress in detection and treatment has reduced cancer mortality rates; however, with over 1.7 million
new cases and 600,000 deaths from cancer reported in 2019, it remains a major health concern that is predicted
to surpass cardiovascular disease as the major cause of death in the US. by 2020. The growing segment of the
population that is over 65 years of age and at elevated risk for cancer adds to this disease burden. These data
highlight the need for new approaches to cancer treatment and its management in cancer survivors who are
projected to exceed 20 million by 2026. Advances in our understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms
that are disrupted in human cancers to promote oncogenesis have progressed at an unparalleled rate and
provide a seedbed for the novel therapeutic interventions required to fill this need. The current challenge is to
close this widening gap between laboratory discoveries and their clinical applications in the fight against cancer.
Indeed, creating a streamlined translational pipeline is a priority of the Cancer Moonshot Initiative. Despite these
unprecedented opportunities to impact patient outcomes, there is a shortage of young scientists and clinicians
with a strong background in cancer biology and the demand for oncologists is predicted to outpace the supply of
clinicians in this field by 2025. Thus, inspiring and training the next generation of cancer researchers and
oncologists is central to accelerating the translation of research breakthroughs into new diagnostics and
therapeutics. The Nathan Schnaper Intern Program in Translational Research (NISP) at the University of
Maryland Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center seeks to achieve this goal through three specific aims:
1) Recruit talented and diverse cohorts of undergraduate interns with an interest in cancer research and/or
clinical oncology from institutions across the US. 2) Integrate mentored research, educational modules and
clinical exposure to provide interns with hands-on experience in translational cancer research, excite them about
careers in this field and foster their success on this path. 3) Evaluate program outcomes and disseminate this
information to identify and share best practices, track the progress of intern alumni as a key metric of program
success and develop capacity-building partnerships. The NSIP has a strong history of training interns who make
seminal contributions to cancer biology. The current proposal builds upon this history, and successes of the first
funding period, by augmenting a robust summer curriculum with innovative population science components. New
modules in cancer epidemiology, disparities, and survivorship provide interns with a broader perspective of
cancer research, care and career opportunities. Furthermore, as part of an expanded cancer education pipeline
that is now comprised of nine programs, NSIP interns benefit from near peer networking through joint forums
that inform and impact their educational and career path decisions. Incorporation of innovative new modules with
established NSIP components in the next funding period will fulfill the research, education, training and workforce
development goals of the Cancer Research Education Grants Program that are integral to the NCI mission."

10831384,"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a large surface lined by a single layer epithelium which is exposed
to trillions of microbes and innocuous substances from the diet. The largest collection of immune
cells in the body underlies this single layer epithelium and monitors the luminal contents to
maintain tolerance to dietary and commensal antigens in the steady-state while retaining the
ability to rapidly induce immunity to pathogens during infection. While great progress has been
made in elucidating the role(s) of specific immune cell subsets, cytokines, and other factors
promoting tolerance or immunity, the processes intrinsic to the gut that enable the immune system
to switch from an overwhelmingly tolerogenic tone in the steady-state to inflammatory responses
during infection remains a gap in our understanding. Recently, we have uncovered that inhibiting
goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs) in the small intestine (SI) rapidly shifts the
immunologic tone away from tolerance and promotes the rapid induction of inflammatory Th17
responses in the absence of infection or injury. We hypothesize that the inhibition of GAPs is a
physiologic response to enteric infection, which in and of itself, promotes the generation of Th17
cells and inflammatory cytokines and shifts the tone of the immune system away from tolerance
toward immunity. By studying this process in the absence of enteric infection or injury we can
disentangle contributions of the pathogen and injury to the inflammatory response from intrinsic
properties of the gut ecosystem promoting the switch from a tolerogenic to pro-inflammatory state.
Understanding intrinsic properties of the gut that allows the rapid generation of protective
responses could provide new approaches to treat enteric infections and provide insight into the
pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases of the gut. We hypothesize that when SI GAPs
are inhibited, other pathways take over driving the development and/or expansion of Th17 cells
specific for dietary, microbial, and/or self antigens, which shifts the tone of the immune system to
provide enhanced protection during enteric infection and/or injury. To explore this hypothesis we
propose the following specific aims: In aim 1 we will identify the early events resulting in Th17
expansion following SI GAP inhibition, in aim 2 we will define the origins and specificities of the
Th17 cells that expand when SI GAPs are inhibited in aim 3 we will determine if the inhibition of
SI GAPs is protective in models of enteric infection and whether inappropriate inhibition of SI
GAPs potentiates intestinal inflammatory disease."

This proposal is a competitive renewal application for a multidisciplinary training program in basic and
translational research in muscle cell biology at UCLA from a group of highly engaged faculty mentors. The
program in Muscle Cell Biology, Pathophysiology, and Therapeutics is focused on bridged training in the fields
of muscle and numerous complementary fields and is the sole UCLA training program integrating fundamental
laboratory-based research in muscle relevant fields with preclinical and clinical applications. The Muscle
Research Center @UCLA is the hub of muscle focused research and educational activities. For many years, the
muscle research community at UCLA has been galvanized by funding from two major center grants including
the NIH P30 center grant and the NIH U54 Senator Paul D. Wellstone Center of Excellence grant that have been
vital to the recruitment of new faculty members from different fields to apply their expertise to skeletal muscle
diseases. Our trainees are further developed through activities of a top scoring, NIH-funded Clinical Science
Translational Institute (CTSI). A multitude of unique, interactive, and highly integrated activities in muscle
research serve as an outstanding resource for our trainees. The training program emphasizes training in the
cellular, molecular, and genetic mechanisms of basic muscle function and disease. At both the pre- and
postdoctoral levels, the Muscle Cell Biology, Pathophysiology, and Therapeutics main goals are to: 1) identify
and support outstanding trainees with a high level of interest and focus in muscle cell biology research, 2) train
scientists to conduct cutting-edge research in fundamental and clinical muscle biology, 3) provide trainees with
a solid background in the biological sciences with an emphasis in fundamental physiology, immunology,
biochemistry, biology, genetics, and now also stem cell biology and genomics, 4) facilitate career development
by helping trainees obtain extramural support, and by guiding trainees in obtaining positions in academia and
industry and other areas that suit their interests and skills, 5) introduce novel and significant projects for which
beneficial outcomes will be derived, 6) acquaint trainees with state-of-the-art research through the training grant-
supported fundamental and muscle relevant seminar series and associated journal clubs, and 7) provide trainees
with regular opportunities to present their own research in seminar form and receive critical feedback from the
training grant faculty and scientific community beyond UCLA at muscle and muscular dystrophy-related national
and international meetings, and 8) implement assessments as part of a larger campus effort to develop tools for
T32 training programs. UCLA has become a major site for preclinical and clinical trials in muscle disorders, using
a variety of innovative approaches. The Neuromuscular Program at UCLA in partnership with the Center for
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (CDMD) at UCLA has supported over twenty clinical trials in neuromuscular

10838603,"Copper (Cu) is an essential nutrient that plays vital roles in oxygen transport and utilization. Copper functions directly in the consumption of oxygen via oxidative phosphorylation and is required for the transport of iron which is a vital for oxygen transport within hemoglobin. Despite the importance of copper in oxygen metabolism, little is known regarding the effects of reduced oxygen levels (hypoxia) on copper homeostasis. Hypoxia is a physiological stress that contributes to the pathology of many common diseases, thus the mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to hypoxia is of fundamental importance to human health. Using an innovative CRISPR-based knockout screen for novel regulators of copper homeostasis, mutations in the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene were found to stimulate the expression of ATP7B, a copper transporter primarily expressed in hepatocytes. VHL is a master regulator of oxygen sensing and we demonstrate that ATP7B expression is strongly induced by hypoxia in cultured cells and in the liver of mice. ATP7B is essential for inserting copper into the ceruloplasmin, a ferroxidase with known roles in iron export into the plasma. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that ATP7B is required for hypoxia-induced erythropoiesis through its ability to facilitate ceruloplasmin-mediated iron export into the plasma. Mutations in the ATP7B gene are known to cause Wilson disease, a lethal disorder of hepatic copper overload. We demonstrate that hypoxia induces hepatic expression of an alternative copper transporter, ATP7A, which is a functional homologue of ATP7B. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that hypoxia-induced ATP7A can attenuate hepatic copper overload and liver pathology in the ATP7B-/- mouse model of Wilson disease. To increase the translational potential of our studies, the therapeutic efficacy of a clinically approved hypoxia-mimetic drug Roxadustat will also be tested in ATP7B-/- mice to address its potential for repurposing as a novel treatment for Wilson disease. Finally, based on the demonstrated success of our knockout screen, we will perform an innovative CRISPR- based gene activation screen for novel regulators of copper homeostasis. To test these hypotheses, our proposal will 1) investigate the roles of copper in adaptive responses to hypoxia; 2) test the therapeutic potential of hypoxia in animal models of Wilson disease and 3) identify novel components of mammalian copper homeostasis using an innovative gene activation screen."

The presence of a reservoir of cells harbouring integrated, replication-competent virus that persists under long-
term, fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the inability of the host immune responses to control the
initial events of viral replication that follow ART interruption are critical barriers to curing HIV infection. Thus,
novel therapeutic strategies to remove these barriers are critically needed. The overarching hypotheses of
ERASE HIV are: (i) decreased and/or dysfunctional CD8+ T and NK cell antiviral functions, combined with the
recently-described CD8+ T-cell-mediated transcriptional silencing of HIV, favour HIV persistence under ART and
prevent the control of viremia if ART is stopped; and (ii) novel approaches to elicit effective CD8+ T-cell, NK cell,
and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) functions while inhibiting the CD8+ T-cell-mediated virus
silencing will promote remission and/or eradication of HIV. The overarching goal of ERASE HIV is to identify
novel mechanisms of HIV persistence and to test them in the most relevant pre-clinical animal models through
mechanistically-oriented, community-supported therapeutic strategies that can be ultimately translated to cure
HIV infection in humans. ERASE HIV includes three highly integrated Research Foci (RFs). RF1 is aimed at
identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the two distinct antiviral activities of CD8+ T-cells:
the MHC-restricted, Ag-specific response that directly eliminates virus-infected cells, and the non-MHC
restricted, non-cytolytic silencing of HIV transcription. As such, RF1 will provide the conceptual basis for the
interventions tested in RF2 and RF3. RF2 will use animal models of ART-treated HIV infection to (i) restore CD8+
T and NK cell function with a combined α-IL-10 and IL-15 superagonist (N-803) strategy; (ii) target rebounding
virus by using a CD4-mimetic compound (CD4mc) to enhance antibody recognition of cells expressing HIV Env
and their elimination via ADCC; and (iii) determine if improving CD8 T and NK cell function via α-IL-10 and N-
803 synergizes with CD4mc to clear infected cells. RF3 will determine if suppression of the latency-promoting
activity of CD8+ T-cells, coupled with N-803 and interventions to promote apoptosis (Bcl-2 inhibitors) or immune-
mediated removal (CD4mc) of cells that have reactivated virus, will reduce the reservoir size. In all, we will exploit
the synergy between the mechanistic data generated in RF1 and the in vivo interventions in RF2 and RF3 to
validate a strategy that targets both HIV persistence during ART and HIV recrudescence after ART interruption.
ERASE HIV is supported by experts in HIV advocacy (SisterLove); recognition and killing of HIV Env-expressing
cells (Finzi/Sodroski); T and NK cell biology (Sekaly/Ribeiro/Deleage/Parsons); reservoir assays and latency
models (Kulpa/Jones/Litchterfeld/Howell); pre-clinical animal studies (Paiardini/Silvestri/Garcia/Saez-
Cirion/Keele/Kumar); mathematical modelling (Davenport); and therapeutics development (Merck and
ImmunityBio) for HIV cure. We believe that the proposed mechanistically-oriented pre-clinical work will
inform strategies that can be translated in clinical trials to achieve prolonged viral remission in PWH."

Individuals with damage to the cerebellum exhibit debilitating deficits in motor coordination, characterized by
oscillatory movements around an endpoint. The anterior interposed nucleus (IntA) is one of the main output
structures from the cerebellum, with inactivation of IntA resulting in dysmetria and an instability of reaching
movements. Recent findings from the lab have revealed the role of IntA as a controller of reach endpoints,
facilitating precise limb movements through adaptive scaling of firing rate. While considerable progress has
been made in understanding the role of the cerebellum in motor control, many questions remain concerning
the signals encoded within IntA neurons during limb movement and how they contribute to the production of
coordinated movements. Investigating the firing rate code of IntA neurons during complex motor tasks will help
to elucidate the role of the cerebellum in anticipatory control and motor learning. To address this gap in
knowledge, this proposal utilizes novel behavioral paradigms for skilled reaching in mice, cell type specific in
vivo recordings during behavior, and causal optogenetic manipulations of cerebellar output. I will first
determine how IntA activity is modulated to ensure endpoint precision to different targets. To do so, I will
examine IntA neural dynamics, both in magnitude and timing, and their relationship to key kinematic
parameters of reach precision. Secondly, I will test whether the anticipatory control signals of IntA can adapt to
account for reach perturbations. Spanning circuit and behavioral levels, this proposal aims to understand the
role of cerebellar output in anticipatory motor control for coordinated movement.

10773049,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Schizophrenia is a debilitating neuropsychiatric condition with a strong genetic component but poorly
understood biological mechanisms. The strongest signal from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
schizophrenia lies in the major histocompatibility complex locus and is in part driven by copy number
variation in the complement component 4 (C4) gene, an important mediator in the complement cascade.
Furthermore, cross-disorder studies implicate shared genetic risk in schizophrenia and autoimmune
disorders, suggesting a potential immunogenetic role in pathogenesis. Schizophrenia has been linked to
increased levels of peripheral inflammation, and immune biomarkers predict worse outcomes in patients
with the disorder. However, it is unclear whether inflammation is a causal factor or a consequence of the
disease process, and to what extent immune-regulating genes play a role. This work will investigate the
joint role of immune biomarkers and genetics in schizophrenia in a large biobank linked to electronic health
records (EHRs). First, a repository of EHRs with longitudinal clinical laboratory data will be used to
examine the temporal relationship between immune biomarker levels and schizophrenia diagnoses. Within
schizophrenia spectrum patients, these biomarker levels will be assessed for their ability to predict specific
clinical outcomes. Second, longitudinal cohorts paralleling those proposed in Aim 1 will be constructed but
incorporating whole-genome genotyping data from a subset of ~90,000 individuals that are a part of the
BioVU, VUMC’s biorepository resource. Genetic predictors of immune biomarkers will be included in these
models and evaluated for their relative contributions to schizophrenia risk and their ability to predict clinical
outcomes. Mediation analyses will then be conducted to investigate causal pathways linking C4 CNV and
immune biomarker alterations in schizophrenia in BioVU. These analyses will be replicated and meta-
analyzed in additional well-powered EHR-linked biobanks from the Million Veteran Program and All of Us
research program. The proposed studies will elucidate the poorly understood relationships between
immune-regulating genetic risk factors, immune biomarkers, and clinical heterogeneity in schizophrenia
spectrum disorders. Understanding these relationships will yield mechanistic insights and uncover
potentially clinically useful biomarkers of schizophrenia disease course."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. A common feature
in AMD is the early damage of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of cells between photoreceptors
and choroid. RPE controls nutrient transport from choroid blood supply to the outer retina and multiple lines
of evidence show that the altered metabolism in RPE is the underlying mechanism for AMD. The long-term
goal of this project is to identify key metabolic features of RPE and the roles that they play in AMD.
We recently found that besides glucose, RPE preferentially uses proline, an amino acid, to fuel its metabolism.
Mutations of enzymes in proline metabolism in humans could cause chorioretinal atrophy or retinal
degeneration. The observation that a proline transporter is highly enriched in RPE but not in photoreceptors,
further supporting our finding. The proline transporter is a novel risk gene linked to AMD. In our preliminary
data, we show that knockout of the proline transporter blocks proine utilization and impairs visual function.
The objective of this proposal is to study proline metabolism in RPE and its role in retinal degeneration. We
plan to rigorously investigate the role of proline in healthy and diseased RPE using advanced tracer
methodology, mass spectrometry, in vivo infusion, live imaging, and proline transporter knockout mouse
models.
The outcome of this research will be to establish a conceptual framework for RPE metabolism that describes
how RPE uses nutrients to maintain metabolic homeostasis with the outer retina. This new knowledge will
provide the basis for understanding the mechanisms of AMD and lay the foundation for developing new
treatments."

Atherosclerotic disease is characterized by intimal vascular calcification, which is an
independent and potent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in coronary artery disease, stroke,
and aortic pathologies. Vascular calcification is an active cell-mediated process that involves the
phenotypic switch of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from contractile to osteogenic cells.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving vascular calcification is critical for developing
targeted therapies. In our lab, we have identified novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
in the arylsulfatase E (ARSE) locus on the X chromosome that are associated with coronary
artery calcification. Our preliminary data demonstrate that adenovirus-mediated overexpression
of ARSE in VSMCs leads to increased calcification and that conversely, reduced expression of
ARSE with siRNA prevents calcification of VSMCs. We have identified SULF1, a protein related
to ARSE in the same family of sulfatases, as having similar effects on vascular calcification as
that demonstrated in our in vitro studies for ARSE. Based on our previous studies, we have also
identified histone deacetylase 4 and 5 (HDAC4/5) to be important regulators of vascular
calcification, mediated by subcellular localization of HDAC4/5 in the cytosol through
phosphorylation by focal adhesion kinase (FAK). The goal of this project is to perform in vitro, ex
vivo, and in vivo studies to test the hypothesis that ARSE/SULF1 and HDAC4/5 are important
and novel determinants of vascular calcification that induce the phenotypic switch of VSMCs to
osteogenic cells. Overall, my aim is to unravel novel molecular mechanisms underlying VSMC
function and calcification that contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease. Through world-class didactic opportunities and close mentorship from experts in the
field of vascular biology and genomics, I will complete this project having gained valuable skills
in bioinformatics, in vitro cellular assays modeling vascular disease, in vivo mouse model
experiments, scientific communication and laboratory leadership. By the end of the fellowship, I
will have gained skills necessary to develop my own research program and ultimately launch my
own career as an NIH-funded vascular surgeon scientist."

Pulmonary disorders like respiratory infections are one of the leading causes of death in the world and result in
millions of deaths annually. The immune system’s initial line of defense against lung disease are mononuclear
phagocytes called alveolar macrophages (AMs). These immune sentinels play an important role during
homeostasis by clearing foreign pathogens like microbes and toxins in the airways of the lungs via
phagocytosis. Additionally, AMs have an active role in pulmonary tissue repair by conducting efferocytosis, a
type of phagocytosis that specifically removes apoptotic cells. By preventing the release of proinflammatory
cytokines while secreting anti-inflammatory signals during efferocytosis, AMs contribute to barrier immunity and
exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype. Studies have also demonstrated that AMs communicate
intercellularly with epithelial and T cells to prevent unneeded proinflammatory responses. Research into AM
development has shown that tissue-specific cytokines derived from the lungs, such as GM-CSF and TGF-β,
are required for the differentiation of monocytes into mature AMs. This plastic response to the pulmonary
microenvironment is regulated by epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation and transcription factor
recruitment. Notably, aberrant AM development and function have been implicated in the progression of
multiple lung malignancies, such as influenza infections, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and some
types of lung cancer. Furthermore, dysfunctional AMs can contribute to the increased morbidity and mortality of
elderly and immuno-compromised individuals. As such, this study’s long-term goal to enhance the
understanding of epigenetic mechanisms governing AM development and function tightly aligns with NIH’s
mission to prevent disease and improve human health. The key focus of this project aims to investigate the
role of PBRM1, the defining subunit of the SWI/SNF family PBAF complex, in dictating the development and
function of murine AMs. To elucidate the effects of PBRM1-deletion on AM development and phenotype, I plan
to 1) determine the requirement for PBRM1 in AM development and self-renewal, 2) determine the role of
PBRM1 in transcriptional and epigenetic programs of AMs by performing RNA-seq and ATAC-seq on PBRM1
WT and KO AMs to identify pathways and transcription factors which may be dependent on PBRM1, as well as
overlapping this data with CUT&RUN data of PBRM1 and transcription factors known to drive AM
development, such as PPARγ and PU.1.; and 3) determine the functional effects of myeloid-specific PBRM1
deletion during influenza infection. These studies will assess the epigenetic and transcriptional effects of
PBRM1-loss in AMs and provide evidence for novel co-regulators of PBRM1. In the future, this research will
serve to inform the development of targeted therapies of PBRM1-dependent processes affecting lung disease."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to dramatic effects on the affected
individuals and their families. While the characterization of the genetic contribution to AD and underlying
molecular mechanisms has advanced the understanding of the disease in recent years, studies have failed to
find definitive mechanisms that account for disease progression. The influence of pathogens on AD potentially
mediates an environmental impact on the established genetic contributions to AD. Here, we directly dissect the
contribution of pathogen-related effects down to the cell-type-specific molecular basis by systematic profiling,
computational integration, and experimental validation of the transcriptional signatures across individuals, brain
regions, and cell types. In Aim 1, we use scRNA-seq in human, mouse, and human iPSC brain organoid samples of
AD that are infected with Herpes Simplex Virus 1 or Cytomegalovirus (HSV-1/CMV) to generate millions of single-
cell (sc) level maps with the end goal of a transcriptional atlas. In Aim 2, we analyze the resulting datasets and
underlying molecular mechanisms, enabling us to discover and converge genes, pathways, cell types, and
brain regions to functional and causal mechanisms that drive pathogen-related alterations. In Aim 3, we use
our well-established iPSC model to test our predicted mechanisms with both high-throughput and cell-type
specific assays. The resulting datasets, computational predictions, and experimentally-supported mechanisms
will shed light on the pathogen-related influences on AD pathology and will help deepen our understanding of
the disease in general as we develop more personalized therapeutic approaches to treating AD."
10881653,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infants with Rett syndrome (Rett) are born with loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding MeCP2, a global
regulator of gene expression. MeCP2 dysfunction in the brain severely affects neurons, leading to developmental
deficits of varying severity that manifest after 6 months of age. Current treatments can manage some symptoms,
but correcting MECP2 mutations would more effectively restore patients’ quality of life. CRISPR gene editing has
made this approach conceivable. Among CRISPR technologies, prime editing is the most flexible, utilizing an
RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease fused to reverse transcriptase to “search and replace” mutations in post-mitotic cells.
Thus, prime editing is a strong candidate for Rett treatment. Yet, prime editor has only been delivered to neurons
via lentivirus (not clinically relevant), and its editing efficiency in cells is low.
Previous work demonstrates that delivery of Cas9 mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNP) is simple,
safe, and supports robust editing in mouse liver. LNP-encapsulated mRNA also delivers to brain, but delivery of
prime editor mRNA and efficiency of prime editing in neurons remains untested. In addition, chemically modifying
the guide RNA of other CRISPR systems can protect against nuclease-mediated degradation and improve gene
editing rates in cells. The Watts lab recently developed a method to synthesize chemically modified prime editing
guide RNA (pegRNA), something that was considered unfeasible due to the length of pegRNA (~150 nt). The
effect of pegRNA modification on prime editing efficiency has not yet been tested.
With support from Drs. Jonathan Watts (nucleic acid chemistry), Michael Green (Rett neurobiology), Erik
Sontheimer (prime editor biology), Scot Wolfe (gene regulation), and Athma Pai (bioinformatics), this project
seeks to establish and chemically optimize mRNA-based prime editors to correct MECP2 mutations and reverse
their phenotypes in neurons. Aim 1 will establish baseline effectiveness of mRNA-delivered prime editor (vs.
lentiviral) against the most common Rett mutation (a missense mutation) and two clinically severe nonsense
mutations in HEK cells expressing each mutant MeCP2, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),
and iPSC-derived neurons. This Aim will also probe neurons with and without editing to understand the molecular
phenotypes of each MECP2 mutation and extent to which editing reverses them. Aim 2 will iterate on the Watts
lab’s pegRNA assembly method to optimize pegRNA yield and synthesis time, and identify editing-compatible
pegRNA modification patterns using in vitro and in cellulo assays. The effect of pegRNA modifications on MECP2
editing will be tested and optimized in HEK cells, iPSCs, and iPSC-derived neurons, as in Aim 1. Molecular
phenotypes of prime edited vs. unedited neurons will also be characterized as in Aim 1. This work will offer
insight into how MeCP2 mutants affect severity of Rett phenotypes in neurons and inform development of a
prime-editing platform to treat any form of Rett as well as other neurological disorders. The training provided
from this research will prepare the fellow for a productive career in the gene editing and neuro-therapeutics field."
10837892,"A core requirement for modern data science is the annotation of data and datasets to support linkage,
indirect reference, and reasoning across domain specific knowledgebases. Clinical laboratory data must be
annotated with standard reference concepts to seamlessly play its part in data-science analytics. For over 25
years, the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC®) terminology standard from the
Regenstrief Institute has played the role of trusted identifiers for many clinical observations. LOINC codes are
logically composed from constituent Parts to describe unique concepts with sufficient detail to discriminate
specific labs and clinical findings. However, data science ultimately seeks to apply computational reasoning
and inferencing across data collections and public datasets. Static annotations, while establishing unique
identities for biomedical concepts, do not contribute to the goals of reasoning and inference absent asserted
relationships between and among a) the concepts within a specific terminology such as LOINC, and ideally b)
concepts in related terminologies and ontologies. The core purpose of this proposal is to engineer LOINC
content so that datasets that are annotated with LOINC elements (codes and concepts) will facilitate data
science analytics. This will be achieved through OWL rendering, linkage to well-formed external ontologies,
demonstrating applications that leverage the logical associations, and engaging the LOINC and data science
communities to prioritize and validate these efforts. We will restructure LOINC components, terms, and codes
into an Ontology Web Language (OWL) rendering to support reasoning. This will include the formalization of
LOINC groups and potential related aggregations under “uber codes” (e.g. all blood glucoses). We will link
LOINC Components Parts to external, unencumbered ontologies such as Chemical Entities of Biological
Interest (ChEBI). These linkages can inform the hierarchy and relationships asserted in the OWL structure.
We will demonstrate the application of OWL and related hierarchical reasoning services to allow lumping,
splitting and linking of clinical data that is directly or indirectly anchored in LOINC. Using FHIR examples,
provide examples and code libraries that allow observations to be queried and aggregated (e.g. all blood
glucoses). Reasoning LOINC will be distributed as an open-access resource, in harmony with the OBO
community and related biomedical terminology and classification resources. We will leverage existing groups
and organizations such as LOINC Users group, CD2H, and ACT, to solicit use cases and dynamically evaluate
ontology development and priorities."
10829350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic cancer remains a lethal cancer in part because of our lack of understanding of its
progression and pathogenesis. Dysregulation of normal progenitor cells can result in the initiation of
cancer. An often-overlooked epithelial progenitor niche of the pancreas are the pancreatic ductal
glands (PDGs), which are blind outpouches stemming from the main pancreatic duct. Previous
analyses have shown an enrichment of pluripotent potential and pancreatic cancer pathways within
cells of the PDGs. Cells expressing trefoil factor family 2 (TFF2) give rise to differentiated progeny
that migrate to the ductal epithelium during pancreatitis; in-vivo TFF2 knockout experiments have
shown these cells are crucial for regeneration of the ductal epithelium. The contribution of this
progenitor niche to PDAC initiation and progression remains largely unexplored. Transgenic mice
were developed in which expression of Cre-recombinase can be induced within TFF2 expressing
cells (Tff2CreERT). Mice with Cre-dependent oncogenes and a dual-color fluorescent reporter (KrasLSL-
G12D; P53fl/fl or Smad4fl/fl; Rosa26mT/mG) were crossed with these animals allowing for simultaneous
activation of oncogenes and permanent GFP tagging of TFF2 expressing cells of the PDGs and
subsequent progeny. Preliminary data show that TFF2-expressing PDG cells exhibit increased
stemness following oncogenic activation and give rise to a wide spectrum of lineage traced
premalignant lesions and cancers. Our central hypothesis is that the activity of oncogenic insults in
PDG cells with stem-like properties results in unique lineage specification and transformation,
producing premalignant and malignant lesions similar to those observed in humans."
10808872,"Decision making is a fundamental cognitive process, and many decisions are based on gradually accumulated
evidence. Thus, it is critical to understand the mechanistic basis underlying this accumulation process.
Traditional models of evidence accumulation are based on low-dimensional attractors where individual neurons
show ramping activity throughout a trial. However, an increasing number of studies have observed
choice-selective sequences in their neural recordings, in which neurons fire transiently and sequentially with
the subset of neurons that fires indicative of the animal’s choice. Similar sequences have been observed in
other memory and decision-making tasks, suggesting sequences are a fundamental form of neural dynamics
that are inherently different from the persistent dynamics predicted by canonical models. To address the gap
between classic models and emerging data, I will first develop two novel neural circuit models that accumulate
evidence through sequences. The first will be a position-gated, bump attractor, where the set of active neurons
(“location” of activity in the population) encodes position along one axis and accumulated evidence along the
other so that evidence is encoded non-monotonically. In contrast to this location-based model, the second will
consist of two mutually inhibitory chains, where the firing rate (“amplitude”) of the active neurons encodes
evidence, so that evidence is encoded monotonically. Thus, these two novel models propose two alternative
mechanisms for the accumulation of evidence through sequences, which are distinguished by their predictions
about how evidence is encoded. Model predictions for the encoding of single neurons and the geometric
structure of the whole-population code will be tested by comparison to an extensive set of previously collected
neural activity during a navigation-based, accumulation of evidence task, which demonstrate choice-selective
sequences across the brain, including in the hippocampus, visual cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and
striatum. Thus, this project will address two key questions in our understanding of decision-making, how
evidence is accumulated through sequences and where these mechanisms are present in the brain, by
proposing novel circuit mechanisms and analyzing neural data throughout the brain. The fellowship training
plan equips me to explore these questions because I have chosen one experimental sponsor whose expertise
lies in the systems neuroscience of reward learning and decision making and one computational sponsor with
expertise in neural integrator models. Based at an institution at the leading edge of both experimental and
computational neuroscience, I will have access to the resources to expand my neuroscience domain
knowledge while gaining skills in computational neuroscience specific to modeling neural integration and
neural encoding. Overall, this project will develop two novel paradigms for the accumulation of evidence, based
on sequential neural activity, that elucidate differences in the underlying mechanisms across brain regions,
suggesting how decision making may be coordinated across the brain."
10811700,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondrial disorders are rare, often devastating genetic diseases affecting the brain, muscle, and other
organs caused by genetic failure of mitochondria, cellular structures that produce most of the cell’s energy.
Critically, there are no proven lab tests to track mitochondrial disease progression and no FDA-approved
therapies. Many hurdles exist to studying mitochondrial disorders in order to change this, two of which we
address in this project. First, because they are often most severely affected, earlier studies of mitochondrial
disease have focused on patient biopsy samples such as skeletal muscle that require surgery to obtain. Based
on clinical and research data, we are using blood instead, allowing us to collect many more samples without
painful and expensive procedures. Second, two sets of genes—nuclear and mitochondrial—are needed to
make mitochondria; and most methods used to study genes and their functional status can only be used to
examine one type. We are using modified techniques to allow us to study the presence of damaged
mitochondrial genes and functional status of nuclear genes at the same time. Using these two new
approaches, we have discovered a new cell type-specific pattern of damaged mitochondrial genes. In this
proposal, we aim to determine if cell type-specific patterns of damaged mitochondrial genes track with disease
progression, how these patterns arise, and how the amount of damaged mitochondrial genes related to
mitochondrial function in single cells. If successful, these experiments will improve our understanding of how
genetic changes cause the symptoms of mitochondrial disease and may lead to theories of how to develop
clinical lab tests for mitochondrial disease severity and, potentially, theories of how to treat mitochondrial
disorders."
10836533,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are the most common pregnancy complication and are associated
with an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which is also the leading cause of death for
women in the US. Emerging evidence suggests that environmental exposure during pregnancy may play an
important role in the development of HDP. However, several limitations exist, including 1) the ignorance of
residential mobility during pregnancy in exposure assessments, 2) the lack of studies considering different
subtype, onset, and severity of HDP, and 3) the lack of considerations of the totality of environment (i.e. the
exposome). While HDP have been linked to long-term CVD risk after pregnancy, limited data are available on
early maternal CVD risk (within the first five years after delivery) complicated by HDP. More importantly, no
study has focused on the impact of environmental exposures during and after pregnancy on maternal CVD risk
after pregnancy. In addition, risk assessment models of HDP predominantly rely on biomarkers that are not
ubiquitously tested among all pregnant women, and no predictive model has been developed to identify
women at higher CVD risk after pregnancy. This study builds on our prior work in the external exposome and
leverages our access to the unique statewide linked electronic health records-birth records data from the
OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium to address multiple challenges in the field by: 1) determining the
association between pregnancy external exposome and risk of HDP, considering the subtype, onset, and
severity of HDP and accounting for pregnancy residential mobility in exposure measurements; 2) assessing
early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy associated with HDP and the external exposome, and 3)
developing predictive models of HDP and early risk of maternal CVD after pregnancy. This research project will
be embedded in a comprehensive training program consisting of coursework, guided experiential and clinical
learning, seminars, and mentorship by an established team of experts. The training program is designed to
further my strengths and to develop new research skills while contributing to our scientific understanding of
environmental impacts on cardiovascular health among pregnant and postpartum women. The training
proposal details a five-year plan of formal and informal instruction in cardiovascular health, omics and
exposome research, biomedical informatics and data science, and professional skills. My short-term career
goals include completing coursework in all training areas, disseminating study findings through publications
and presentations, engaging in career development activities, and applying for independent R01 funding in the
third year of the award. My long-term career goal is to become an independent, collaborative, and productive
epidemiologist and health data scientist leading research programs in cardiovascular health, with a focus on its
intersection with perinatal and environmental epidemiology using big data."
10862658,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell membrane proteins regulate a multitude of cellular processes that are vital for organismal health. The
extracellular domain is critical for ligand binding and signal transduction of the full-length receptor. In addition,
approximately 2% of cell surface proteins undergo ectodomain shedding to release their extracellular domain.
Ectodomain shedding may terminate the function of the full-length receptor and/or lead to the generation of either
a soluble decoy receptor or an active ligand. The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), a type 1 membrane protein
central to the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease, is one such cell surface protein that undergoes ectodomain
shedding to generate various soluble APP (sAPP) fragments. Despite the known effects of the APP ectodomain
on cellular and cognitive functions and the potential applications to disease, the precise molecular mechanisms
mediating the function of APP ectodomain remains largely enigmatic due to the focus of the field on the Amyloid-
β region of APP. Thus, the goal of the lab is to elucidate the normal physiological functions of the extracellular
domain of the Amyloid Precursor Protein. Our approaches are designed to address the mechanistic gaps in
knowledge by leveraging our recent discovery that sAPP functions as a ligand for the GABA type B Receptor
(GABABR) and our recent identification of Phosphoglycerate Mutase Family Member 5 (PGAM5), a mitochondrial
serine/threonine protein phosphatase, as a novel candidate interactor of the APP ectodomain. One line of
research will elucidate the cellular responses of non-neuronal cells to sAPP and GABA B Receptor modulation,
identify signaling pathways downstream of the sAPP and GABA B Receptor interaction, and determine
mechanisms involved in the positive regulation of GABA B Receptor signaling by sAPP. A second line of research
will investigate the cellular conditions and subcellular compartments in which APP and PGAM5 come into
contact, the molecular basis of the APP and PGAM5 interaction (i.e. binding affinities, critical binding domains),
and the consequences of PGAM5 on APP phosphorylation and proteolytic processing. The work in these studies
will generate fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the protein-protein interactions
of the APP ectodomain and the cellular consequences of these interactions across different cell types."

This NIDCR Dual Dentist Scientist Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) for Tumader Khouja BDS MPH
PhD, will establish Dr. Khouja as an independent oral health services researcher developing and
implementing evidence-based interventions that integrate dental care into medical settings utilizing both
qualitative and quantitative research methods. This long-term goal will be achieved via a 5-year training and
research plan that will launch Dr. Khouja’s independent program of research and academic career and support
the NIDCR’s mission to increase and maintain a strong cohort of new and talented independent dual degree
dentist scientists. The career goals of this program are: (1) training in intervention sciences [and biomedical
informatics]; (2) gain expertise in qualitative methods to inform, design, and evaluate theoretically based
behavioral interventions, and (3) professional development as an independent researcher. These career goals
will be achieved via formal coursework, trainings, national conferences, mentorship, and research experience.
The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the barriers and facilitators to non-traumatic dental
condition (NTDC) management in the emergency department (ED) through quantitative and qualitative methods.
The first aim will determine the national variation in NTDC prescribing in the ED and subsequent ED/urgent care
revisits and hospitalizations within 30-days of an index ED visit. Using national electronic health records and
integrated claims datasets and a random effects model, we will identify factors associated with prescribing for
NTDC and variation at the patient, provider, hospital and state levels. The second aim identifies ED providers’
perceived barriers and facilitators to the management of NTDC in the ED. Using individual in depth interviews,
ED providers (physicians, advanced practice providers) will identify the facilitators and barriers to management
and prescribing for NTDC in the ED. The third aim will pilot and refine a multifaceted approach for NTDC
prescribing in the ED and assess the acceptability and feasibility of the implementation of this strategy in ED
settings. We will develop a 2-level interventional strategy [using human centered design methods] that will aid
ED providers in NTDC prescribing and refine it based on our findings from the previous aims and field experience.
As we test the intervention in an ED, we will use [EHR data from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
(UPMC) to] evaluate appropriate treatment and clinician experience with ED use for NTDC before and during
the intervention. Further trials will test the effectiveness of the intervention in U- and/or R-level proposals. An
outstanding interprofessional team comprised of a public health dentist, pharmacist, ED physician, behavioral
psychologist, biostatistician [and biomedical infromatician] will provide mentorship to ensure the success of this
project. The long-term goal of this program of research is to develop a generalizable and sustainable
intervention to improve NTDC management in ED and other medical settings. [This work supports priorities of
the U.S. Surgeon General, NIH Director, and NIDCR to integrate oral health and general health through
collaborative alliances and creating a diverse pipeline of clinician oral health researchers.]"
10830276,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate the poorly understood mechanisms controlling long
distance AMPAR transport in delivery and removal of receptors for synaptic maintenance and plasticity.
Excitatory neurotransmission mediated by glutamate and ionotropic glutamate receptors of the AMPA subtype
(AMPAR) at synapses plays a central role in cognition. Tight regulation of the number and function of these
receptors is, therefore, essential. Since synapses are often far away from the neuronal cell body, they are
critically dependent on long-distance transport by microtubule-dependent molecular motors to provide a steady
supply of AMPARs. The field of excitatory synaptic transmission has a detailed understanding of how cell-
signaling pathways control local synaptic AMPAR trafficking but almost no understanding of how these synaptic
signaling events control long-distance AMPAR transport. The major reason for this lack is technical: transport
studies require powerful, high-speed microscopy in intact neuronal circuits. Direct observation and informative
manipulation of transport in vivo is extremely difficult in vertebrates. We have pioneered real-time in vivo studies
of AMPAR transport in intact neuronal circuits using the transparent model organism, C. elegans.
 Here we will test a new mechanistic framework for the regulated cellular distribution of AMPARs to synapses
centered on the long-distance transport of receptors by molecular motors. Our model predicts that Kinesin-1
scaffolds (JIP1 and 3) are necessary for AMPAR transport and their assembly onto Kinesin-1 is dependent on
neuronal activity, calcium and calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (CaMKII). In addition, we identify a
modulator of transport, PTP-3A, that modifies export from the cell body and synaptic delivery ultimately affecting
memory. Specific Aim 1 will determine how synaptic inputs at cell bodies and at dendrites modify calcium and
AMPAR transport. Specific Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that synaptic activity leads to modification of the AMPAR
transport complex conferring different export and synaptic delivery properties. Specific Aim 3 tests the hypothesis
that PTP-3A the longest isoform of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP-3, regulates AMPAR somatic export
and synaptic delivery using 2 domains released by cleavage induced by neuronal activity. The experiments
described in these aims will combine genetics, in vivo spinning disk dual channel microscopy, optogenetics,
photobleaching and photoconversion, biochemistry and behavior analyses to elucidate the mechanisms of long-
distance AMPAR transport regulation by synaptic signaling. Our studies will: 1) provide a new model for
understanding the cellular mechanisms regulating synaptic function, 2) have broad impact on the understanding
of cargo delivery and removal mechanisms by molecular motors applicable to multiple biological systems, and
3) improve understanding of AMPAR transport that could reveal novel therapeutic targets for modulating
excitatory synaptic transmission in the context of human disease."

with the overarching goal of preventing disease and improving health through multidirectional engagement
that promotes systems change. The CEC leverages our Center’s environmental health research to address
critical environmental health problems by informing systems change locally, regionally and nationally. We
engage with diverse partners at 3 key levels: (i) policies (ii) institutions, and (iii) practices or behaviors. Over the
past 20 years, we have developed expertise in informing local policy and community decisions, and working with
national networks to maximize the impact of these changes. We target and work with 4 key audiences:
Community groups, Policy-makers, Public Health Professionals, and Educators, and focus our work around
Rochester’s community needs. Our Community Advisory Board (CAB) is at the core of these partnerships, and
includes community leaders, government agencies, regional academic institutions and private entities who meet
regularly. We also maintain a broad network of stakeholders by participating in local, state, and national advisory
boards, organizations, and events. New Capacity Building Projects will intentionally foster researcher-community
partnerships that lead to new research. The CEC is well-integrated with the EHSC, including the Internal Advisory
Committee, Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core, Pilot Project Program, and monthly faculty meetings.
These activities and interactions inform EHSC members about community trends, needs, initiatives, and
opportunities to promote multidirectional engagement. We evaluate the CEC’s impacts using approaches
appropriate to each of our diverse activities. The CEC promotes environmental health beyond Rochester by
leveraging national networks to share our products, projects, and publications. These national networks also let
us learn from other communities across the country. Our approach and success rely on long-term, deep
engagement around select issues of community concern that align with EHSC research expertise. We prioritize
projects that contribute to solving problems of environmental justice in our local community, and also respond to
national needs where translation of our Center research has significant impact on environmental public health.
The depth and breadth of our experiences, networks and engagement have us ideally poised for executing
ongoing activities and invoke new initiatives to complement and foster the growth of our Center. These include
building on partnerships related to lead poisoning prevention, healthy homes, equitable built environments,
perinatal environmental health, and indoor air quality. We will also develop new partnerships related to emerging
community concerns including corona viruses, vaping, and microplastics in drinking water. These partnerships
facilitate multidirectional engagement between EHSC researchers and community partners, promote systems
change and health equity, and advance the field of community engagement through developing, evaluating, and
disseminating novel approaches."

address identified needs. Two types of pilot project awards are offered on a bi-annual basis: Full Pilot Projects 
of up to $30K, and Mini Pilot Projects of up to $10K. Pilot Project applications are reviewed by a Standing Review 
Committee comprised of Center members with expertise ranging from epidemiology to basic science research. 
This committee includes both junior and senior faculty, the Director of Career Development Program and 
members with overlapping roles in the Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute at the University of Rochester

applications are read by the Director of the CEC, who works with PIs to enhance community engagement in 
ongoing research directions. Since the start of the current funding cycle, a total 48 Full Pilot Project applications 
and 29 Mini-Pilot applications were received. Of these, a total of 29 Full and 22 Mini-Pilot Projects have been 
awarded. Of the 51 applications that were awarded,15 were to junior faculty investigators, and 15 were awarded 
to non-Center members, of whom 7 have since become Center members. During the current funding cycle, 
approximately $993K has been allocated to Pilot Projects (both Full and Mini-pilots), which has resulted in 
approximately $15M (direct cost dollars) in new extramural funding. This is a notable return given not only the 
present extremely limited funding environment, but also considering that the most recently awarded pilot projects 
have not yet had sufficient time to mature into externally funded projects. Future directions include continuation 
of the Pilot Project Program to build new and strengthen existing areas of Center interdisciplinary and

10788465,"Project Summary
The worldwide obesity epidemic presents a significant public health crisis that is progressively worsening. This
has led to intensive efforts to identify the host and environmental factors that regulate human metabolism and
energy homeostasis. The gut microbiota has been identified as an environmental factor that regulates lipid
metabolism and absorption in the intestine, and thus promotes high fat diet-induced obesity. However, a major
knowledge gap remains about the specific bacterial and host factors that regulate intestinal lipid absorption and
metabolism. The overall goal of this proposal is therefore to identify the intestinal bacteria and host immune
recognition pathways that regulate intestinal lipid metabolism. Prior work by our group identified the circadian
transcription factor NFIL3 as essential for the gut microbiota’s role in driving obesity in mice fed a high-fat, high
sugar Western-style diet. NFIL3 expression is regulated by the microbiota, and promotes the transcription of
intestinal epithelial genes that regulate lipid absorption and metabolism. Preliminary studies of monocolonized
mice revealed that flagellated Gram-negative bacteria induced NFIL3 expression. Therefore, my central
hypothesis is that Gram-negative flagellated bacterial species, such as Escherichia coli, selectively promote lipid
absorption in intestinal epithelium. I will test this hypothesis by using gnotobiotic mice and genetic manipulation
of both mice and bacteria. My first aim is to identify intestinal bacteria that regulate intestinal lipid uptake and
metabolism through NFIL3. Monocolonized mice will be fed a Western style diet and analyzed for lipid content,
gene expression changes in the small intestine, and metabolic syndrome. I will then use genetically-altered
bacteria to identify specific bacterial factors that are required to promote intestinal lipid absorption. My second
aim is to identify the host immune pathways that are required for bacterial activation of NFIL3-regulated metabolic
pathways. Genetically altered mice with deletions of specific pattern recognition receptors will be used to identify
host factors required for lipid uptake and metabolism. These studies will provide new insight into how the
microbiota regulates lipid metabolism of the host and should identify new avenues for therapeutic interventions
into obesity."
10830270,"Unmet social needs create immediate risks to health, increase utilization, wait times and costs, and contribute
to provider burnout. Due to the high prevalence of unmet social needs such as housing or income insecurity
among patients, the emergency department (ED) is an opportune setting for intervention. Problematically, social
needs frequently go unscreened and unaddressed in EDs. Basic workflow issues and time constraints inhibit
screening. Patients may decline screening or avoid questions they deem stigmatizing. While numerous ques-
tionnaires exist to screen for a broad number of social needs, their reliability and validity are unknown. Predictive
modeling combined with clinical decision support (CDS) could overcome the above challenges that limit screen-
ing and perpetuate ED patients' unmet social needs. Our long-term goal is to support effective care by enabling
provider access to clinical and social context information. The objective of this proposal is to implement and
evaluate a CDS tool that identifies ED patients needing a referral to the social providers best equipped to address
social needs. Our central hypothesis is that the purpose of screening is to inform referrals to appropriate services
and that, in the context of social needs, social workers, dietitians, and behavioral health counselors are the
professionals best suited to meet patients' needs. Leveraging a proven technological infrastructure and collabo-
ration with an urban, safety-net ED, this project will accomplish three aims. Aim 1, Compare the effectiveness of
predictive modeling vs. questionnaire-based screening in identifying patients in need of social and behavioral
services, compares the performance of predictive modeling against questionnaire-based screening. Predictive
modeling will leverage a unique combination electronic health record, health information exchange, social ser-
vice organization, and public health data sources. Aim 2, Identify ED providers' and patients' perceptions of

tive methods grounded in implementation and patient-centered innovation theoretical frameworks to understand
ED patient, provider, and staff perceptions of enablers and barriers to screening. Aim 3, Quantify the impact of
real-time screening for social needs on subsequent utilization, will implement and evaluate a CDS intervention
(using the best performing approach from Aim 1 and guided by the findings of Aim 3) that facilitates appropriate
referrals to social and behavioral providers in a pre-post with comparison group longitudinal design. Outcomes
of interest are reduced ED revisits, increase follow-up visits with primary care providers. The proposed research
is significant because it directly compares two approaches to addressing the widespread problem of unmet social
needs. This proposal is innovative by applying predictive modeling with personal, social service, and clinical
context data, and by shifting social screening research to the ED. By working with an urban safety-net hospital,
this research addresses the priority populations of socioeconomically disadvantaged and minority populations
who are disproportionality burdened by unmet social needs."
10794378,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hemophilia is an x-linked bleeding disorder characterized by deficiencies in clotting factor VIII or IX. Patients
suffer from frequent joint bleeding, which may lead to debilitating hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Both
symptomatic and silent bleeds, as well as unnoticed microhemorrhages, generate hemosiderin deposits, the
primary etiology of joint degeneration in HA. Non-invasive imaging of both hemosiderin and the subsequent
damage it causes to cartilage and subchondral bone is important for optimizing costly prophylactic treatment
plans and monitoring disease progression. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for
evaluation of HA, it has significant limitations including imprecise, only semi-quantitative evaluation of
hemosiderin deposition, and an inability to detect both early iron deposition and degeneration in cartilage and
subchondral bone. Ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI sequences, with TEs ~100 times shorter than those of
clinical sequences, can overcome these limitations. Using targeted UTE sequences, fast transverse relaxation
signals from hemosiderin and the osteochondral junction (OCJ) can be directly detected with high contrast.
This study aims to develop a complete package of UTE MRI techniques for evaluation of HA, including 1)
accurate quantification of hemosiderin through volumetric mapping of T1, T2*, and susceptibility; 2) assessment
of early cartilage damage by monitoring proteoglycan and collagen; and 3) evaluation of the OCJ, and aims to
apply this package in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of three groups of HA patients (mild, moderate,
and severe), as well as an age-matched control group. In Aim 1 we will further optimize the speed, contrast,
resolution, and accuracy of a series of 3D UTE MRI techniques for morphological and quantitative evaluation
of hemosiderin in synovium, and for assessment of articular cartilage health and OCJ changes using a clinical
3T MR scanner. In Aim 2 we will evaluate the optimized 3D UTE and clinical MRI sequences for assessment
of hemosiderin, cartilage, and the OCJ in ex vivo tissues from hemophilia patients following total knee
arthroplasty (n=10) and from normal cadaveric human knee joints (n=10). We will compare UTE-based
morphological and quantitative measures (tissue magnetic susceptibility, T1, T2*, fat fraction, adiabatic-T1ρ,
magnetization transfer ratio, macromolecular fraction) with clinical MRI evaluation of hemosiderin, cartilage,
and the OCJ, and we will correlate UTE and clinical MRI measures with histopathology, biochemistry, and
biomechanics. In Aim 3 we will apply the optimized 3D UTE and clinical MRI techniques to evaluate outcome
of prophylaxis in three groups of hemophilia patients with mild (n=20), moderate (n=20), and severe (n=20) HA
at two time points (baseline and 12 months), and a group of age-matched healthy volunteers (n=20) once.
Cross-sectional and longitudinal UTE and clinical MRI measures will be correlated with Hemophilia Joint
Health Scores (HJHSs), Pettersson radiograph scores, and self-reported outcomes. We expect that UTE
sequences will be more sensitive to early changes in hemophiliac joints than clinical MRI."

The goal of the proposed project is to address how neuronal stress triggered by amyloid-beta and tau oligomeric
species induces protein connectivity dysfunctions and alters protein-to-neuronal circuit-to-organ level function.
Our focus in on synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The hypothesis behind our investigation is that upon entry, the molecular stress triggered by amyloid-beta and
tau oligomeric species induces a maladaptive rewiring in the connectivity, and in turn the function of large subsets
of downstream neuronal proteins and their networks, through pathologic chaperome scaffolds termed
epichaperomes. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary data obtained by the Chiosis lab showing that
neuronal lineages are especially prone to form epichaperomes following stressors, and that most vulnerable to
epichaperomes are protein pathways with key roles in synaptic plasticity. Additional preliminary experiments
supporting feasibility of our experimental plan are provided by studies from the Arancio laboratory and others
demonstrating that A and tau oligomers alter synaptic connectivity leading to memory loss. Our preliminary
observation that dismantling the pathologic epichaperome structures into normal, folding chaperones rebalances
protein network connectivity and functionality to those seen in physiological conditions, are also in support of our
scientific premise.
To execute these studies, we use iPSC-derived cellular models and mouse models of AD and combine the
synergistic expertise of Drs. Arancio (synaptic plasticity, biology of AD), Chiosis (chemical biology of pathologic
protein networks, translational research), Fraser (mouse models of AD and AD biology), Zhou (iPSC models in
disease) and Mertens (consultant on hiPSC and iN-based cellular models for synaptic function study in AD).
We expect that our studies will deliver proteome-wide functional insights and comprehensive, mechanistic
understanding into how A and tau oligomers lead to synaptic failure and cognitive defects. In addition to
providing new insights into AD biology, our studies have immediate translational applications. With an
epichaperome therapeutic discovered by the Chiosis lab moving into Phase 2 clinical evaluation in AD,
hypotheses tested within the present proposal may have immediate impact in human AD."
10837761,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The majority of breast cancers express estrogen receptor a (ER+), a molecule that typically promotes cell
proliferation when activated by its ligand estrogen. Despite successes seen in treating patients with ER+ breast
tumors with endocrine therapies, approximately 33% of these treated patients will develop recurrent metastatic
tumors after endocrine treatment. These recurrent tumors primarily metastasize to bone and do not respond to
current treatment options. Bone is the most common and one of the most dangerous sites for breast cancer
metastatic tumor growth. At death, roughly 73% of women with breast cancer have bone metastasis. The bone
architecture and the ubiquity of vascular sinusoids provide accessibility to and easy exit from bone to increase
the spread through the body from the metastatic bone tumor. The bone microenvironment releases cytokines,
chemokines, and growth factors that inhibit colonization of cancer cells in healthy bone or support colonization
in cancer. These factors also can create an immunosuppressive environment that prevents a normal immune
response or response to immunotherapy.
In the proposed research, we will investigate how the chemokine Cxcl5, its decoy receptor Ackr1, and its
receptor Cxcr2 contribute to ER+ breast cancer metastatic colonization of bone. We also will examine CXCR2
inhibitors for their efficacy as single agents and as a combination therapy (with bisphosphonates or
immunotherapy) to inhibit breast cancer metastasis to bone. CXCR2 inhibitors are attractive therapeutics
against metastatic breast cancer that may have efficacy in treating the formation of metastatic bone tumors
that are dependent on the CXCL5:CXCR2 signaling axis and resistant to current therapies. Since patients with
these tumors currently have few treatment options and often are incurable, this study could have significant
translational potential. Significantly, if targeting or inhibiting these factors can reduce bone metastasis in
preclinical animal models, then we will be in a position at the end of the grant period to propose that these
compounds be used in a clinical trial in breast cancer patients with ER+ tumors metastasized to bone. Since
these recurrent tumors typically do not respond well to current therapies, this treatment strategy would be
significantly impactful and bring significant hope for patients with this disease. Future development of additional
optimized small molecules or peptide inhibitors of CXCL5/CXCR2 will expand the therapeutic options available
to clinicians in the care of breast cancer patients with metastatic disease."
10832706,"SUMMARY
Modulation of the cytoplasmic concentration of Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) by inositol trisphosphate (InsP3)-triggered release
of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a ubiquitous signaling system that regulates numerous cell
physiological processes. InsP3-mediated [Ca2+]i signals are manifested as repetitive spikes or oscillations, and
they can be highly localized or propagate to provide signals to discrete parts of the cell. At the heart of this
complex signaling system is the InsP3R ion channel. We have provided rigorous understanding of the ion-
channel properties of the InsP3R, by studying the channel using powerful quantitative single-channel patch-
clamp electrophysiology of native ER membranes, a technique that we pioneered; how those properties are
regulated by physiological agonists and protein interactions; and how changes in these properties are reflected
in physiological outcomes. An important physiological target of InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ signals are mitochondria.
InsP3R channels play a fundamental role in the regulation of cell metabolism, primarily by supplying released
Ca2+ to mitochondria to stimulate TCA-cycle dehydrogenases to promote oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
and ATP production. We discovered that low-level constitutive InsP3R-mediated Ca2+ release to mitochondria
is essential for maintaining basal levels of OXPHOS and ATP production in most cell types, and that cancer
cells have a particular reliance on this pathway for their survival. The primary pathway for mitochondrial Ca2+
uptake is the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), a Ca2+-selective ion channel in the inner mitochondrial
membrane (IMM). As for the InsP3R, we have employed biochemical and powerful biophysical approaches to
understand the ion-channel properties of MCU, including patch-clamp electrophysiology of MCU Ca2+ currents
in individual mitoplasts. Our overarching effort has been to quantitatively understand the molecular
physiologies of the InsP3R and MCU channels whose integrated activities control cellular physiology and life
and death decisions. Recently, cryo-electron microscopic (cryo-EM) structures of both the InsP3R and MCU
have been solved. Because of our exertise in the biophysics and molecular physiology of these intracellular ion
channels, we are uniquely positioned to exploit this new information to address important questions regarding
the molecular mechanisms of ion permeation and channel gating and their regulation of both Ca2+ ion
channels. Our goals are to understanding the molecular mechanisms of InsP3R channel gating regulation, to
gain fundamental new insights into the molecular mechanisms of MCU channel ion permeation and gating
regulation, including by interacting mitochondrial proteins, and to exploit the information gained from the first
two goals to provide quantitative insights into ER-to-mitochondrial Ca2+ transfer. Because of the fundamental
reliance of cancer cells on this signaling system and its role in familial Alzheimer's disease, we expect that
these studies will provide new and critical quantitative insights into a signaling pathway that is important in
many cell physiological processes."
10795031,"Project Summary
 The over 500,000 Americans with dialysis-dependent kidney failure, also known as end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), suffer from high mortality rates, severe morbidity, impaired quality of life, and frequent
hospitalizations and readmissions. The burden of ESRD falls heavily on disadvantaged communities, with
higher incidence rates and lower access to nephrology care among racial/ethnic minority populations and
those living in high-poverty neighborhoods. Changes in coverage and payment financing policies in the
Medicare program have had substantial consequences for access to care and health equity in the ESRD
population. For instance, Medicare's decision in 1973 to extend coverage to Americans with irreversible kidney
failure led to marked reductions in deaths due to kidney disease and decreased racial disparities in access to
dialysis. Effective January 1, 2021, Medicare will open up enrollment of ESRD patients in private Medicare
Advantage (MA) plans. Historically, persons with ESRD have been ineligible to join MA plans except under
limited exceptions. Eighty-three thousand persons with ESRD (14% of Medicare's ESRD population) are
projected to join an MA plan within two years. Unfortunately there is little evidence to guide policymakers about
the consequences of managed care for persons with ESRD, variations across plans, and the implications for
disparities in kidney health. More broadly, MA enrollment has more than quadrupled over the past 15 years,
yet fundamental questions about the value of managed care for persons for serious health conditions remain
answered. Our long-term objective is to understand the effects of payment and financing changes on the
quality, equity, and outcomes of care for persons with ESRD. This mixed-methods study, the next step in our
agenda, will investigate the impact of the Medicare program's expansion of MA enrollment to the ESRD
population on dialysis care, hospitalizations and mortality. Our specific aims are: 1. Examine MA plans'
approaches to managing care for persons with ESRD by conducting qualitative interviews with representatives
from MA plans, dialysis organizations, and dialysis facility staff in geographically diverse markets. 2. Estimate
the impact of expanding MA coverage to patients with ESRD on mode of kidney replacement therapy,
hospitalizations and mortality. 3. Identify variations in the impact of Medicare Advantage on ESRD outcomes
by patient and plan characteristics. The project is innovative because we leverage an unprecedented policy
experiment in the Medicare program and the availability of plans across counties to derive causal estimates of
the impact of managed care for dialysis patients. This project will have a positive impact by producing timely
evidence about the role of MA plans in delivering care for persons with ESRD, a population with complex
health needs and social risk factors. We address survival, hospitalizations, and the use of home dialysis,
outcomes that have been prioritized by the nephrology community, the Medicare program, and the 2019
Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health."
10830341,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults. The
disease is universally fatal with current standard treatment being ineffective and debilitating. Cancer
immunotherapy has demonstrated remarkable clinical success against multiple aggressive cancers and
growing evidence suggests that boosting the body’s immune system can help eliminate highly aggressive and
advanced tumors, including those resistant to conventional therapies. Its effectiveness against GBM, however,
remains unclear, with multiple clinical trials exploring cancer immunotherapy regimens for GBM failed to
demonstrate significant improvement in patient outcomes. Our group and others have recently discovered that
GBM cells overexpress innate checkpoint CD47 to evade detection and clearance by professional antigen
presenting cells (APCs). The expression level of CD47 was also found to correlate with survival in GBM
patients. However, multiple studies showed that blockade of CD47 provided modest survival benefit
in preclinical models of human cancers and additional phagocytosis checkpoints such as the β2 microglobulin
(B2m) subunit of MHC-I molecule have been identified to promote tumor immune evasion. Disruption of B2m
interaction with its phagocyte receptor leukocyte Ig-like receptor B1 (LILRB1) promotes phagocytosis of a
diverse collection of tumor cells that were resistant to CD47 blockade. Yet, when anti-CD47 and anti-B2m
antibodies were administered independently, we did not observe improved GBM phagocytosis. Therefore,
based on these findings, we hypothesize that simultaneous blockade of phagocytosis checkpoints CD47 and
B2m will activate innate immune responses against GBM, leading to a potent and durable adaptive antitumor
immunity. To this end, we developed a novel bispecific antibody (CD47-B2m) that readily crosses the blood
brain barrier (BBB). Aim 1 of the proposal will mechanistically examine whether CD47-B2m can promote
antigen-specific antitumor T cell responses by APCs through induced GBM cell phagocytosis. In Aim 2, we will
investigate if innate immune sensing pathways are critical in bridging innate and adaptive antitumor immunity
in the setting of phagocytosis checkpoint blockade by CD47-B2m. Finally, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the use of
CD47-B2m as a novel immunotherapeutic for GBM in clinically relevant murine models of GBM as a
monotherapy or in combination with radiation. We will also investigate potential molecular mechanisms that
predict treatment responses. If successful, our study will provide important preclinical data supporting further
investigation of a completely novel immunotherapeutic agent against GBM. Additionally, the results generated
here will highlight the importance of bridging innate and adaptive immunity to produce the most optimal
antitumor immune responses. The concept of targeting multiple phagocytosis checkpoints can be applied to
potentially all human cancers, and if successful may provide a new strategy to enhance the effectiveness of
cancer immunotherapies."

Current HIV curative strategies have proven insufficient to eradicate viral reservoirs or prevent viral rebound after
antiretroviral therapy (ART) cessation. The unifying hypothesis for the BEAT-HIV Collaboratory is that
through a better mechanistic understanding of HIV latent reservoirs and host factors governing viral
control and reactivation, long-term viral remission or eradication of HIV will be achieved by combination
immunotherapy inclusive of bNAbs, adoptively transferred immune cells, and nanoparticle therapies.
We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three highly interconnected research focus areas. The first aim will seek
to understand epigenetic status of intact proviruses, extrinsic/intrinsic factors affecting proviral reactivation and
expression, and novel host mechanisms for post-treatment control of HIV. The second aim will develop
strategies for long-term control in the absence of ART by use of DNA-delivered anti-HIV bNAbs and eCD4Ig in
combination with optimized tissue-based CD8 T-cell- and NK cell-mediated responses. The third aim will
develop a combination nanotherapy and immunotherapy strategy to eradicate viral reservoirs. All aims will be
supported by a clinical biorepository (blood and tissue), CD34+ or patient-derived xenograft humanized mice,
non-human primate (NHP) models, and a clinical trial development group as a link to the ACTG. Community
engagement will advance education and a socio-behavioral sciences and ethics focus by leveraging a >25-year
relationship with the local HIV community thereby ensuring partnership with stakeholders. Central administration
of resources will ensure achievement of high impact milestones, study team communications, and yearly goal-
oriented resource allocation and/or redistribution as informed by advances in the field. As an established
Collaboratory, we bring together diverse expertise, innovation, and industry partners to develop and test novel
strategies to advance an HIV cure and/or durable viral control in the absence of ART under a single common
multi-investigator, multi-industry team. Studies within the three interconnected aims together with a strong
community engagement plan will lay the groundwork for future clinical trials that will integrate new knowledge
gained by the BEAT HIV-1 Collaboratory to eradicate or functionally cure HIV infection."

the pathogenesis of airway hyperresponsiveness and smooth muscle layer thickening,
cardinal features of asthma that affects nearly 250-300 million people worldwide. The
mechanisms underlying these biological and pathological processes are not fully
elucidated. Nestin is a type VI intermediate filament protein that has been implicated in
progenitor cell functions and cancer pathogenesis. The functional role of nestin in airway
smooth muscle is largely unknown. Pilot studies have shown that nestin may contribute
to the regulation of smooth muscle contraction and proliferation. In Aim 1, we will
determine the role of nestin in regulating airway smooth muscle contractility and
cytoskeletal signaling. In Aim 2, we will assess the role and mechanism of nestin in
airway smooth muscle proliferation and the growth factor-mediated pathways. In Aim 3,
the potential role of nestin-associated cellular processes in human asthma will be
determined. The role of nestin in allergen-induced asthma will also be evaluated in vivo.
Completion of these studies should advance our knowledge regarding functional role
and mechanism of nestin and cytoskeletal signaling in smooth muscle contractility and
growth in vitro, and asthma pathogenesis in vivo. Obtaining this knowledge will facilitate
the development of new therapy to treat asthma."
10828742,"Project Summary / Abstract
In the hours after learning, the activation of gene expression follows a specific pattern, producing transient
waves of expression needed for long-term memory consolidation. These changes require non-genetic (i.e.,
“epigenetic”) events, including modifications to: DNA-organizing proteins known as histones, the DNA itself,
and the accessibility of DNA to proteins. Additionally, the molecular changes necessary for memory require a
form of RNA-based regulation. In the absence of such changes, the long-lasting regulation of gene expression
during memory storage fails, and this could account for defects in memory that accompany many psychiatric
disorders. Our long-term goal is to define novel epigenetic mechanisms underlying memory storage and
synaptic plasticity by taking advantage of recent advances in our understanding of histone modifications, in the
development of single-cell RNA technology, and in the function of regulatory mechanisms mediated by small
noncoding RNAs. During the previous funding period, we defined a novel metabolic source of acetyl-CoA in the
nucleus and have obtained preliminary data about new forms of histone acylation and crotonylation associated
with spatial learning. We also developed bioinformatic tools to analyze single nuclear RNA sequencing data to
identify neurons activated by learning. We further established the reversal of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated
mRNA silencing as a novel epigenetic means of regulating activity-dependent translation, linking synaptic
activity to translational upregulation of key memory-related targets. These major findings provide the basis of
our proposed experiments that we believe will define the next frontiers in our understanding of the epigenetic
mechanisms of memory consolidation. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of a novel histone
modification, histone crotonylation, on the epigenetic landscape and gene expression during memory
consolidation. In Specific Aim 2, we will define cell type-specific transcriptional signatures of the hippocampal
neurons during memory consolidation and retrieval. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the microRNA-
dependent mechanisms that regulate long-term memory and synaptic plasticity driven by a microRNA
processing complex. An understanding of these key epigenetic regulatory mechanisms involved in the
consolidation and storage of long-term memories is expected to ultimately lead to the development of new
treatments for the debilitating cognitive deficits associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia,
autism, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression."

Dr. Weiner is a transplant surgeon and immunology researcher. His long-term career goal is to become a
leading surgeon-scientist in the practice of intestinal transplantation (ITx) and the understudied discipline of
intestinal immunobiology with the unique expertise and immersion in both to translate novel scientific findings
into major clinical advances. To that end, his short-term career goals are to 1) gain clinical expertise in intestinal
transplantation, 2) build on current understanding of the pathophysiology of rejection after ITx, 3) augment his
personal understanding of microbiology, innate immune defenses, and advanced microbial and T cell analytic
methods, and 4) develop an independent research career that is funded by R01 support. He has organized a
mentoring team with the expertise and experience to facilitate career development in this field, and he has the
commitment of resources and protected research time from his department chair and division chief. The
significance of his project is that ITx is the only therapeutic option for patients with intestinal failure once
parenteral nutrition fails. However, its use is limited by high rates of rejection, which necessitates increased
immunosuppression levels, predisposing patients to morbid side effects. This proposal investigates how the
relationship between the gut microbiome and host mucosal defenses correlates with rejection after ITx. Prior
work demonstrates that rejection is associated with both modulations in the gut microbiome and dysfunction of
host defenses that maintain homeostasis with flora. It is also known that rejection is associated with decreased
ratios of graft-versus-host (GVH)-reactive donor T cells relative to host-versus-graft (HVG)-reactive recipient T
cells within the graft. Based on these concurrent findings, Dr. Weiner hypothesizes that homeostasis between
the gut microbiome and mucosal defenses plays an essential role in maintaining the balance of GVH:HVG-
reactive T cells in the graft, thus regulating rejection. If true, rejection could be targeted with novel therapies,
such as fecal transplantation. Thus far, no longitudinal studies in human ITx patients have investigated
microbiome modulations in relationship to clinical course, T cell chimerism, GVH:HVG-reactive T cell ratios in
the graft, and rejection. Therefore, this work will characterize how changes in the microbiome in the gut after ITx
correlate with decreased chimerism and GVH:HVG ratios in the blood and graft, which are associated with
higher rates of rejection."

Significance: Binge-eating behavior is characterized by the consumption of a large amount of food and
accompanied by the subjective experience of loss of control. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has been shown to
be effective, but CBT and other options for binge eating are limited because treatment is not effective in all
patients, and because of high rates of relapse and attrition. A key reason for the limited effectiveness of
treatments is restrictive eating following a binge-eating episode, which is a good opportunity to deploy CBT
strategies designed to encourage a return to a normal eating schedule.
Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that a smartwatch app can be designed for use in treating binge eating disorder
using just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). Smartwatches with sophisticated motion sensors and
capable of deploying powerful machine learning algorithms can be trained to passively detect not only eating,
but the qualities that differentiate an individual’s binge eating behavior from his/her normal eating behavior.
CBT strategies can then be surfaced to the user after a binge eating episode to encourage the patient to
resume healthy eating patterns. Moreover, the device can be used to obtain an objective report of binge eating
episodes, as well as identify each user’s patterns of antecedents to the binge episodes.
Preliminary Data: The investigative team has trained a machine learning model capable of detecting eating in
free living situations, showing 23/23 accurately detected eating sessions in 60 hours of data captured across 7
participants. Further, it shows that two binge-eating sessions had differentiated characteristics in rate and
duration of eating from the normal eating sessions. The team also has deployed adaptive interventions
successfully in several projects relating to problematic eating. Patient and clinician survey respondents agree
the concept could be useful in averting binge-eating episodes.
Specific Aim 1: The eating detection model will be improved and validated using data from patients who
routinely binge eat. After this validation, it will be deployed across binge eating patients to determine the
identifying characteristics of binge eating. Specific Aim 2: Develop the smartwatch app as a JITAI system for
delivering CBT
, with consultation from expert clinicians and end users.
Specific Aim 3: The team will conduct
an initial feasibility, usability and acceptability test of the HabitAware device to determine next steps and
progress to a Phase II proposal.
Long-Term Goal: After developing passive means of identifying binge eating, we will study the antecedents to
binge episodes in a Phase II, which would allow us to predict binge episodes further in advance and divert the
patient away from the harmful behavior. We will also extend the app to share data with a clinician."
10908998,"HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma (KS), also known as epidemic Kaposi sarcoma (EpKS), is a leading
malignancy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is among the top 10 malignancies by incidence and mortality in
most SSA countries. The AIDS Clinical and Trials Group (ACTG) at the National Institutes of Health in the
US has developed a criteria for staging EpKS. This criteria has 3 categories including tumor (T; T0 vs. T1)
which considers the extent of the tumor, immune status (I; I0 vs. I1) which is based on CD4 counts, and
systemic illness (S; S0 vs. S1) which is based on presence of opportunistic infections and other systemic
illnesses. Treatment of EpKS involves antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone for early-stage disease (especially
T0 stage), and ART plus chemotherapy for more advanced disease. Treatment outcomes for both
treatment approaches are variable, with some individuals responding favourably while others have no
response or even experience disease progression while on treatment. The T cell immune response is
thought to play an important role in the control of both KS and Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus
(KSHV), the etiologic agent for KS. This is because a decline in T cell immunity is associated with a
dramatic increase (~20,000-fold) in risk of KS development, while restoration of T cell immunity by ART
administration for EpKS and by withdrawal of the causative immunosuppressive agent for iatrogenic KS is
associated with regression of KS lesions in many instances. Also, metabolic dysregulation has been
observed in both KS tumors and KSHV-infected cells. Our group has previously reported that lipid and
glucose metabolism pathways are dysregulated in KS tumors, and more recent unpublished data on
plasma metabolomes suggests a clustering of metabolites by KS status. Whether KSHV-specific T cell
immunity and/or plasma metabolomes correlate with the different ACTG stages at presentation, and with
KS treatment outcomes longitudinally during treatment has not been extensively explored previously. We
hypothesize that lower ACTG EpKS stages have a higher underlying anti-KSHV T cell response than
higher EpKS stages. Also, we hypothesize that a good response to treatment is associated with a better T
cell response at baseline, and this response improves over time in good responders, with improved
recognition of KSHV proteins after immune reconstitution with ART and/or lysis of KS tumors by
chemotherapy resulting in more exposure to KSHV antigens. We also hypothesize that the plasma
metabolomic profiles are differential at baseline and by response to treatment, and reflect the extent of
metabolic dysregulation associated with stage and response to treatment. We will test these hypotheses
through the following specific aims: 1) Determine differences in KSHV-specific T cell responses between
KS stages at presentation and by response to treatment during follow-up; and 2) Compare plasma
metabolomic profiles by KS stage at presentation and between treatment responders and poor responders."

Kaposi sarcoma (KS), an HIV/AIDS-associated malignancy, is one of the most prevalent cancers in people
living with HIV-1 (PLWH) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). AIDS-associated KS is often aggressive with a high
rate of recurrence despite suppressive antiretroviral therapy and chemo/radiotherapy. Kaposi sarcoma-
associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent associated with KS. The high prevalence of both KSHV
and HIV-1 put millions of people in SSA at an increased risk of developing KS in their lifetime. Similar to other
herpesviruses, KSHV can remain latent with undetected viral load, but infected individuals can be viremic
periodically, suggesting the presence of an unknown reservoir or reservoirs that are harboring the KSHV
infected or transformed cells and virus emerged after suppressive treatment to lead to KS. Our team has
previously shown that KSHV can be found in brain tissues. The lack of a suitable animal model and the inability
to systematically sample various tissue compartments from KSHV infected individuals have hindered the quest
to locate these KSHV reservoirs in humans. However, with our recently established capability of full-body
autopsies on postmortem donors in SSA, we can now assess the presence or absence of KSHV reservoirs
throughout the entire human body in KSHV infected individuals. Our overall objective is to identify the KSHV
tissue and cellular reservoirs in KSHV seropositive individuals, and to determine the effects of HIV-1 infection
and KS on the size and distribution of these reservoirs. We hypothesize that KSHV reservoirs can be found in
multiple tissue sites, and the size and distribution of the reservoirs will increase in HIV-1 infected individuals
and KS patients. We will accomplish our main objective through the following specific aims: 1) Identify the
KSHV tissue reservoirs and determine the magnitude and breadth of the tissue reservoirs in both
asymptomatic and symptomatic KS with or without HIV co-infection. 2) Identify the KSHV infected cell types
and determine whether HIV-1 infection and symptomatic KS affect the size and distribution of KSHV infected
cell types and latency/lytic expression of the KSHV cellular reservoirs. This proposed study is significant as we
have the unique opportunity to utilize our full-body autopsy capability in Zambia to address the yet-to-be
answered questions of whether there are KSHV tissue reservoirs, the cell types involved, and how HIV-1
infection and development of KS will impact these reservoirs, and simultaneously expand this capability to our
other SSA partner in Tanzania. Findings from this study may contribute to our understanding of KS recurrence
after treatment and identify the potential target locations for any future novel treatment/therapy that can
specifically eliminate KSHV infection and KS development."

Human resource capacity building and training are urgently needed to establish a sustainable research
enterprise that will improve prevention, diagnosis, connection to care, basic mechanistic understanding, and
treatment of neoplastic diseases, like Kaposi sarcoma (KS) that continue to affect people living with HIV
(PLWH), despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). The combined expertise of our team, coupled with our
ongoing D43 cancer research and training programs with CDH/UTH and ORCI, will bolster the continued
development of CDH/UTH and ORCI research on KS and other HIV associated malignancies, while promoting
inter-African research networking. It will also provide opportunities for U.S. oncology, infectious disease, and
public health fellows interested in a research career in global health to gain essential experience in the LMIC
setting and develop research collaborations. To further enhance cancer research infrastructure in Tanzania
and Zambia, and specifically focus on KS, the “KS in the Era of ART in Africa Program (KEAAP)” proposes to
establish a network comprised of LSUHSC-NO, CDH/UTH, and ORCI that is focused on implementation
science, immunology, and histopathology of KS in PLWH. The goal of the Career Developmental Core is to
provide mentoring and training activities that will support the research, career, and leadership development of
promising investigators at ORCI and CDH/UTH as well as early-career clinical researchers from the United
States. This goal will be achieved by 1) implementing a mentored pilot research project program to support
scientifically meritorious projects led by junior investigators in Tanzania, Zambia, and the United States; 2)
expanding peer-to-peer mentoring and career development programs between CDH/UTH, ORCI, and
LSUHSC-NO; and 3) providing in-country courses, workshops, and cross-training between UTH and ORCI,
focused on targeted research skills and professional development needs of early-stage investigators. Through
these research and capacity building activities, KEAAP will foster an integrated mentoring approach, utilizing
faculty from all involved institutions to serve as a resource for consortium trainees. KEAAP will encourage
peer-peer networking among researchers through in-person and web-hosted training. KEAAP will develop a
next-generation of researchers, mentors, and trainers who are anticipated to collaborate in, develop and cross-
pollinate other’s research and training efforts that promote the development of increasingly more effective
research networks for Sub-Saharan Africa/US collaborations focused on improving health outcomes for PLWH."
10749044,"ABSTRACT
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is perhaps the most recalcitrant human neoplasm. With 10% overall
5-year survival and an increasing incidence, PDAC will be the second leading cause of cancer deaths within a
decade. The constellation of chemo- and targeted therapy resistant tumor cells, and a tumor microenvironment
featuring suppressive innate immune cells and fibroblasts frustrates therapeutic success. PDAC and preclinical
PDAC models both show a massive myeloid and fibroblast cell infiltration which suppresses effector T cells and
promotes metastases. Our data implicate a family of receptor tyrosine kinases Tyro3, Axl, MerTK (TAM RTKs)
in directing pro-tumorigenic polarization of CAFs and myeloid cells in PDAC. The homeostatic role of myeloid
cell TAM RTKs is to coordinate suppression of innate immune inflammatory responses to apoptotic material
preventing chronic inflammation and autoimmunity. Our preliminary data, show that TAM RTKs play non-
redundant and sometimes opposing functions in the PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME), leading to
polarization of myeloid cells and fibroblasts. Clinical trials of TAM RTK inhibition are beginning; thus, our work to
understand the consequences and mechanism of inhibition for each TAM RTK is both timely and significant.
Host MerTK and Tyro3 in wild type mice promote PDAC growth and contribute to lack of responsiveness to anti-
PD1 therapy, as germline MerTK or Tyro3 deletion slow PDAC growth, markedly reduces liver metastasis, and
promotes anti-PD-1 efficacy. However, in the Axl-/- mice there is an unexpected increase in metastatic
outgrowth. Our group has synthesized orally bioavailable, selective MerTK kinase inhibitors, which recapitulate
aspects of MerTK and/or Tyro3 genetic loss. Lastly our preliminary studies in patients identify MerTK+ and Tyro3+
myeloid cells and document an increase in MerTK+/Tyro3+ MDSCs in the blood of PDAC patients.
Hypothesis. MerTK+ and/or Tyro3+ monocytes, macrophages, MDSCs, and Tyro3+ fibroblasts are expanded in
PDAC, and have at least some separate roles in the suppressive TME and metastasis promotion. Our Specific
Aims are: Aim 1: To determine how MerTK and Tyro3 act in the innate immune compartment to accelerate
PDAC growth and metastasis and how Axl has the opposite effect. Aim 2: To determine the role of Tyro3 in
PDAC cancer associated fibroblasts and Aim 3: To evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting TAM RTKs in
PDAC in preclinical PDAC models (using UNC inhibitors one of which is in Phase 1 trials) in combination with
other cytotoxic and immune therapies. We will quantify, functionally characterize, and study gene expression
signature of MerTK+ and Tyro3+ myeloid cells in the circulation, tumors and lymph nodes and fibroblast cells in
the PDAC patient tumors before and during therapy. Success would represent a significant advance toward
understanding how to make immunologically “cold” PDAC tumors “hot” and responsive to immunotherapy."

The extraordinary growth and specialization that has occurred in the sciences has made it difficult to link the
increasing divide between clinical and basic science components of ophthalmic and vision sciences.
Translational research has suffered as a consequence. The Harvard Department of Ophthalmology is one of
the largest academic departments of Ophthalmology in the nation. With 188+ full-time clinical and basic
science faculty members, the Department makes significant contributions to ophthalmic and vision research in
virtually all basic, applied, and clinical subspecialty areas. The Harvard Department of Ophthalmology K12
program offers a customized and structured learning, research, and development environment to a select and
diverse group of highly-qualified, clinically-trained candidates who have recently completed (or are about to
complete) their training, but who desire further mentored learning experience so as to become independent
clinical scientists in their respective fields. Scholar candidates in this program will (i) complete a core
curriculum that will include (a) the Harvard Program in Clinical Effectiveness – a summer-long immersion
program in biostatistics and study design, (b) training in Responsible Conduct of Research and Bioethics, and
(c) participation in Grant Writing courses. Scholars will also (ii) perform research in a closely mentored program
under the guidance of lead mentors who are leaders in their respective fields. Trainees in this program will
additionally have the option of seeking an advanced degree (MS, MPH, PhD, ScD) at Harvard Medical School.
This is a competitive renewal application for the Harvard Ophthalmology K12 program, which has been very
successful to date in meeting its benchmarks of recruiting and training top-notch clinician-scientists in a
mentored environment. All program Scholars have been highly productive in research, have completed or
enrolled in degree programs, and received national academic and research awards and grants. Importantly,
since the start of our program in 2004 all the Scholars who have completed the program have been awarded
funding from the NIH or other competitive peer-reviewed funding sources. We intend to enroll 4 scholars in the
next renewal cycle (5 years) and each scholar will continue in the program for an estimated 3 years per the
NEI-mandated 3-year cap per Scholar. The progress of Scholars is reported by the Program Director twice
annually to the Program Advisory Committee and annually to the External Advisory Committee, comprised of
leading vision and ophthalmic scientists and educators in our nation. Our aim is to build on our progress to
date, and continue our training program for an additional 5 years."
10798285,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Organisms across all domains of life decorate their protein molecules with an incredible diversity of
chemical modifications. Modifications on proteins are critical for their function, affecting protein structure, stability,
and interaction partners. Many of the proteins and the enzymes that read, write, and erase these modifications
are closely tied to human diseases ranging from neurological disorders to cancer to type 2 diabetes. While these
proteins and pathways can be targets to treat these diseases, we lack a high-resolution, mechanistic
understanding of how the cell installs, recognizes, and leverages certain post-translational modifications,
specifically ubiquitination and spontaneous, non-enzymatic modifications. Our lab is working to understand how
protein-protein interactions dynamically regulate post-translational modifications to alter proteome landscape
and impact human disease.
 Protein glycation is an understudied post-translational modification that arises when a sugar covalently
attaches to a primary amine. This process occurs spontaneously under normal physiological conditions and is a
bio-marker in aging and the development, or worsening, of diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer's disease,
osteoarthritis, and atherosclerosis. Early glycation events are reversible and represent one of the few protein
repair mechanisms in the cell. Deglycation is mediated by an unusual “hybrid” kinase/deglycase called
Fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K). FN3K facilitates the removal of protein-linked glycans by directly
phosphorylating the attached sugar and destabilizing the sugar-protein linkage. FN3K and FN3K homologs are
found in all branches of the tree of life. The glycation of intracellular proteins is not well studied, yet the
conservation of FN3K and FN3K-related proteins underscores an important biological role for these enzymes. In
this project, my lab will use a multidisciplinary approach, including techniques and expertise in structural biology,
enzymology, and systems biology, to address sharply focused mechanistic questions regarding FN3K-mediate
protein repair. We hypothesize that an improved mechanistic understanding of FN3K will reveal new biological
insight into this ancient repair process, and that we can leverage this insight to better diagnose and treat diseases
associated with elevated glycation. In order to distinguish our contributions from those of others, we will integrate
reductionist and global approaches to develop a deeper and more complete understanding of the regulation and
repair of glycated proteins. Over the five-year funding period, the goals of this project are to: (i) determine the
structural and biophysical basis for FN3K-mediated protein repair (ii) systematically characterize the binding
kinetics and enzymatic activity of FN3K and FN3K-RP on diverse substrates; (iii) identify sites-specific FN3K
deglycation sites and their potential cross-talk with other PTMs. The successful completion of this work will
establish the molecular mechanisms that govern the protein deglycation repair process and will ultimately provide
needed breakthroughs in biomedical research."
10907810,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health (CCCEH) has provided an exemplary record of
solution-oriented children’s environmental health research. From gestation through young adulthood, CCCEH
has successfully followed children to address research questions relevant to the Northern Manhattan and South
Bronx communities and beyond, for whom many complex childhood diseases are highly prevalent. CCCEH has
prioritized enrollment of under-represented, at-risk Black and/or Hispanic pregnant individuals. We have
documented effects of physical, chemical, and social exposures on airway diseases such as childhood asthma,
and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), two highly prevalent
and frequently comorbid conditions with a large individual and societal burden. For the second phase of the
Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO-II) consortium, in Aim 1 we will use ECHO-wide
core data elements to examine common patterns of prenatal physical, chemical, and social exposures that
associate with childhood asthma and ADHD to understand their contribution to both disorders and their well-
established co-morbidity, which requires a large population such as ECHO to study. The ECHO cohort provides
a unique opportunity to examine robustly if prenatal exposure patterns contribute to asthma/ADHD comorbidity
via shared or distinct causal pathways. This science will address current gaps in knowledge that will improve
strategies for prevention and treatment by: 1) raising risk-awareness; 2) increasing referrals for assessment of
comorbid disorders; and 3) allowing for earlier intervention. In Aim 2, we will contribute to the development of
specialized protocols by proposing to measure biomarkers of prenatal chemical exposure using a novel bioassay
and adding annual measures of asthma and ADHD and their phenotypes to identify patterns of prenatal physical,
chemical, and social exposures that associate with incident asthma and ADHD as well as their phenotypes that
may have distinct etiologies. This more granular characterization of exposure and heterogenous outcomes will
enable more precise strategies for early identification and prevention along with primary and tertiary interventions
for asthma and ADHD. In Aim 3, we will implement the ECHO Cohort Protocol with high fidelity, maximizing the
retention of existing ECHO participants and supporting the continued recruitment of new pregnant and
preconception participants while emphasizing inclusive subject representation. In Exploratory Aim 4, we will
evaluate the role of chemical exposures during the preconception period on pregnancy loss and early
indicators of respiratory and neurodevelopmental health. Finally, the CCCEH site proposes a plan for
enhancing diverse perspectives that will be implemented while conducting all four aims. Altogether, this
proposal is intended to make a large scientific impact on children’s environmental health by both contributing
substantially to the ECHO consortium, and by leading consortium science that should positively impact clinical
practice and policy."
10744950,"Project Summary
Protein and RNA homeostasis are two major themes in the study of neurodegenerative
diseases, as exemplified by the implications of many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and other
neurodegenerative conditions. As a major pathology in ALS/FTD, protein misfolding and
aggregation, including those initiated by RBPs, manifest as a common thread among many
neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, a large collection of genetic, biochemical, and
pathological evidence underscores the importance of RBPs in ALS/FTD and other
neurodegenerative disease and calls for a better understanding of the functions of these RBPs
and their associated cellular processes. A prominent feature of RBPs is their involvement in the
formation of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, including stress granules that are formed by a
variety of RNAs and proteins under stress conditions. Stress-induced RNP granules are
considered to play important roles as part of normal stress responses in the cell and in the
pathological cascades underlying a range of human diseases including neurodegeneration.
However, the molecular basis of RNP granule formation and the full spectrum of RBP functions
remain to be elucidated. The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the molecular
mechanism of protein and RNA homeostasis related to stress-induced RNP granules and
disease-associated RBPs. The specific aims include understanding the diversity and functions
of stress-induced granules in physiological and disease-relevant conditions, elucidate the
mechanism of context-dependent granule assembly, and uncover novel functions of disease-
associated RBPs such as TIA1. We propose a series of fundamental studies that combine
biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches and usage of state-of-art cellular and animal
models to shed light on the novel structures and pathways related to protein and RNA
homeostasis and ALS/FTD pathogenesis. Successful completion of the project is expected to
provide insights into fundamental mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ALS/FTD that may
ultimately lead to development of novel interventions to treat ALS/FTD and other relevant
neurodegenerative diseases."
10814242,"The microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) aggregates and accumulates in multiple
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Abnormal tau accumulation leads to
oligomerization and formation of neurofibrillary tangles associated with neuronal loss, synaptic
dysfunction, and cognitive impairments. While tau undergoes different post-translational modifications
including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, ubiquitination is critical for tau turnover via the
ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy-lysosome pathways. Tau is known to be ubiquitinated by
various E3 ligases, including CHIP, TRAF6, and MARCH7. However, very little is known about the role
of deubiquitinases (DUBs) in the regulation of tau function, turnover, or tauopathy. The human
genome encodes >90 DUBs. Ubiquitin specific peptidases (USPs) are the largest family of DUBs
comprising ~50 members in humans. Of these, 27 are expressed in the CNS. Our results from an
unbiased screen of CNS-expressed DUBs identified USP11 and USP13 as positive regulators of tau.
By taking advantage of mouse models and human postmortem tissues together with molecular, cell
biological, imaging, biochemical, electrophysiological, behavioral, viral, histochemical, and recombinant
protein toolsets, this proposal will 1. validate the role of USP11 in tau pathogenesis as a function of age
and sex in vivo, and 2. determine the mechanistic basis of USP11 in tau stability, aggregation, and
toxicity in genetically modified neurons and in vitro systems.
Successful conclusion of these studies will determine the significant contribution of USP11, and its DUB
activity, to tauopathy in humans and mice as a function of aging and sex. USP11 levels could in part
account for potential sex differences in severity of tauopathy in humans and mice. Moreover, these results
will provide novel mechanistic insights to USP11 DUB activity, in concert with RanBP9, in tau modification
and toxicity."
10734776,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Problem drinking, defined as recurrent moderate-to-heavy drinking (3-14 drinks/week for men, 2-7 drinks/week
for women)31, is a common behavior in young adulthood. Despite risks, interventions aimed at reducing
problematic alcohol use among young adults yield only modest effects. One potential reason is that, among
many contributing factors, drinking can be a habit37. Habits are behaviors that occur in stable contexts (same
people, places, times), and that are independent of intentions. Instead, habits rely on internal and external
contextual cues that have been consistently associated with the activity39. When cues are disrupted, habits are
also flexible to change. To the extent that non-pathological, yet problematic alcohol use can be habitual,
periods characterized by changes could open opportunities for shifts in problem drinking behavior. Young
adulthood is one such period of multiple life disruptions and is often characterized by changes to habit-
sustaining cues, including environments, social networks, and activities. Young adulthood may thus be a
unique “window of opportunity” for translating intentions into change39. This project aims to 1) identify whether
problem drinking can function as a habit; 2) identify whether habitual problem drinking can be disrupted during
transitions; and to 3) determine whether effortful processes (e.g., intentions, self-regulation) supersede habits
when cues are disrupted. The proposed project will involve participant recruitment, data collection, and
analysis for two studies. Studies will leverage a participant population enrolled in a large project maintained by
the Sponsor’s NIDA-funded Center, as well as previously collected data and resources from the Center. The
applicant’s long-term career goal is to approach the study of substance use from multidisciplinary perspectives
and to capably communicate with translational research scholars to inform prevention and intervention efforts,
ultimately reducing the impact of alcohol use on individuals and society. The applicant’s specific training goals
involve complementing current training in social sciences, research design, and statistics by: 1) gaining
knowledge of the neurobiology of alcohol use and its effect on the developing brain; 2) application of intensive
longitudinal methods and data analysis for the study of alcohol use in daily life; 3) gaining foundational
knowledge of prevention science and translational research as it relates to alcohol use; 4) enhancing skills in
publication, dissemination, and networking; and 5) gaining further training in grant writing. The proposed
training plan was strategically developed to accelerate the applicant’s development as an independent social
sciences researcher with a multidisciplinary approach and knowledge of alcohol use, as well as skills to test
complex models using diverse designs and analytical strategies."
10788398,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cognitive Aging and risk of Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's related dementias (AD/ADRD) is due to
multiple aging and pathological processes that are driven by several upstream brain mechanisms and risk
factors. The success of recent multi-domain interventions and our preliminary data suggests that multiple
mechanisms need to be targeted for effective dementia prevention. In 2018, we proposed a simplistic conceptual
framework that builds on existing concepts using the nomenclature of resistance in the context of avoiding AD
pathology and resilience in the context of coping with AD pathology for investigating these distinct mechanisms.
This proposal addresses an important barrier for developing effective therapeutic or preventive strategies for AD
dementia - the poor understanding of how upstream risk factors and brain mechanisms (resistance and
resilience) that could contribute to or protect from protein accumulation and neurodegeneration. Our central
hypothesis is that identifying upstream brain mechanisms of resistance and resilience and modeling the complex
inter-relationships between protective factors, brain mechanisms, and longitudinal changes in amyloid, tau, and
cognition will aid in effective design of dementia prevention strategies.
To test this hypothesis, our primary aim is to identify mechanisms of resistance and resilience using the existing
infrastructure of the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) (individuals aged ≥50 years) and
Rochester Epidemiology Project (REP) which maintains a comprehensive medical records-linkage system. We
will collect the following variables for this proposal: Genetics, Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), and
systemic health (up to 20 years prior to scan from REP), longitudinal PiB and tau PET, baseline cutting edge
MRI (high resolution T1/T2/FLAIR and multi-shell diffusion MRI to assess perivascular spaces, microstructural
integrity, and cortical thickness), and cognitive decline. Our secondary aim is to develop and validate MRI-
based resilience markers that can be used in the NIA-AA research framework alongside with AT(N) biomarkers
to adjust for individual variability in cognition. Considering brain health measures (other than those included in
the evaluation of N) as resilience markers will improve the prediction of cognitive decline across all aging and
dementia studies. These measures will be able to capture biological variability due to SDoH and systemic health
and facilitate better comparison of biomarkers across populations."
10899433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a major complication that follows an episode anterior cruciate ligament
(ACL) rupture. In the US, there are over 100,000 ACL ruptures per year, from which 70% occur in physically
active subjects under 40 years of age. At 10 to 20 years after ACL rupture the prevalence of PTOA is estimated
to be 50–70%, regardless of surgical or non-surgical interventions. The failure of surgery to prevent PTOA leads
to the hypothesis that the acute changes in the joint following directly after injury triggers a cascade of events
leading to PTOA. However, little is known about how biological response to injury links to the subsequent joint
damage. Therefore, it is important to have tools available that provide comprehensive assessment of response
to injury and predict who will develop PTOA after ACL injury. Even though candidate biomarkers have been
investigated, their practical use is still very limited. The goal of this proposal is to investigate if biological response
to injury by measuring soluble biomarkers in synovial fluid (SF) and analyzing the genomic profile of extracellular
vesicles (EVs) isolated from SF obtained during the acute and sub-acute phases of ACL injuries of 18- to 40-
years old patients has the potential to predict joint degradation at 3-4 and 6-7 years after injury. Differences
between patients in the biological responses to ACL injury involve the presence of different cell types and
different cellular responses. EVs, which are being released by all cell types, are attractive candidates as all-in-
one, complex biomarkers able to provide a multi-faceted, integrated, snapshot “omics” joint profile of the entire
joint environment. In addition, given that these lipid bilayer–delimited particles carry cargos of proteins, different
types of RNA, and lipids derived from their parent cells, and that EVs can modulate target cells, make these
particles even more attractive as biomarkers. To measure progression of joint damage we will use advanced
MRI biomarkers developed in our labs that can detect early tissue degeneration, especially of articular cartilage,
a tissue, which is key in the early diagnosis of PTOA. Even more importantly, our MRI markers have shown
ability to predict progression. We aim to test our hypothesis that early response to injury captured by the cargo
of EVs will provide a new window into early biological changes directly after joint injury is associated with
progression of joint damage leading to PTOA. To achieve our goal to establish a biomarker profile that predicts
the biological response to the injury and ultimately the development of PTOA, we propose two aims. Aim 1 will
provide a panel of biomarkers directly after injury (2 to 3 weeks after injury) and at time of surgery (8 to 12 weeks
after injury) establishing the biological response to injury, and determine the relation of these biomarkers to
baseline MRI measures of joint damage. In Aim 2, we will test whether these biomarkers can predict changes
in the clinical and imaging outcomes determined 3-4 years and 6-7 years after injury. Finally, we will establish a
panel of predictive biomarkers for joint degradation validated by cost-effective methods employed in the clinical
setting."
10758274,"PD-1 blocking agents have achieved significant success as anti-cancer therapeutics. The mechanism(s) of how
PD-1 compromises anti-tumor function remain poorly understood. Although in trans engagement of PD-1
expressed in T cells by its ligands expressed on APC or cancer cells inhibits T cell activation, evolving discoveries
provide evidence that PD-L1:B7-1(CD80) in cis and PD-1:PD-L1 in cis non-canonical interactions occur when
these molecules are co-expressed on APC, and disrupt the canonical interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 in
trans and T cell inhibitory signaling. Thus, expression of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) is not
synonymous with PD-1-mediated T cell inhibition. We generated an antibody that recognizes PD-1pY248 (pPD-1),
which is required for PD-1 inhibitory signaling, and detected pPD-1 in mouse and human. We found pPD-1+ T
cells in cultures, in mouse tumor models and patient biopsies, but also in CD8+ T central memory (TCM) cells in
the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. In tumor bearing mice, pPD-1 was expressed in tumor infiltrating CD8+
T lymphocytes but mostly in Treg. We generated mice with conditional targeting of Pdcd1 gene (PD-1f/f) and
selectively eliminated PD-1 in Treg (Pdcd1f/fFoxP3cre). In tumor-bearing Pdcd1f/fFoxP3cre mice, Treg displayed
enrichment in pathways regulating lipid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, and production of
monocyte/macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and GABAergic neurotransmitter with known
immunosuppressive function. These features correlated with a significant increase of B cells and M2-like
macrophages, diminished activation of tumor infiltrating T cells, and increased tumor growth. Our results reveal
a previously unappreciated network by which Treg-selective blockade of PD-1 signaling reshapes the
immunological landscape and suggest that abrogation of PD-1 signaling in distinct cell types differentially impacts
the TME. Our findings indicate that pPD-1 is a powerful marker to identify T cells subjected to PD-1 inhibitory
signaling and support the novel hypothesis that cell-specific detection of PD-1 signaling by pPD-1 might predict
the outcome of checkpoint immunotherapy. To investigate these, we will pursue the following specific aims:
1. To identify the immunological and biochemical properties of pPD-1+ T cells in the context of cancer.
We will characterize pPD-1+ CD8+ TIL and Treg by single cell immunoprofiling, and investigate how T cell subset-
specific PD-1 signaling reshapes the TME by using our Pdcd1f/fCD8cre and Pdcd1f/fFoxP3cre mice.
2. To identify the molecular and functional properties of pPD-1+ cells in healthy individuals. We will
examine how PD-1 signaling shapes the properties of T cells in healthy individuals and in cancer patients and
uncover why only cancer-mediated PD-1 signaling induces TEX.
3. To determine expression, function and prognostic significance of pPD-1+ TIL in cancer patients. We
will examine cell-specific PD-1 expression and signaling in patient biopsies, co-expression of PD-1/pPD-1, PD-
L1 and CD80, and determine their prognostic significance."
10828312,"Shigella species are important, highly infectious pathogens of humans. In 2016, there were ~269 million cases
and 212,000 deaths due to Shigella. Infection with Shigella is associated with inflammation due to the recruitment
of neutrophils to the colon and massive tissue destruction. Despite this impressive host response, Shigella
survive in this harsh environment, primarily by replicating within and spreading between colonic epithelial cells
(ECs). Shigella survive by directly usurping and reprogramming host cell processes through the activity of ~30
type III effectors, proteins that they directly inject into the host cell cytosol via a highly conserved type III secretion
system (T3SS). Our research's overall goal is to use Shigella as a model pathogen to decipher the mechanisms
that enable intracellular pathogens to evade host innate immune responses and establish a replicative niche with
the cytosol of intestinal ECs. We have a long-standing interest in identifying and deciphering roles for effectors
in specific steps in Shigella pathogenesis. The first line of defense that Shigella and other enteric pathogens face
upon trying to establish a replicative niche within the gastrointestinal tract is the induction of the death of intestinal
ECs via pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of cell death that, if not inhibited, results in the rapid lysis
and/or expulsion of infected ECs from the intestinal epithelium and the processing and release of pro-
inflammatory cytokines. Here, we propose to investigate how Shigella type III secreted effectors cooperate to
inhibit pyroptosis, thus enabling this professional intracytoplasmic pathogen to establish a replicative niche within
the cytosol of intestinal epithelial cells. These studies are designed to significantly expand our understanding of
how Shigella, and likely other enteric pathogens, inhibit inflammasomes. At the completion of the proposed aims,
it is expected that the knowledge gained can be applied towards the development of novel host-based
interventions for the prevention and treatment of enteric infections, a particularly pressing need given emerging
issues with antibiotic resistance."
10875359,"ABSTRACT
 Opioid use disorders (OUD) are responsible for a major health and socioeconomic crisis in the US, resulting
in more than $500B burden on the economy and 75,673 deaths in the year leading up to April, 2021. More than
80% of OUD cases began with the use of prescription opioid painkillers, which remain in use due to their efficacy
in treating severe pain. The current clinically-used analgesics target the mu opioid receptor (MOR), which also
produces of liabilities of dependence and addiction leading to OUD, and potentially lethal respiratory depression.
Poorly treated pain and diversion and misuse of prescription opioid drugs are key contributors to the worsening
opioid epidemic. Development of new safe and effective analgesics with diminished addiction and abuse
potential is desperately needed to reduce usage of MOR agonist-based analgesics which promote OUD.
 We propose to target the sodium site in the delta opioid receptor (DOR) as a novel mechanism to develop
pain relievers devoid of the adverse effects associated with MOR agonist analgesics. We propose to use a
bitopic ligand strategy, generating novel DOR agonists binding to both the conventional orthosteric site and the
sodium site in the DOR. Emerging evidence suggests these novel bitopic DOR ligands produce analgesia but
lack the seizure phentotype associated with first generation DOR agonists limited to targeting the orthosteric site
of DOR. Our main goal is establish a relationship between DOR efficacy and potency at G-protein and arrestin
signaling pathways with binding of the ligands within the sodium site. Our intial bitopic design, C6-quino, is
validated by cryoEM structures suggesting that binding in the sodium site leads to partial agonism and a unique
functional selectivity away from arrestin pathway signaling over known DOR agonists binding solely to the
orthosteric site. To the best of our knowledge, probes with partial agonism at DOR are rare and their effects on
DOR-mediated analgesia and other adverse effects are currently not well established. Our current lead has
optimal in vitro ADME properties with favorable protein binding and metabolic stability, lacks the typical DOR
mediated seizures and other CNS adverse effects while ameliorating allodynia in a neuropathic pain model.
 Our central hypothesis postulates that targeting the allosteric sodium site in conjunction with the orthostric
site by diversification of DOR bitopics guided by cryoEM-enabled SAR approaches will lead to safer analgesics
effective against chronic pain. Preliminary evidence suggests probes synthesized will also lack the typical side-
effects associated with both DOR as well as clinically used MOR agonists. Using structure based design, we will
further optimize our current lead for DOR subtype selectivity (1000x selective), in vitro potency (with DPPDE-like
potency of G-protein activation) and in vivo DOR potency (seeking analgesia at ~5-10 mg/kg, s.c. or p.o.) to
design our next generation bitopics. Attempts will also be made to enhance brain penetration and CNS activity
by swapping the charged guanidino group. These goals will be accomplished by an interdisciplinary team with
synergistic experience in medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, structural biology and pharmacology."

Since its inception in 1972, AIC continues to be very highly regarded and has a fiercely loyal group of regular
attendees from the Midwest, but it also attracts immunologists from around the US each year. The Specific Aims
of AIC are to: 1) disseminate new immunological research findings from top labs in the field, 2) provide a forum
for trainees to hone their presentation skills, and 3) increase interactions between a diverse group of scientists
interested in immunology research. The meeting starts with a “Meet the Speakers” event for trainees, a Keynote
speaker, and a welcome reception on Friday. Saturday & Sunday have similar structures: morning symposia,
then smaller themed workshops, followed by poster sessions. The meeting ends on Monday with just a morning
plenary session. Each year, three different topic areas are chosen for the morning symposia. For 2022, 6 female
& 6 male invited speakers will present talks on Transplantation, T Cell Development, & Autoimmunity; the 2023
topics will be chosen by the AIC Chair in consultation with the Executive Council (EC) at the spring planning
meeting. All accepted abstracts (typically ~250 from postdocs/grad students/undergrads) are invited to give a
10 min. talk during the afternoon workshops, followed by a 1 h poster presentation. AIC is organized by a
dedicated all-volunteer group of faculty that serve multi-year terms including the “leadership track” that consists
of a 4 year commitment to serve as the Workshop Coordinator, the Secretary, the Chair, and then the Past
Chair/Councilor. Since 1992, the EC has strived to maintain a gender balance amongst its members; we typically
rotate males and females to enter the leadership track such that the 2022 meeting will be chaired by Dr. Richard
DiPaolo (St. Louis Univ) and the 2023 meeting will be led by Dr. Kerry Empey (U. Pitt). Another unique feature
of AIC is the Undergraduate Workshop with a Careers in Immunology panel discussion and a table fair of PhD
programs in Immunology. AIC is truly a formative experience for trainees and this remains one of the most
positively evaluated aspects of the meeting. The volunteer EC works hard to solicit academic and corporate
donations so that we can keep the registration fee low, allowing as many trainees as possible to attend this
meeting. In fact, the registration fee is waived for any undergrad who presents an abstract. The 50th annual AIC
is significant because it also marks the 30th anniversary of the inception of our Wallace Diversity Fellows program,
which provides travel awards and networking opportunities to underrepresented minorities."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tau-related neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by
neurofibrillary tangles which are composed of aggregates of the microtubule associated protein tau. The
accumulation of these tangles contributes to neuronal death and cognitive decline. While millions nationally are
plagued by Alzheimer’s, therapeutic efforts focusing on one of the main hallmarks of the disease, amyloid-beta
(Aβ) plaques, have remained unsuccessful. The lack of correlation between treatment and robust cognitive
improvement during these clinical trials highlight the urgent need to elucidate the preclinical mechanistic
changes driving disease manifestation. The physiological roles of tau include the stabilization of microtubules,
and bundling of F-actin filaments. While tau-microtubule interactions are well-studied, tau interactions with F-
actin are more poorly understood, but are reported to drive the development of pathological species such as
Hirano bodies, actin inclusions found in AD brains and other tauopathies. Tau can form other functional or
pathological interactions, including recently reported binding to post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95),
which was shown to interfere with functional hyperemia and promote the neurotoxicity induced by amyloid-
beta. Tau is also modified by a rich array of post-translational modifications (PTMs), which have been shown to
alter normal and pathological tau interactions. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that tau PTMs
within the critical PHF6 and PHF6* hexapeptide motifs modulate tau interactions with binding partners
such as PSD-95 and F-actin and thereby contribute to the role of these partners, as well of changes in
tau structure and function, in specific processes associated with disease manifestation. Using
biophysical methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, I will characterize the
interactions of tau with F-actin and PSD-95 and assess the effects of PTMs located within the PHF6 and
PHF6* motifs on these interactions. Our structural observations, complemented by functional studies
performed both by myself and our collaborators, will contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanistic
changes in tau behavior that drive the manifestation of AD and other tauopathies, and facilitate the
development of novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of tau-based neurodegeneration."

 Progressive scarring of the lung interstitium is a common feature of many systemic and primary lung
diseases including Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a common disorder, and patients diagnosed with
this disorder experience substantial morbidity and a median survival of 3-5 years. Although recently approved
therapies slow the rate of disease progression, more efficacious interventions that interfere with precise
disease mechanisms are desperately needed. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) holds substantial
promise as a therapeutic target for lung fibrosis as experiments in multiple complementary animal models
reveal a direct correlation between the activity of this molecule and the severity of scarring. These studies
substantiate PAI-1 as a critical down-stream mediator of prominent pro-fibrotic stimuli including TGF-β and
matrix stiffness. Despite the large amount of data implicating PAI-1 as a critical pro-fibrotic protein, the
mechanism by which it promotes fibrosis remains elusive.
 PAI-1 is a multifunctional protein with inhibitory activity against the plasminogen activators through
which it regulates fibrinolysis and wound healing. PAI-1 also interacts with non-protease ligands including the
provisional matrix protein vitronectin (VTN). Using mutant proteins lacking specific functions and transgenic
mice, we demonstrated that the pro-fibrotic action of PAI-1 is largely independent of its plasminogen activator
inhibitory activity and that vitronectin is not required for PAI-1 to fully promote scarring of the lung. These
results led us to perform an unbiased proteomic study to identify novel PAI-1 binding partners within the injured
lung. With this approach, we identified sortilin related receptor-1 (SorlA) as the most enriched protein.
 SorlA is a multi-domain receptor implicated in the uptake and intracellular sorting of proteins. Our
preliminary data confirm that PAI-1 binds to SorlA and that this interaction is prevented by mutations that
suppress the profibrotic activity of PAI-1. We further find that PAI-1 is taken up by key cellular constituents of
the fibrotic lesion. Importantly, we also identify a previously unrecognized and potent role for SorlA in lung
fibrosis, and using human cells, we find that SorlA expression is upregulated in fibrotic epithelial cells and
fibroblasts. These preliminary data motivate our hypothesis that PAI-1 promotes lung fibrosis through an
interaction with SorlA that leads to cell uptake, cytosolic localization, and a profibrotic alteration in cell
phenotype. To interrogate this hypothesis, we have designed a multifaceted approach incorporating molecular
biology techniques, in vitro experiments with cells from patients and mice (as well as cell lines), and in vivo
experiments using transgenic mice, mutant PAI-1 proteins, and complementary models of lung fibrosis. To
accomplish our proposed studies, we have brought together a synergistic investigative team with expertise in
PAI-1, epithelial cell and fibroblast biology, and animal modeling, and the results from our studies promise to
elucidate previously unexplored mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets."

 Primary cilia are multisensory organelles that function as cellular antennae. We found that ciliary defects in
cholangiocytes and/or the loss of primary cilia are associated with biliary tract diseases like polycystic liver disease
(PLD) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). A better understanding of the signaling regulated by cilia and mechanisms
of ciliary loss in diseased cholangiocytes is critical to design new therapies based on the restoration of cilia, i.e.
ciliotherapies. Our current overall objective is to understand the role of cilia in the regulation of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. EGFR signaling is abnormally persistent and enhanced in PLD and CCA, two
diseases with ciliary dysfunction. Furthermore, we aim to explore the mechanisms of ciliary loss in cholangiocytes
– especially how the autophagy machinery is targeted to resorption of this organelle. This proposal will assess how
cilia-autophagy communication works in cholangiocytes to reduce ciliary expression and, consequently, how the
loss or dysfunction of cilia enhances EGFR signaling. We propose that pathologically-induced ciliophagy
accounts for ciliary loss/dysfunction, inducing sustained EGFR signaling. We propose three Specific Aims:
In Specific Aim 1: To characterize molecular mechanisms of the ciliary-dependent degradation of activated EGFR,
we will assess the need of cilia for activated EGFR degradation; characterize the mechanisms of EGFR
translocation to primary cilia; and assess the hypothesis that the E3 ubiquitin ligase c-CBL translocates to the
primary cilia upon EGF signaling and drives the degradation of activated EGFR located in the cilia. In Specific Aim
2: To identify the key players involved in targeting ciliary components to the autophagy machinery, we will assess
the role of autophagy and HDAC6/SIRT1 in ciliary expression in vitro; assess the role of HDAC6/SIRT1 in ciliophagy
in vivo; study the interaction between ciliary proteins and autophagy cargo receptors; and test the hypothesis that
in ciliary-defective cholangiocytes, overexpression of deacetylases induces lysine deacetylation of ciliary
components, which leads to ubiquitination of the same residues and targeting of the autophagy machinery by
specific autophagy cargo receptors. In Specific Aim 3: To test the combination of specific deacetylases,
autophagy, and EGFR inhibitors in pre-clinical rodent models as a therapeutic approach, we will assess the effect
of HDAC6 inhibition (Tubastatin-A or ACY-1215), and/or SIRT1 inhibition (Sirtinol) in combination with autophagy
inhibitors (e.g., HCQ, SAR405) with or without EGFR inhibition (Erlotinib, Afatinib) in vitro and in vivo; assess the
in vivo effects of Ciliomax (a novel dual inhibitor we recently developed) plus EGFR inhibition; and assess the most
promising treatments in patient-derived xenografts. Impact: identifying novel targets could lead to much-needed
new therapeutic strategies for these devastating diseases. Our experiments in in vitro and pre-clinical rodent
models will characterize the ciliary-dependent regulation of EGFR and the communication between primary cilia
and the autophagy process, which will lay the foundation for potential clinical trials."

High grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) the most common type of “ovarian” cancer is one of the deadliest
cancers diagnosed in women. One of the primary drivers for the high mortality rate associated with
HGSC is tumor recurrence and chemoresistance. Thus, there is a critical need to identify the genetic
drivers of tumor development and recurrence to improve therapeutic strategies. In this proposal, we
provide extensive evidence for the clinical and biological importance of miR181a, which is amplified in
a large majority of HGSC patients, correlates with poor overall survival, and induces epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, drug resistance, and stem-like cell properties. Remarkably,
this correlation between miR181a with clinical outcome and recurrence has also been shown in
numerous other cancers. Notably, miR181a expression in HGSC tumors offered stronger prognostic
value than established clinical biomarkers. Furthermore, analysis of >10,000 tumors representing 20
different cancers revealed that amplification of miR181a correlated with poor outcome. Most recently,
we have uncovered a novel mechanism through which miR181a can drive tumor development at the
earliest stage through the cooperative targeting of RB1 and Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING).
Enhanced miR181a promoted the growth of highly aggressive and genomically instable cells through
the direct inhibition of STING, a key activator of interferon signaling in response to cytoplasmic DNA.
Though activating anti-tumor immunity is increasingly being recognized as an important therapy in
cancer treatment the efficacy of current immunotherapies for the treatment of HGSC has not been
successful mainly due to the highly immunosuppressive microenvironment. One of the primary means
by which a tumor creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment is by inhibiting STING signaling
within the tumor. Thus, our novel finding showing that miR-181a directly regulates STING introduced
unique opportunity to assess whether therapeutic targeting of the miR-181a will reactivate IFN signaling
via STING to overcome immune tolerance that is commonly seen in HGSC tumors. We will interrogate
the cooperativity between miR181a and STING through the following aims: 1) Determine the effect of
miR181a loss on immune cell infiltration and IFN signaling using patient-derived organoids in the
presence and absence of either a STING agonist or anti-PDL1, 2) Ascertain the role of miR181a on
the sensitivity to STING agonist or anti-PDL1 in vivo, 3) Assess whether miR181a activation is sufficient
to drive tumor formation alone or in combination various combinations of tumor suppressor genes in
mice. Through these complementary studies, the goal is to characterize the mechanism by which
miR181a regulation of STING can re-engage the cytotoxic anti-viral signaling machinery in HGSC and
assess how miR181a is promoting tumor development."
10754288,"In cardiomyocytes, dyads are nanoscale structures formed by the juxtaposition of T-tubules, a network of tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane, and regions of the endoplasmic reticulum specialized for Ca2+ release, known as the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR). Dyads are positioned adjacent to Z-lines, such that sarcomere Z-lines, jSR, and T-tubules co-localize in a regular, transverse, linear pattern. Dyads mediate excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, which converts rapidly propagating plasma membrane electrical signals into coordinated Ca2+ transients throughout the cardiomyocyte, resulting in synchronized, forceful sarcomere contraction. A hallmark of failing cardiomyocytes is disorganization of dyads, which disrupts Ca2+ handling and results in decreased contraction and increased risk of arrhythmia.  The molecular mechanisms underlying dyad architecture and positioning have remained a mystery, despite their importance to heart homeostasis and disease. Our preliminary data establish a hierarchy for dyad formation in which a little studied protein, CMYA5, tethers jSR to sarcomere Z-lines, and T-tubules associate with jSR to form dyads. We further show that CMYA5 is required for normal dyad architecture, fidelity of E-C coupling, and regulation of RYR2 Ca2+ release activity. Mice lacking CMYA5 had dilated cardiomyopathy and were sensitized to develop severe cardiac dysfunction in response to pressure overload. In failing human hearts, loss of T-tubule and jSR organization were coupled to perturbed CMYA5 localization. Our studies establish CMYA5 as a novel entry point to study mechanisms responsible for dyad architecture and positioning adjacent to Z-lines, and implicate abnormalities of CMYA5-dependent mechanisms in the disorganization of dyads in human heart failure3–5, which contributes to heart failure pathogenesis.  Building on these novel observations, we will pursue the following Specific Aims to gain further insights into the function of CMYA5 in regulating CM Ca2+ release and E-C coupling: (1) Investigate CMYA5 regulation of RYR2 activity. We will test the hypothesis that CMYA5 interaction with RYR2 regulates RYR2 Ca2+ release by controlling RYR2 channel activity and RYR2 channel clustering. (2) Identify mechanisms by which CMYA5 tethers RYR2/jSR to Z-lines. We will test the hypothesis that CMYA5 anchors RYR2/jSR at Z-lines through interaction with currently unknown bridging proteins. (3) Evaluate contribution of CMYA5 mislocalization to dyad disruption in human and experimental heart disease. This proposal will reveal novel mechanisms responsible for the subcellular organization of dyads, hallmark nanostructures of CMs that are essential for normal E-C coupling. Elucidation of these mechanisms will provide insights into the mechanisms that perturb dyads in human heart failure, exacerbating contractile dysfunction and arrhythmia, and may lead to avenues to protect E-C coupling in inherited and acquired forms of heart disease."

Preconceptional and prenatal psychological stress, demographics, trauma, health, and nutrition all have potential
to alter offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. These aspects of the prenatal environment are hypothesized
to influence the developing fetal brain via stress-sensitive aspects of maternal-placental-fetal biology (MPF),
such as immune and endocrine functioning. However, previous research has centered around univariate
analyses that do not consider the wide array of preconceptional and prenatal factors with potential to influence
MPF biology and the developing fetal brain. Given the highly complex and interactive nature of these
relationships, multivariate analyses are well-suited to identify canonical patterns in high-dimensionality analyses
that may shed light on potential inflammatory mechanisms by which the preconceptional and prenatal
environment may influence offspring brain development. Inflammation may be best characterized by considering
multiple cytokines at once, as they appear to act co-dependently—cytokines that frequently work together to
communicate form cytokine networks. The use of cytokine networks has become an increasingly popular method
of conceptualizing and analyzing inflammation, given that specific cytokine networks are associated with certain
psychopathologies or heterogenous presentations of mental disorders. Further, specific cytokine networks
during pregnancy have been associated with altered offspring neurodevelopmental outcomes. Furthermore,
little to none of these studies have been reproduced in independent datasets. Given the increasing awareness
of limited reproducibility in neuroscience research, there has been an urgent push, spearheaded by the NIH,
towards rigorously designed experiments and increased reproducibility. The overall goal of the proposed
study is to examine how multiple preconceptional and prenatal factors affect maternal systemic
inflammation during pregnancy and associated alterations in offspring neurodevelopment, while
meeting the need for greater rigor and reproducibility in an innovative study design which will replicate
complex multivariate analyses across three high-dimensionality datasets. The specific aims of this
proposal are: 1) Identify maternal psychosocial contributors to the maternal inflammatory milieu during
pregnancy at a multivariate level; 2) Identify potent health indicators of the maternal inflammatory milieu during
pregnancy at a multivariate level; 3) Identify subgroups of participants with distinct patterns of maternal systemic
inflammation and examine potentially relevant interactions between health and psychosocial factors, as well as
neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with each cluster. This proposal intends to innovatively analyze
cytokine network activity as a potential pathway by which aspects of the preconceptional and prenatal
environment alter offspring neurodevelopment using multivariate statistical techniques. Additionally, given
frequent challenges with reproducibility in science, results from the analyses will be cross validated across three
independent datasets."

 Nitric oxide (NO) is an intercellular signaling molecule used across several kingdoms of life, and in animals,
NO is involved in key processes like vasodilation, neurotransmission, and the host response to infection. Central
to NO function in animal physiology is the metalloenzyme soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which generates the
secondary messenger guanosine 3’,5’-monophosphate (cGMP) in response to NO1,2. Because of its centrality
to several physiological processes in humans, sGC is a current therapeutic target3, and understanding the struc-
tural underpinnings of sGC activation will inform continued development. Though NO has only been proven to
bind at the heme cofactor, sGC activity has three distinct stages: 1) low basal activity without NO bound (NO-
free), 2) moderate activity (10-fold increase) with a single, heme-bound NO (1-NO), and 3) maximal activity (200-
fold increase) with excess NO4. Biochemical5 and structural6,7 experiments suggest NO allosterically regulates
sGC activation through elongation of a coiled-coil domain between the N-terminal NO-binding regulatory domain
and the C-terminal catalytic domain. However, interdomain arrangement and the conformational population dis-
tribution of the physiologically relevant 1-NO state remain to be fully explored. While metazoan sGCs exist as
heterodimers with only one heme-binding domain, the recently discovered single-celled eukaryotic Choanoeca
flexa (Cf) sGC is a homodimer that nonetheless exhibits half-sites heme-loading and 3-stage NO-activation8,9.
Through this proposed research, we will probe how Cf sGC allosterically modulates activity in response to NO
stimulation. Activity assays, homology-guided mutational studies, and a survey of small molecule stimulators will
be used to characterize Cf sGC activation. Cryo-electron microscopy will be used to determine high-resolution
structures of Cf sGC in active and inactive states, allowing for visualization of key structural similarities and
differences between Cf sGC and animal counterparts. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments will be
performed with both Cf sGC and animal sGCs to deconvolve the putative 3-stage NO-activation profile of sGC.
These experiments aim to identify and describe the structural states of Cf sGC and illuminate the structural
differences between ancestral and animal sGCs that define the evolutionary history of NO-based signaling."

 One in 8500 individuals are affected by myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common adult onset
muscular dystrophy. Those affected suffer from multisystemic symptoms affecting the brain, heart, and skeletal
muscle, which are active areas of investigation. DM1 patient surveys have identified gastrointestinal (GI)
disturbances as a predominant patient complaint that affects daily life and well-being and include difficulty
swallowing, pseudo-obstruction, and constipation. The cause of DM1 GI pathology is currently unknown and
evidence supports a role for visceral smooth muscle dysfunction. The goal of this proposal is to determine the
specific molecular mechanisms by which loss of MBNL function affects smooth muscle activity.
 DM1 is caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion, ranging between 50 to >4000 repeats, in the 3'
untranslated region of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. DM1 pathology results from a toxic
gain of function of the expanded DMPK RNA [(CUG)exp RNA]. (CUG)exp RNA sequesters and prevents activity of
the muscleblind-like (MBNL) family of RNA binding proteins that regulate postnatal RNA processing networks
and maintain adult RNA expression patterns. In DM1, loss of MBNL activity predominantly affects alternative
splicing, leading to the expression of fetal protein isoforms in adult tissues, causing disease features. The role
of two Mbnl paralogs in DM1 pathology is demonstrated by mouse Mbnl1 and/or Mbnl2 knockout (KO) that
recapitulate DM1 phenotypes in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. I am using tamoxifen inducible, conditional
double KO of Mbnl1 and Mbnl2 in mice to determine the impact of MBNL loss of function in visceral smooth
muscle. This will be the first investigation into the molecular mechanisms of DM1 GI features utilizing MBNL loss
as previously established for other DM1 affected tissues. The sponsor’s lab generated homozygous floxed Mbnl1
and Mbnl2 alleles that were combined with a smooth muscle specific CreERT2 (smoCRE;dHOM mice). Five-
week old smoCRE;dHOM mice exhibit delayed upper GI motility and known DM1-associated alternative splicing
events after Mbnl knock out. Optimized dKO mice will be used to: (1) determine what GI phenotypes result from
loss of MBNL, then (2) identify molecular mechanisms for smooth muscle dysfunction. In aim 1, lower GI motility
will be assessed by bead expulsion assays and ex vivo assays will identify perturbations of muscle contractility
and peristaltic patterning across intestinal segments. In aim 2, RNA sequencing data from both experimental
mice and tissues from DM1 affected individuals will be used to identify conserved alternative splicing events,
differentially expressed genes, and predominately affected gene ontologies. I anticipate identifying
transcriptomic changes affecting calcium dynamics and will perform in vitro investigations of calcium handling in
mouse primary smooth muscle cells and immortalized human smooth muscle cells. Together, these aims will
address the myogenic basis for DM1 GI pathogenesis and drive DM1 smooth muscle research forward."
10818524,"The current opioid epidemic highlights the need for a deeper understanding of how opioid receptors are
activated in our body. Our knowledge about the downstream events following opioid receptor activation comes
mainly from studies on opiates (e.g., morphine), synthetic drugs (e.g., fentanyl), and modified peptides (e.g.,
DAMGO). While these studies are important, the physiological ligands of the opioid receptors are endogenous
opioid peptides such as endorphins, enkephalins, and dynorphins. Over 20 different opioid peptides have been
identified in the brain, all of which activate the three types of opioid receptors (µOR, dOR, kOR) albeit with
different affinities and efficacies for G protein-mediated versus β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways. Thus,
endogenous opioid peptides show biased agonism, a property previously found for opiates and synthetic opioids.
Recent efforts to design safer opioid drugs were focused on optimizing G protein-mediated over β-arrestin-
mediated pathways. However, this is overly simplistic because respiratory depression and other negative side
effects of opioids have been shown to be G protein-dependent. Also, the model does not consider the possibility
that ligands can preferentially activate different subtypes of G proteins and downstream mediators. Another
factor that contributes to divergent signaling is agonist-mediated post endocytic signaling after receptor trafficking
to endosomes followed either by lysosomal degradation versus recycling to the cell surface. Because
endogenous opioid peptides are widely considered to be less toxic than opioid drugs, it is important to know the
signaling properties of these peptides in comparison to representative opioid drugs.
 In this application we describe studies to characterize signaling by opioid peptides at individual receptor
types. Based on preliminary data we hypothesize that “each opioid peptide exhibits a distinct signaling
profile at each receptor type resulting in the expansion of opioid receptor signaling repertoire”. To test
the hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will investigate the specific signaling pathways activated by individual opioid peptides
and compare them to a selected set of opioid drugs that range in addiction potential and toxicity. In Aim 2 we will
examine receptor trafficking and endosomal signaling upon activation by individual opioid peptides in comparison
with a selected set of opioid drugs. In both Aims we utilize a combination of classic and modern techniques to
study the effect of opioid peptides on cell lines expressing defined opioid receptors and signaling proteins,
followed by electrophysiological analysis of brain regions important for rewarding effects (ventral tegmental area)
and toxicity such as respiratory depression (the Kölliker Fuse nucleus). Together, these studies will broaden our
understanding of opioid receptor signaling in response to their biological ligands, laying the groundwork for safer
novel therapeutics for the treatment of pain, substance use disorders, and other disorders that involve the
endogenous opioid system."

The Montagna Symposium on the Biology of Skin has gathered nearly annually for 70 years with the goal of
bringing together leading scientists and clinical investigators in a uniquely designed conference to drive forward
the field of skin biology. Through cutting edge presentations and lively conversations in a laid back atmosphere
near Portland, Oregon, the conference serves and aims to: 1) Discuss new findings, techniques, and goals in
skin biology and adjacent fields; 2) Foster cross-disciplinary and innovative collaborations among disciplines that
will enrich the scientific and clinical specialty and bring novel solutions to bear on skin diseases; and 3)
Encourage young investigators to dream, imagine, and grow into the next generation of leading scientists and
dermatologists who can drive the field forward. Each year the Symposium addresses a different topic in skin
biology research and unanswered questions about causes and cures for skin diseases. Discoveries made in the
skin have enriched knowledge and treatment options in other organ systems for decades, as skin is the most
visible organ in the human body, presenting ample opportunities for its study. The unique atmosphere and limited
number of participants provides opportunity to debate controversies, propose solutions to puzzles and strategies
to overcome roadblocks, set new research agendas, and grasp opportunities for translation to new treatments.
Interactions are 1) Among participants in basic research, translational, clinical, patient care, disease-focused
foundation-led, and pharmaceutical researchers; 2) Between trainees and established scientists; and 3) Between
dermatology specialists and those from other departments/fields. Participation of young scientists is strongly
encouraged by presentation opportunities and competitive travel awards. The central support of this meeting is
a multi-year conference grant from the NIH that allows advance planning of program themes by leading Program
Chairs and invitation of highly competitive speakers. Annual fundraising from corporate and foundation sources,
together with modest registration fees, offset the balance of meeting production costs. The Symposium
communicates its findings to the broader academic community through annual publication of proffered, peer
reviewed papers in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology with waiver of submission fees under the Montagna
Symposium on the Biology of Skin logo. Topics planned and discussed in this proposal include the 70th
anniversary meeting “Visualizing the Future of Skin Biology and Dermatology”, “Skin of Color Dermatology: The
Interaction of Science and Society”, “Precision Dermatology”, “Resident Memory T Cells in Human Health and
Disease”, and “Innovative Technologies to Visualize and Diagnose the Skin”. We are thrilled to return to in-
person meetings following the disruptive COVID-19 pandemic and have renewed and increased our commitment
to gathering diverse researchers to elevate the meeting's discussions. This meeting uniquely fulfills the NIH goal
to advance scientific progress in understanding of the basic structure and molecular regulation of human biology
and disease and meeting themes have reflected and helped shape NIAMS' goals and mission."

 All new drug candidates must be tested for their potential to cause arrhythmia as a drug-induced
adverse event. Recent years have seen substantial progress in developing more sensitive and specific
predictions of which drugs may increase arrhythmia risk, and my group has been at the forefront of efforts to
employ mechanistic modeling for quantitative predictions of cardiac drug safety. Nonetheless, arrhythmias are
rare events, and even drugs that are considered dangerous only induce arrhythmias in a minority of patients.
Therefore, identifying which patients are most at risk of arrhythmia, and which conditions increase their risk,
is as important as classifying drugs. The work proposed here will address these challenging questions through
an innovative combination of: (1) in vitro physiology experiments that will quantify how drugs influence myocyte
action potentials and intracellular calcium; (2) simulations with mechanistic mathematical models that
incorporate phenotypic differences between groups and between individuals within the same group; and (3)
machine learning to synthesize results and develop predictive classification systems. Experiments performed
in stem cell-derived myocytes will measure cellular responses to a wide range of drugs, and these data will
allow for rigorous tuning of mathematical models. Subsequent simulations of heterogeneous populations will
address challenging unresolved questions, such as:
1. How do patient characteristics influence arrhythmia risk? Simulations will address how sex differences
in cardiac electrophysiology and the presence of pre-existing cardiac disease influence drug responses.
Through a combination of cellular experiments, mechanistic mathematical modeling of heart cells, and
machine learning models, we will quantify how much each factor influences arrhythmia risk.
2. How do symptoms associated with common diseases influence the potential pro-arrhythmic effects
of drugs used to treat those diseases? Many diseases are associated with conditions that influence cardiac
electrophysiology, such as fever, hypokalemia, and chronic inflammation. We will develop a simulation platform
that accounts for these effects.
3. Which patients within a group are especially at risk? Besides quantifying the effects of differences
between groups, our machine learning classifiers will allow us to predict which patients within a group are
especially susceptible to drug-induced arrhythmia on the basis of their “electrophysiological signatures.”
Together these studies will offer a new paradigm for quantitative understanding and prediction of drug-induced
arrhythmia that considers not only differences between drugs, but also between the patients that take these
drugs."

A new long-acting formulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) delivered by injection has been developed. Levonorgestrel (LNG) has a long history of clinical use in a variety of contraceptives (pills, intrauterine devices, and implants) and its efficacy and safety are well recognized.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for obese woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP) or so-called ""mini pill,"" which is used mainly by lactating women only for several months and requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. A long-acting injectable form of LB that is estrogen-free will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than a POP and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE especially for obese women. In order to provide preliminary evidence that LB could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN).

The proposed study will be conducted in women of reproductive age in order to evaluate pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms  of contraceptive  efficacy, and safety of this new contraceptive. The enrolled subjects will receive LB via intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of injection. The Recruitment will include enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI
>=32 kg/m2 but less than 40 kg/m2"

The current cancer treatment bottleneck showcases the need for more innovative approaches in drug discovery
efforts. As of recent, immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICHs) have shown promise in cancer therapeutics, and work
by manipulating immunoregulatory pathways involved in tumor detection and elimination. Many cancer types
overexpress the PD-L1 receptor to inhibit T cell activation and subsequently evade the immune response.
Though proven effective, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway targeting ICHs are pharmacologically limited by occupancy-
based inhibition. A new drug paradigm has emerged through the development of proteolysis targeting chimeras
(PROTACs) that are not limited by such a mechanism. PROTACs are heterobifunctional molecules consisting of
an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase ligand, a target protein warhead, and a linker connecting the two and work by bringing
an E3 Ub ligase and the target protein together through bivalent binding. The formation of a ternary structure
through this bivalent interaction drives the polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target via the
ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Although this drug design has shown great medicinal promise through
research findings and clinical trials, there is seldom literature on the use of transmembrane E3 Ub ligase
recruiting PROTACs to degrade cancer-promoting membrane proteins such as PD-L1. The proposed project
is aimed at investigating the applicability of such PD-L1 PROTACs by recruitment of the transmembrane
E3 Ub ligase ZNRF3. In doing so, three specific aims will be investigated: Aim 1. Identifying cyclic peptide
binders of the ZNRF3 extracellular domain. Previous research in the Liu lab utilized a cyanobenzothiazole based
linker that allows for cyclization of peptides on a phage surface with applications in phage selections against
CD44 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes. Recombinant bacterial expression of biotinylated ZNRF3 ECD
has been developed, and the binding of selected cyclic peptides will be validated through BLI and flow cytometry.
Aim 2. Synthesis and in-vitro characterization of PD-L1 PROTACs. Reported binders of PD-L1 will be
incorporated in the PROTAC design via polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyether linkages of varying lengths.
The optimal positioning of linkers will be determined through structure-activity relationships (SAR) analysis,
binding assays, co-cocrystal structures, and molecular docking studies of ligand-protein interactions of the
ZNRF3 ECD and PD-L1. Aim 3. In-vivo characterization of PD-L1 PROTACs. Degradation potency will be
evaluated with western-blotting of residual PD-L1 and ZNRF3 dependency on the induced degradation of PD-L1
and mode of action (proteosome vs lysosome) will be assessed. In addition, whole-cell proteomics studies will
be conducted to investigate any consequences on normal cellular activities due to PROTAC activity. By
accomplishing these aims, new and important conclusions can be made about the efficacy and mode of action
of our designed PROTACs that we hope will have a lasting impact on the cancer therapeutics bottleneck and
general drug discovery efforts."

Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the brain and are essential for neural circuit formation and neuron
function. Astrocytes have an indispensable role in the developing brain, yet our fundamental understanding of
how astrocytes develop trails our knowledge of neuron development. To develop, astrocytes must proliferate at
the proper time, genetically differentiate, and morphologically mature. Astrocyte dysfunction contributes to the
pathology of several neurodevelopmental disorders, yet these mechanisms are poorly understood. Both
neurons and astrocytes possess a primary cilium, a slender microtubule projection, that serves as a
specialized signaling center for the cell. Cilia are critical regulators of neuron development. However, despite
astrocytes having a primary cilium, the function of astrocyte cilia remains unknown. Disruptions to cilia result in
a class of disorders termed ciliopathies that often result in a spectrum of neurological abnormalities. We must
establish a fundamental understanding of astrocyte cilia because it is likely that they contribute to such
neurodevelopmental diseases. The goal of my research is to create foundational knowledge of the roles that
cilia play in astrocyte development. My preliminary data indicate that astrocyte cilia are necessary for several
stages of astrocyte development. Loss of astrocyte cilia results in altered proliferation, abnormal cellular
morphology, and disrupted expression of developmental astrocyte genes. Therefore, I hypothesize that
astrocyte cilia are critical to regulate astrocyte proliferation and differentiation. This project aims to 1) determine
how cilia regulate astrocyte proliferation and 2) define the role of cilia in astrocyte differentiation. I will use
mouse models to genetically ablate cilia at distinct timepoints, specifically in astrocytes, to investigate the
requirements of cilia at different stages of astrocyte development. I will determine whether cilia regulate the
timing and rate of astrocyte proliferation. Then, to further define how cilia regulate proliferation, I will monitor
cell cycle progression. Next, I will define whether cilia are required for astrocyte differentiation by conducting a
morphological analysis of astrocyte size, spacing, and branching features. Finally, I will conduct a
transcriptomics analysis to determine whether cilia regulate the genetic program of developing astrocytes. I will
also examine astrocyte transcriptional expression at the cellular level to define whether cilia impact
differentiation in specific populations of cortical astrocytes. The proposed experiments will reveal novel
functions of astrocyte cilia and establish a foundation for the roles of ciliary signaling in astrocyte development.
This work will increase fundamental knowledge about astrocyte cilia and how astrocytes develop to improve
our understanding of astrocyte contribution to neurodevelopmental diseases."

 Autoimmune uveitis is a debilitating and potentially blinding inflammatory disease that affects 93 in
100,000 Americans annually. The current treatment strategy is to control the inflammation with
immunosuppressive medication that include steroids, which in turn have serious side effects, such as
cataracts, glaucoma, peptic ulcers, bone decalcification, and systemic susceptibility to infection. A mouse
model of human autoimmune uveitis, experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) has been used to better
understand this disease. In contrast to chronic human uveitis, EAU resolves without intervention and mice are
resistant to recrudescence of uveitis because of regulatory immunity found in the spleen. This regulatory
immunity requires post-EAU Treg cells to be activated by post-EAU antigen presenting cells (APC). We have
shown that the melanocortin 5 receptor (MC5r) is required for the emergence of a regulatory APC in the post-
EAU spleen, and this regulatory APC is a source of adenosine that activates the post-EAU Treg cell through
the adenosine 2A receptor (A2Ar). This is an interesting finding, because these two pathways have been
shown to individually regulate immunity, but our observation is the first to link the two pathways. The result of
stimulating this melanocortin-adenosinergic pathway is an autoantigen specific Treg cell that suppresses EAU.
We have observed A2Ar-dependent Tregs emerge in the eye at the onset of EAU, persist through resolution,
and expand in an A2Ar-dependent manner following EAU-reimmunization. Therefore, how these A2Ar-
dependent ocular resident Tregs prevent relapse and the mechanism of A2Ar dependency will be answered
(Aim 1). We have identified distinct A2Ar-dependent T cell Immunoglobulin and ITIM (TIGIT) TIGIT+ and PD-1+
post-EAU Treg subsets in the spleen. How these distinct Treg subsets are induced, how they suppress EAU,
and if each subset has a different activation requirement in uveitis patients will be investigated (Aim 2). The
post-EAU Treg cells express CCR7 that homes to secondary lymphoid tissue and CCR6 that homes to the
eye, these Tregs are found in both tissue sites when reactivated, and expression of CCR6 and CCR7 induced
through stimulation of the adenosinergic-melanocortin pathway on PBMC from uveitis patients is significantly
reduced compared to healthy controls. Where and how the adenosinergic-melanocortin induced post-EAU
Treg cells home to suppress uveitis will be investigated (Aim 3). Our hypothesis is that the melanocortin-
adenosinergic pathway induces effective and long-term regulatory immunity that provides resistance to
autoimmune uveitis. We propose to combine murine studies with translational studies to answer important
mechanistic questions about ocular autoantigen specific Treg cells with the long-term goal of bringing these
findings into the clinic to develop a uveitis treatment that provides lasting remission."

N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels composed of transmembrane
GluN1, GluN2 (A-D), and GluN3 (A-B) subunits that mediate Ca2+ influx into the dendritic spine. Importantly, the
unique intracellular tail of the GluN2B subunit is essential for learning and memory. Furthermore, autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) associated variants are found within the GluN2B intracellular
tail. My overall goal is to elucidate a novel mechanism by which GluN2B tails contribute to the function of GluN2B-
containing NMDARs (GluN2B-NMDARs). Previous experiments showed that actin-targeting drugs impact
NMDAR activity, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. My preliminary data strongly support the
primary hypothesis of this project: a direct interaction between actin filaments and the GluN2B
intracellular tail regulates NMDAR activity. The objective of my proposed project is to elucidate the
biochemical basis for an interaction between the GluN2B tail and actin filaments and determining how this
interaction regulates NMDAR function. I will achieve this objective by pursuing three highly complementary aims:
Aim 1. Define the minimal fragment of GluN2B intracellular tail that mediates high affinity binding to actin
filaments and the interfaces on GluN2B and actin that mediate binding. My preliminary data show a direct
interaction between GluN2B tails and actin, but the key interfaces that mediate this interaction between the
proteins is unknown. I will use recombinant proteins to perform quantitative binding assays and cross-linking
assays to identify the minimal fragment of the GluN2B tail needed to mediate a high affinity interaction with actin.
Aim 2. Characterize how Ca2+ and genetic variants impact GluN2B:actin binding. Ca2+ decreases NMDAR
activity in cultured hippocampal neurons, but whether Ca2+ selectively impacts GluN2B-NMDAR activity is
unknown. My preliminary data suggest Ca2+ strengthens the GluN2B tail:actin interaction. Genetic variants that
lie within GluN2B tail regions that I found bind actin have been identified in patients with ASD and SCZ. Clusters
of conserved and positively charged residues can contribute to actin binding of proteins. I will perform quantitative
binding assays to identify how Ca2+ levels, disease-associated variants, and clusters of conserved and positive
residues impact the GluN2B tail:actin interaction.
Aim 3: Determine how manipulations of the actin cytoskeleton and GluN2B tail impact GluN2B-NMDAR
activity. Changes in actin polymer state impact NMDAR activity in neurons. However, whether actin selectively
impacts GluN2B-NMDARs or is mediated by GluN2B tail:actin interactions is unclear. I will monitor changes in
GluN2B-NMDAR mediated currents in HEK293 cells to determine the impact of 1) actin-targeting drugs and 2)
disrupting the GluN2B tail:actin interaction. After mastering these techniques, I will monitor how actin dynamics
and GluN2B tail:actin interactions impact NMDAR activity in cultured hippocampal neurons."

Changes to synaptic architecture underlie the cellular basis for learning and memory and
impaired synaptic function and plasticity are observed in numerous brain diseases and
disorders including epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. The synthesis and precise delivery of
AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) to the postsynaptic membrane is a critical
mechanism for proper basal synaptic function and plasticity. How new receptors are delivered to
specific synapses and how receptor trafficking is influenced by neural activity remain important
questions. A major limitation for addressing these questions is the current reliance on non-
physiological, overexpressed receptors to study neuronal synaptic protein trafficking pathways.
To overcome this hurdle, I have developed and validated a new toolkit that allows me to label
endogenous AMPARs and control their trafficking. I propose to leverage these new tools to
investigate where, when, and how new AMPARs are delivered to specific synapses under basal
conditions and following diverse forms of synaptic plasticity."
10818367,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 A long-term goal is to bring small molecules to biologists and chemical biologists, developing easy-to-use
tools and libraries that rapidly identify reagents. A second goal uses these libraries and tools to predict
biological activity for key compound classes, advancing the science and demonstrating proof-of-concept.
 The tools introduced by this research program have become central to virtual screening. The ZINC database
is the most widely used compound library in the field, while our DUD and DUD-E benchmarks are ubiquitous in
virtual screening. Recently, our development of ultra-large libraries has been embraced by the field. The
Similarity Ensemble Approach (SEA) brings chemoinformatic target prediction to a large community, and we
have used it to predict drug off-targets, their side effects, and the activities of supposedly inert molecules.
Here we extend both projects, further developing community libraries and tools in aim 1, applying these to the
prediction of biological activities in aim 2. The specific aims are:
 Aim 1. New tools to bring chemistry to biology. An exciting result of the last period was the introduction of
ultra-large libraries. While an accessible library of >20 billion molecules has expanded our horizons, the two
component reactions from which they derive are inevitably limiting. We will A. develop a “chemistry commons”
of more elaborate virtual molecules available from academic labs, testing them in aim 2, B. expand the
chemistry available for covalent docking to develop new community-accessible libraries of selective
electrophiles for covalent inhibitor discovery, C. We will optimize the widely-used DUDE benchmarks,
introducing new subsets to address the biases that they certainly still retain. D. We will integrate into ZINC
methods that enable similarity searches for analogs in sublinear time.
 Aim 2. Libraries of high value compounds, and their activities. We will A. test the utility of more elaborate
virtual libraries from aim 1 where they are experimentally tested, B. test the new covalent electrophilic libraries
in docking campaigns against SARS-2 relevant proteases 3CLPro and TMPRSS2. C. expand our interest in
target discovery by chemoinformatics, focusing on compounds that are widely used in biology because they
are inactive: drug excipients and Generally Regarded As Safe food additives. D. ask whether GRAS
molecules have on-target pharmacology, as we found with drug excipients, testing our predictions
experimentally.
 Whereas these goals are ambitious, extensive preliminary results support their feasibility."
10841483,"PROJECT SUMMARY (DESCRIPTION)
Deleterious mutations are ubiquitous in genomes. However, the manner in which they impact evolution and
complex traits remains unclear. My laboratory has focused on understanding the role of deleterious mutations
in evolution by combining polymorphism data from multiple species with population genetic models. During the
previous funding period, we have developed tools to infer the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) and domi-
nance coefficients from polymorphism data in natural populations and made several discoveries as to how pu-
rifying selection acts in different species. In particular, we have learned from our recent work that the DFE and
selection coefficients at individual mutations differ across species, many deleterious mutations are recessive,
the fate of deleterious mutations in populations and their effects on genome variation heavily depend on specif-
ic demographic and biological parameters, strongly deleterious recessive mutations determine the fitness of a
population on short timescales more than weakly deleterious mutations do, and deleterious mutations contrib-
ute to poor transferability of genetic risk prediction between populations. Despite this progress, critical gaps in
knowledge remain. Much of the existing work on deleterious variation has focused on single nucleotide muta-
tions in coding regions in a limited subset of species. Further, there has been limited work on testing the ex-
planatory power of inferred model parameters. Here we propose to expand our knowledge of deleterious varia-
tion across genomes by addressing five new questions. First, we will combine large-scale functional genomic
data with polymorphism data to infer a DFE for noncoding regulatory mutations, which is vital for understanding
complex traits as the vast majority of disease-associated mutations are non-coding variants. Second, we will
develop new computational approaches to infer a DFE for complex mutations, such as short tandem repeats
and copy number variants. These new methods and inferences will enable direct quantitative comparison of
the fitness effects of different types of mutations in different parts of the genome. Third, by combining polymor-
phism data from multiple species with different population sizes, complexity, and lifespan, we will test how the-
se factors influence the DFE over evolutionary time. Fourth, we will use both human polymorphism data as well
as yeast functional genomic data to test our previously developed model for the existence of dominance. Final-
ly, we will use detailed forward simulations to establish whether state-of-the-art population genetic models of
multiple evolutionary forces occurring simultaneously can explain genetic variation across genomes. Success-
ful completion of this research will paint a more complete picture of how evolutionary processes influence ge-
netic variation and the causes and consequences of deleterious variation."

The future of Neuroscience must include representation of all people; such diversity is crucial to fuel the
innovation required to meet current scientific and healthcare challenges facing neuroscientists. In response to
RFA-NS-22-035, we propose a Doctoral Readiness training program – the Iowa Diversifying Research And
Mentorship (iDREAM) program. The iDREAM program leverages the power of (1) an outstanding
Neuroscience Graduate Program with long-running T32 support (JSPTPN), and (2) a strong institutional unit,
the Iowa Neuroscience Institute, which supports rigorous culturally aware faculty development and will provide
crucial administrative support for iDREAM. We have formed a compelling MPI leadership plan with a blend of
experience, skills sets, and energy. We will train four iDREAM post-bac scholars per year, for two years each,
drawn from a large pool of applicants from backgrounds underrepresented in Neuroscience and schools
without substantial research opportunities. Our Neuroscience Graduate Program is regularly composed of
>20% URM students and has a stellar track record of training future tenure-track faculty (>50%). iDREAM
scholars will be introduced to Neuroscience research via high-quality, hands-on research experiences in the
laboratories of carefully selected preceptors with manifest commitments to the iDREAM mission. Scholars will
receive rigorous training in the responsible conduct of research, evidence-based didactic training in the critical
thinking and communication skills necessary for a successful research career, and programmatic experiences
designed to cultivate an inclusive environment and sense of belonging within the local and global
Neuroscience communities. iDREAM scholars will partner with grad students in the Neuroscience Program for
near-peer mentorship experiences. Faculty research mentors are 28 well-funded neuroscientists with culturally
aware mentorship training and experience, who reflect the spectrum of gender, background, rank, and
neuroscience research topics and approaches. The mentors will be matched with trainees through a guided
interview process with careful oversight from the MPIs and Executive Committee. iDREAM scholars will attend
career development workshops, weekly scientific seminars and laboratory meetings, and present their
research at multiple local and one national meeting per year. iDREAM scholars will also be guided through all
aspects of the graduate school application process. Long term goals of the program include: 1) empowering
URM post-bac trainees to be competitive at rigorous, top-tier graduate programs in Neuroscience (including at
Iowa) and to lead successful scientific careers; 2) catalyzing progress of enhancing inclusive excellence within
the Neuroscience community at Iowa and beyond; and 3) reinforcing and strengthening existing partnerships
between the Neuroscience community at Iowa and schools without substantial research opportunities. Metrics
of success include the number of participants who apply for and are accepted in a rigorous neuroscience
graduate program, and students reporting a strong sense of belonging in the Neuroscience community."

Over the last 15 years, several laboratories, including my laboratory, have identified multiple signaling pathways
that regulate translation via the translation initiation factors eIF4E and eIF2α during protein synthesis-dependent
forms of long-lasting synaptic plasticity and various memory processes in rodents, including the consolidation,
reconsolidation, and extinction of auditory and contextual threat memory. These findings have generated much
excitement because they demonstrate the complex biochemical regulation of translation during synaptic plasticity
and memory. Despite this progress, a number of critical and unresolved questions regarding the requirement for
de novo protein synthesis in memory consolidation remain unanswered. We plan to focus on auditory and
contextual threat memory to determine the cell types in the amygdala and hippocampus, respectively, that
require eIF4E- and eIF2α-dependent translation for memory consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction, and
discrimination. We also plan to examine the cell type-specific requirement for de novo translation in memory

Dysregulated translation has been shown by a number of laboratories, including my laboratory, to contribute to
synaptic dysfunction and aberrant behaviors in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
and neurodevelopmental disorders such as fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
However, using molecular approaches to dissect circuit dysfunction in these diseases/disorders has been
lacking. Therefore, we plan to examine the role of cell type-specific translational dysregulation in mouse models
of AD, FXS, and ASD. Moreover, we will identify the inappropriately translated mRNAs and their newly
synthesized protein products using translatomic and de novo proteomic approaches that we developed to identify
mRNAs/proteins that are translated/synthesized improperly in mouse models of AD and FXS.
These questions will be addressed by utilizing the powerful multidisciplinary combination of new groundbreaking
genetically-engineered mice and viruses, electrophysiological recordings, immuno-cytochemistry, innovative
methods to measure de novo protein synthesis in vivo, cell-type specific translational profiling, and de novo
proteomics. The results of these studies will provide fundamental insights into the molecular events in both
excitatory and inhibitory neurons that support consolidation, reconsolidation, and extinction of memory.
Moreover, these studies have the potential to provide therapeutic targets for multiple brain disorders that are
associated with dysregulated translation."

Treatment advances in psychosis are limited by the use of phenomenology-defined diagnoses based on
symptomatic outcomes, rather than by neurobiological constructs monitored by quantitative characteristics.
The Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (B-SNIP) uses biomarkers to define
psychosis subgroups with the goal of testing the advantages of B-SNIP biomarkers for diagnostic and
therapeutic decisions, consistent with principles in the NIMH Strategic Plan (NSP). With >3000 phenotyped
psychosis probands, relatives and healthy controls (HC), B-SNIP has a multilevel biomarker library for
psychosis and used that library to re-conceptualize psychosis subgroups as biomarker-defined Biotypes (B1,
B2, B3), where B1 and B2 are the low cognition/high symptom groups and B3 shows lower symptoms and
relatively normal cognition. We replicated Biotypes in a new sample, “forging a future where measures of an
individual's … neural and physiological state will form the basis of an increasingly specific and informative
diagnosis” (NSP). In this grant we propose that B1, with its low cognition and low cortical activity, will respond
uniquely to clozapine, a drug which will generate active cortical attractor networks in B1 to support
symptomatic improvement.
Clozapine is the most effective antipsychotic drug (APD) with unique clinical efficacy. It is the least used APD
because its side effects are serious (neutropenia, myocarditis, seizures) and its administration complex. A
predictive biomarker would allow targeting of cases most likely to respond and improve prognosis in psychosis.
B-SNIP has shown that clozapine is associated with increases in EEG measures of alpha/theta power, and we
identify this increase in time periods without stimulus processing requirements as intrinsic EEG activity (IEA),
across all Biotypes. Because B1 cases express low IEA, clozapine's action to increase EEG power will be
normalizing for this psychosis subgroup, with increased cortical attractor states. Because B2 express
accentuated IEA, clozapine is associated with more deviant IEA in B2. We propose to test B1 psychosis cases
with clozapine vs. risperidone (n=40/group clinical trial completers), over a 6 week cross-titration (to
therapeutic plasma levels) and a 9 week stable dose extension, predicting that the B1/clozapine group will
respond significantly better, as measured with total PANSS, than the B1/risperidone group and also better than
either B2 group. It is our hypothesis that the cortical attractor networks will be normalized and their function
increased by the increase in intrinsic EEG activity."
10827507,"Despite decades-long research and multiple trials, there is no licensed vaccine against Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
yet, urging efforts to better understand its transmission dynamics. CMV is a frequent cause of tissue-invasive
disease in infants and immunocompromised individuals, and transmission happens easily and through contact
with various body fluids. Among transmission modes, CMV transmission via human milk (HM) is recognized to
have the largest global impact on population prevalence. Factors determining CMV transmission remain largely
unknown, including CMV interactions with HM microbiota and metabolites. In general, commensal microbiota
can greatly impact sensitivity to viral infections while, metabolites, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs),
not only feed human microbiota but can also act as soluble decoy receptors, blocking the attachment of viral
pathogens to epithelial cells. Additionally, short chain and medium chain fatty acids are products of microbial
fermentation, known to influence immune responses, and microbiota can also produce antivirals through
secondary metabolism. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to better define CMV transmission dynamics,
considering different factors and timescales, and to systematically and quantitatively study the role and
interactions of the HM metabolome and microbiome influencing CMV transmission from women to their infants.
Our preliminary data readily shows that CMV seronegative and seropositive mothers have distinct HM
microbiome and metabolome ecologies. In particular, we found clear differences distinguishing seropositive
mothers that are non-shedding, shedding but not transmitting, and shedding and transmitting CMV. These results
led to the central hypothesis, which is that certain combinations of HM microbiota and metabolites prevent CMV
transmissions, and that these combinations vary among individual dyads, but follow traceable and reproducible
patterns. We propose to test the central hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) Determine
CMV transmission dynamics with high sample density and HM microbiome ecologies underlying CMV
transmission versus non-transmission; (2) Identify and validate key metabolites involved in CMV transmission
and non-transmission; and (3) Define causality and identify molecular mechanisms of CMV transmission
inhibition assisted by mathematical modeling and artificial intelligence. Collectively, our proposed research will
broadly impact the field by elucidating CMV-host interactions and CMV transmission dynamics in various time
scales, validating factors blocking CMV transmission, and providing models and tools to help advance the arrival
of clinical resource. These studies also have the potential to lay the groundwork for, and translate into, rational
design of personalized HM and microbiome-metabolome interventions without replacing HM."

The large number of disease susceptibility loci identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is
enabling polygenic risk scores (PRS) to deliver on their promise to improve health outcomes and to transform
the practice of personalized medicine. The reduced quality of PRS for common diseases and related
quantitative traits for populations of recent African, Asian, and Native American ancestries relative to those for
populations of recent European ancestries, however, threatens to create a new class of disparities in the
delivery of healthcare based on PRS. The number of individuals of non-European ancestry with genome
interrogation are growing much more rapidly now than 5 years ago; nevertheless, the number of individuals of
recent European ancestries with genome interrogation grows still more rapidly and it is likely to be many years
before sample sizes for genome interrogation in even major continental groups are close to proportional to
relative population sizes. Thus, it is critical to optimize PRS performance for diverse populations in as
many ways as we can. Given the substantial and growing fraction of the US population with genomes
admixed from different continental ancestries, we believe that high quality PRS for much of the US population
is unlikely to be achieved without properly accounting for local ancestries. Similarly, focused strategies to
identify high-impact but population-specific variants could improve the quality of PRS in populations with such
alleles. DNA variants from regions with a signature of natural selection often demonstrate such properties, and
have been shown to be enriched among top associations for a number of hematological and
immune/inflammatory traits that are important biomarkers for key chronic diseases. We propose to focus our
PRS studies on hematological and immune/inflammatory traits and their associated chronic diseases and to
extend methods for the development of PRS to accommodate estimates of local ancestry, high impact
population-specific variants and multiple endophenotypes. Thus, our Specific Aims are: 1) Assemble and
harmonize data sets needed to accomplish the goals of the project, including hematological traits (red
blood cell, white blood cell, platelet), and immune/inflammatory traits (CRP, fibrinogen, D-dimer) from: Jackson
Heart Study, Women’s Health Initiative, BioVU, and GeneSTAR. 2) Extend PRS methods to: a) explicitly
model local ancestry; b) accommodate large-effect but population-specific risk alleles (such as those
from regions with a signature of natural selection); and c) enable joint modeling of multiple
endophenotypes; and 3) Develop and apply novel PRS and overall disease prediction models to: a)
estimate risk of common diseases and related biomarkers affected by hematological, thrombotic and
immune/inflammatory biology; and b) enable calculation of PRS-adjusted clinical laboratory values to
reduce structural health disparities."

and implemented it for high-content, high-throughput imaging. We have used this model in a pilot screen
and validated its utility to identify novel compounds that modulate mutant TPI protein levels in human cells.
We propose to develop the assay to full HTS standards, conduct a screen of several relevant compound
libraries, and identify first-in-class TPI Df small molecule therapies. We will validate hits in secondary
assays for TPI stability and activity in TPI Df patient cells, prioritize them in a panel of in vitro toxicology

substantially validate them in vivo using a recently developed mouse TPI Df model. Overall this project will

Prostate cancer (PCa) incidence is highest in African Americans and lowest in Asians. These long-standing
racial/ethnic differences have yet to be explained. Genome-wide association studies of PCa have provided
support for common and population-specific genetic effects for PCa and for a genetic basis of the underlying
population differences in risk. To further progress in understanding the genetic basis of PCa across populations,
we propose to substantially augment the size of genetic association studies in men of European, African, Asian
and Latino ancestry to create the largest genetic database of PCa ever assembled in these populations, with
substantially greater statistical power for novel discovery of risk alleles for PCa as well as aggressive disease.
More specifically, we will expand studies in men of African ancestry from 10,368 cases and 10,986 controls to
34,000 cases and 74,000 controls, in men of Asian ancestry from 8,610 cases and 18,809 controls to 20,000
cases and 40,000 controls, in men of Latino ancestry from 2,714 cases and 5,239 controls to 10,000 cases and
20,000 controls, and in men of European ancestry from 82,000 cases and 61,000 controls to 117,000 cases and
517,000 controls, with all studies imputed to a multiethnic whole-genome sequence reference panel (e.g.
TOPMed). In Aim 1, we will search for novel common risk alleles for overall and aggressive PCa in ethnic-specific
and multiethnic analyses. Within known and newly discovered risk regions, we will conduct multiethnic fine-
mapping using novel Bayesian statistical approaches that incorporate functional annotations and biology with
statistical evidence to identify independent markers of risk as well as the most promising functional candidates.
In Aim 2, we will create the first multiethnic genome-wide SNP-eQTL prostate reference panel for men of
European, African, Asian and Latino ancestry using whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing of ~1,000
histologically normal, fresh-frozen prostate tissue specimens. We will characterize eQTLs in the sample and
impute gene expression in men of European, African, Asian, and Latino ancestry to perform a multiethnic
transcriptome-wide association scan (TWAS). In Aim 3, we will construct and evaluate a polygenic risk score
(PRS) across populations, using known and novel risk variants from Aim 1 and TWAS loci from Aim 2. PRS
validation testing will be conducted in three independent multiethnic cohorts (>38,000 PCa cases from ATLAS,
All of Us and CCPM). We expect findings from this study will make a major contribution to our understanding of
genetic susceptibility to PCa and lead to better risk models that more accurately predict a man's risk of
developing PCa and are efficacious across racial/ethnic populations."

occurs when thyroid tumor cells lose their innate ability to take up and concentrate RAI. Recent clinical studies
have shown that kinase inhibitors and other drugs can reverse this effect by redifferentiating refractory tumor
cells, thus restoring the cellular machinery required to concentrate RAI. However, this redifferentiation strategy
remains challenging to optimize and deploy clinically. The reasons for this include the small number of patients
eligible, the heterogeneity of the disease, the toxicity of targeted kinase therapies, and the lack of robust
biomarkers. This project will develop papillary thyroid carcinoma organoids to study and individualize the use of
redifferentiation agents to restore RAI uptake in RAI-refractory patients. In the first Aim, we develop a novel
automated and high-throughput assay to measure RAI uptake in thousands of tumor organoid cultures. The
assay will be optimized to achieve specific performance goals, including throughput, linearity, limit of detection,
and reproducibility. In the second Aim, we will demonstrate the assay in a small pilot study of 10 patients. The
panel of tumor organoids, which will include both RAI-sensitive and refractory disease, will be used to screen a
library of relevant drugs on the basis of RAI uptake. Using the approach, we will optimize dosing and scheduling
of the treatments towards the eventual goal of individualizing therapy to maximize efficacy while minimizing the
adverse side effects of kinase inhibitors."

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide at 3.23 million
(2019), while nearly 400 million suffer its effects. COPD is a heterogeneous, multi-phenotypic disease with lung
damage derived from smoking, vaping, cooking, forest fires, pollution, chemical exposure, and numerous
occupational hazards (e.g., 1st responders, military, agricultural and industrial workers). The most common form
of COPD is chronic bronchitis, which is associated with mucus hypersecretion that results in greatly reduced
lung function leading to a decreased quality of life.
Current treatments for COPD largely treat symptoms without meaningfully altering the course of the disease.
There are currently no truly disease-modifying treatments available for COPD patients. Different families
of proteases have been implicated in COPD. Recently, a specific protease has been shown to be upregulated
in lung epithelial cells and macrophages, and its expression in these cells correlates directly with disease severity
in human COPD patients. The target is a pleiotropic membrane bound protein that processes cytokines, growth
factors, receptors, and receptor ligands on the cell surface. Verra Therapeutics has developed a soluble protein
inhibitor, VTH245, that selectively inhibits the proteolytic activity and blocks deleterious activities in models of
COPD. This innovative protein inhibitor has significant advantages in specificity (compared to small molecule
inhibitors), penetration (smaller than monoclonal antibodies), and immunogenicity (based on a naturally
occurring protein sequence). Data generated in our Phase I project have demonstrated that VTH245 treatment
in a gold-standard mouse model of cigarette smoke-induced COPD 1) significantly reduced biomarkers of lung
inflammation and destruction; 2) reduced inflammatory cell counts in the lung lavage to near-air levels; and 3)
reduced mucus hypersecretion. Further, these results matched or exceeded performance of the marketed drug,
roflumilast. While roflumilast treatment is commonly associated with a range of toxicities that limit its use, VTH245
was well tolerated and displayed the highest survival rate over 6-months (20/20 animals). This Phase II SBIR
project will extend our findings from Phase I and provide key IND-enabling safety data to inform future first-in-
human studies through the execution of the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To identify the preferred route of
administration for VTH245 for treating COPD by comparing the efficacy provided by two clinically relevant
routes of administration, subcutaneous and inhaled, determining a single route for use in toxicity studies in Aim
3; Aim 2: To perform critical CMC activities for VTH245 process development and generate high quality
VT245 for use in toxicity evaluations in Aim 3; and Aim 3: To generate a preliminary safety profile of VTH245
to support IND approval. Successful completion of the Phase II program will further define the target product
profile for VTH245 and provide critical data for an IND submission to support a clinical development program."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects 1 in 54 children in the US (1). The
economic cost of ASD is estimated to be $66 billion per year in the US, from medical care and lost parental
productivity (2). Early diagnosis is crucial since it allows for early treatment and the best long-term outcome.
However, identifying children at high risk for ASD at an early age is challenging due to lack of specialists. To
address this problem, the project's objective is to create health information technology (HIT) using information
in electronic health records (EHR) to support non-expert clinicians in identifying children at high risk for ASD.
The HIT will integrate two components that provide complementary information. The first component will
leverage machine learning algorithms to label EHR of children at high risk for autism. Both traditional and deep
learning, potentially leveraging each other, will be evaluated while systematically tracking quality and quantity
of information in EHR and their effect on performance. The second component will focus on the EHR free text
and identify phenotypic behavioral expressions of diagnostic criteria as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Rule-based natural language processing will be combined with machine
learning algorithms. For both components, potential algorithm bias will be investigated and corrected or
documented when this is not possible. The HIT will combine results from both components through an intuitive
user interface. Since it is intended to be used as a human-in-the loop decision tool, it will also provide
descriptive data on performance for both components. The final HIT will be developed using rapid prototyping
in interaction with domain experts. It will be evaluated in a user study with representative non-expert clinicians.
The evaluation will compare accuracy, confidence, and efficiency of identifying children at risk for ASD with
and without the HIT by non-ASD experts. It will also systematically focus on the type, amount, quality and
transparency of information provided, and how this interacts with user beliefs about their own expertise as well
as their bias toward machine decisions. Different types of EHR as well as different levels of clinical expertise
will be compared for effects of HIT use.
Preliminary work has been conducted for all components with good results. However, this prior work focused
on version IV of the DSM and used only free text from data rich EHR. The proposed project will expand the
prior work to use DSM-5 criteria, train and develop the algorithms to use structured and unstructured fields in
clinical, representative EHR, and work with EHR from different hospitals to evaluate potential obstacles and
advantages of variability in data.
Using information in EHR, this HIT will provide support especially for non-expert clinicians in their evaluation of
children who may be at risk of ASD. The HIT will support early referrals leading to early diagnosis and therapy.
It will be useful in a variety of different settings where domain expertise is missing."

Determining the function of genes is fundamental for understanding vertebrate development, regulatory
mechanisms and human diseases. Genome editing technologies, such CRISPR-Cas9, have allowed associating
specific phenotypes to permanent gene alteration. However, some key technical and conceptual issues remain
problematic in vertebrates, particularly in aquatic model organisms such zebrafish. For example, the maternally
provided mRNA can rescue the phenotype of homozygous mutants; genotyping steps are tedious; and long non-
coding RNA, lethal or tissue/temporal genes are difficult to study using DNA manipulation as well as complex
genomic loci. Complementary ‘knock-down’ approaches are invaluable tools to circumvent some of these
problems, however, there was no systematic tool to knockdown mRNAs in zebrafish or other teleost fish.
Our long-term goal is to unravel the function of genes related to regulatory mechanisms, development, and
human diseases. Our recent publication demonstrates that injection of the CRISPR-RfxCas13d system into
vertebrate embryos provides a robust and cost-effective technology to systematically disrupt gene function.
However, the injection of this system only provides transient knockdown for ~3 days. Therefore, the central goal
of the proposal is to transfer the CRISPR-RfxCas13d technology from being injected into vertebrate embryos, to
being endogenously expressed through transgenesis. We propose that the development of a repertoire
transgenic zebrafish expressing the RfxCas13d enzyme (ubiquitous and tissues-specific) and guideRNA would
facilitate rapid and vigorous investigation into gene functions. Our preliminary data indicate that transgenic
expression of RfxCas13d in zebrafish is functional and not toxic. The objectives are: 1) Define the optimal system
to knockdown mRNA expression in CRISPR-RfxCas13d transgenic zebrafish. 2) Knockdown mRNA expression
in a tissue-specific manner using specific transgenic lines. This proposal is conceptually innovative as it is based
on the exploration of a novel technique, CRISPR-RfxCas13d, to knockdown mRNA in a tissue-specific manner
in zebrafish. This approach has never been done in vertebrate model systems where RNAi does not work.
The outcomes of this project will be the first transgenic system to dissect and study gene function by knocking
down mRNA expression in zebrafish. Our approach will help the scientific community investigate gene function
in a faster and tissue-temporal specific manner, as well as answering questions that are very challenging to
address by current methodologies, such as the function of non-coding RNAs or phenotypes caused by multiple
genes. Moreover, by following the guidelines we will optimize through this project, researchers may produce a
whole guideRNA collection, targeting all genes, which should be available for anyone to order to address
their individual research questions. Finally, as we have successfully implemented the CRISPR-Cas13d system
by injection in other organisms such as medaka, killifish, and mouse embryos, our work described in this proposal
may serve as the foundation for transferring this efficient knockdown technology into a range of other species."

The goal of the Boston Children's Hospital K12 CHRCDA Program is to develop independent pediatrician
physician-scientists who will decipher the pathobiology of childhood disease and develop transformative new
therapies. Our Scholars will perform laboratory-based basic and translational research under the mentorship of
outstanding scientists at Boston Children's Hospital and other affiliated institutions. Our program has been
established to ensure the continued development of outstanding independent pediatrician-scientists in the field.
In this proposal, we describe a program that includes intensive mentoring, a comprehensive didactic program,
and appropriate supervision and support to ensure that our Scholars reach their maximum scientific potential.
Programmatic oversight will be provided by an External Advisory Committee and an Internal Steering Committee.
Plans are in place for programmatic self-evaluation and for review of Scholar Progress. We propose to continue
the funding of three Scholar positions. Scholars will be funded for a minimum of two years, contingent on
satisfactory progress on research and career development activities, and the overall pool of Scholar candidates.
Scholars will be faculty members most often at the rank of Instructor, but Assistant Professors who are early in
the development of their independent careers will also be eligible to apply. Scholars will be considered at any
point from the beginning of their Instructorship until they are considered to be two years away from submitting
their first R-level NIH grant or equivalent, though no more than four years beyond the end of fellowship training.
Scholars will work in broad areas of scientific investigation relevant to child health. Past and present Scholars
have studied the genomics of rare childhood disease, developmental biology, mucosal immunology, host-
microbe interactions, monogenic kidney diseases, genetics of epilepsy, and environmental effects on early brain
development. Our Scholars are expected to elucidate molecular mechanisms of disease, leading to the
development of transformative new therapies for a broad range of diseases of childhood."
10792654,"Over 130 million individuals in the US have overweight and obesity, and rural communities experience
significantly higher rates of obesity and related chronic diseases. Fortunately, weight losses of as little as 5-7%
can ameliorate obesity-associated co-morbidities. Although lifestyle interventions successfully produce weight
loss of this magnitude, the reach and availability of weight management programs is limited in rural areas.
Digital interventions offer an attractive alternative for delivering lifestyle programs to rural populations.
However, in-person behavioral obesity treatment programs achieve better weight losses than digital programs,
likely because in-person programs typically include personnel-intensive “high touch” treatment components.
Some studies indicate that having a human “behind the curtain” of a digital program, through emailed feedback
or with the addition of online group sessions, can significantly increase weight loss. Thus, to reduce obesity-
associated health disparities experienced by rural populations, it is time to move the field forward by identifying
the specific constellation of human-delivered digital treatment components that produce the strongest weight
loss outcomes. Therefore, the aims of this study are to increase the public health impact of digital
obesity treatment for rural populations by simultaneously investigating 3 “high touch” intervention
components. We will conduct a highly efficient 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment using the MOST framework with
participants residing in non-urban areas recruited online from across the United States. Participants (N=616;
22% racial/ethnic minority; 40% male) will be randomized to: (1) weekly facilitated synchronous group video
sessions (yes vs. no); (2) type of self-monitoring feedback received (counselor-crafted vs. pre-scripted); and
(3) individual coaching calls (yes vs. no). Based on the results of the experiment, we will identify an optimized
program in which each component (or combination of components) contributes meaningfully (≥1.5 kg at 6-
months) to enhanced weight loss. We will investigate potential mediators (e.g., accountability, social support,
self-regulation, motivation, and problem solving), as well as possible mediators (e.g., sex/gender,
race/ethnicity, age), to explore their impact on weight loss outcomes. We will also examine treatment delivery
costs for each component and conduct exploratory analyses of weight trajectories 6-months post-treatment
(i.e., at 12 months) to elucidate the extended impact of the specific components on weight control. Ultimately,
this research will set the stage for confirming the most promising digital behavioral weight loss intervention for
dissemination without geographic borders to reduce obesity rates among rural residents and provide essential
evidence to inform policy decisions on optimal dissemination."

Intensive insulin treatment decreases the risk of micro- and macrovascular complications in type 1 diabetes
(T1D) but is associated with a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia, limiting optimal glycemic control. Over time,
20-30% of patients with T1D develop impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH), most likely as a
consequence of repeated and severe episodes of hypoglycemia. IAH is, itself, a significant risk factor for
subsequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia, leading to a vicious cycle with potentially lethal consequences.
IAH is associated with diminished counter-regulatory responses (CRR) to hypoglycemia and changes in brain
structure and function. Reducing the frequency of hypoglycemia with advanced technologies (continuous
glucose monitoring [CGM] and insulin pumps) and targeted education improves IAH, but not completely.
The Advanced Insulin Delivery to Reduce Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycemia in a Type 1 Diabetes Cohort
(AIDRIAHT1C) trial aims at testing the efficacy of HCL compared to sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy to
improve awareness of hypoglycemia and CRR by reducing the amount of time spent in hypoglycemia. The
study will enroll a diverse population of adults with T1D of at least ten years duration. Participants will be
classified as having IAH using the HYPO score. Individuals with IAH will be randomized 1:1 to the two
interventions and both groups will receive a targeted educational program designed to decrease hypoglycemia.
At baseline and at 6-month intervals for 2 years, participants will undergo step-wise hyperinsulinemic-
hypoglycemic clamps. The primary outcome, assessed at 12 months, consists of the co-primary endpoints of
CRR to hypoglycemia (endogenous glucose production, pancreatic polypeptide, and epinephrine, tested
hierarchically) and symptom recognition (autonomic symptom score, HYPO score, also tested hierarchically)
(Aim 1). Factors associated with IAH and the restoration of hypoglycemia awareness will be determined from
the screened population and the participants in the trial (Aim 2). A matched control group of healthy non-
diabetic controls and of participants with T1D and normal awareness of hypoglycemia will be enrolled to
provide normative responses to hypoglycemia at baseline. The study also aims at developing new approaches
to diagnosing IAH by testing combinations of self-reported items, CGM-prompted reporting, and physiological
monitoring, and predicting responses to intervention using machine learning and artificial intelligence (Aim 3)
and at studying brain structure and function associated with and predictive of IAH improvement (Aim 4) using
fMRI, with and without hypoglycemia.
The ultimate goals of the study are to identify the best treatment for IAH, develop better ways to identify
individuals at risk, understand the mechanisms of IAH and, ultimately, to reduce the burden and risks associated
with severe hypoglycemia and improve quality of life and treatment satisfaction in patients with T1D."

Significance: The child protection system (CPS) serves as a primary responder to prenatal substance
exposure (PSE), although policies guiding CPS involvement following a substance affected birth vary across
and within jurisdictional settings. While CPS plays an important role in protecting children from harm,
nonuniversal reporting policies offer the potential to deploy CPS intervention more strategically. It is not well
understood how PSE reporting policies are implemented by mandated reporters and how timing of CPS
involvement for substance-exposed infants affects custodial outcomes. Moreover, mandated reporters can
offer key insights into best practice policies and standardized tools that may improve the effectiveness of
reporting policies at discerning when CPS intervention is needed to mitigate risk of child maltreatment.
Specific Aims: The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the implementation and outcomes of CPS
reporting policies and to enumerate promising practices for improving policy performance with three specific
aims: (1) describe women diagnosed with substance use at delivery and those reported to CPS using
descriptive statistics and multilevel modeling through an intersectional equity lens; (2) analyze 3-year custodial
outcomes, comparing births with documented PSE that were and were not reported to CPS in the early
neonatal period; and (3) through content analysis and semi-structured interviews, evaluate policy consistency
and identify best practices that may attenuate family risk and reliance on CPS for certain families.
Approach: For the first two aims, a nonpublic birth cohort dataset of linked administrative records from
California will be used to conduct multilevel and multinomial logistic regressions. For the third aim, a content
analysis of CPS reporting policies at 14 high-risk birth hospitals in Los Angeles County will be augmented by
semi-structured interviews with labor and delivery providers at those institutions. The proposed project is
innovative in its use of linked administrative data with a sufficient sample size for interrogative analyses of
differential outcomes by demographic characteristics at individual and institutional levels. The project is also
innovative in its inclusion of policy content analysis, which fills a key gap in the current policy outcomes
literature. The project is significant in its contribution of individual-level longitudinal and in-depth qualitative
information to a focus area with immediate policy and programmatic relevance.
Fellowship Applicant: The training plan outlined in this proposal will equip the applicant, Julia Reddy, with
advanced epidemiologic skills and critical policy and systems knowledge. This plan will prepare the applicant to
successfully complete the proposed project and advance as an independent public health researcher, focusing
on policies and programs to alleviate the burden of substance use on families. The applicant is well supported
by a strong team of mentors and research advisors who have the requisite experience and training to guide her
doctoral research and aid in her professional development, along with significant institutional support."

Asthma is a complex, inflammatory airway disease that affects millions of people worldwide with striking health
disparities. The relatively high heritability of asthma suggests that genetic factors contribute substantially to
asthma risk. Our understanding of these genetic risk factors has rapidly expanded in just the past few years, with
large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) collectively identifying hundreds of common genetic
variants associated with asthma. The wealth of information coming from these studies suggests that genetics
may improve asthma risk prediction models, which may be useful in intervention, prevention, and targeted
disease management strategies. However, existing models currently have modest clinical potential and primarily
draw from only a handful of personal, family, and environmental variables. Therefore, we propose to apply
statistical approaches to assess the utility of (a) quantitative indexes of genome-wide genetic risk and (b)
aggregated environmental risk exposures, individually and combined, for predicting asthma case status in
populations of different ancestries. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will derive polygenic risk scores (PRS) for asthma
from the largest and most diverse GWAS of asthma to date. In Aim 2, we will develop asthma PRS that leverage
genetic information from correlated diseases and traits. In Aim 3, we will utilize phenome-wide approaches to
select and collate environmental exposures relevant to asthma risk from a rich phenotypic resource, with the
ultimate goal of building an integrated risk model that considers genetic and environmental risk factors across
diverse populations. These Aims will provide insights into the predictive potential of these comprehensive
models, as well as tools for constructing PRS and environmental risk scores for asthma in populations
underrepresented in genomic studies. Together, the analyses will facilitate the development of more accurate
population-based risk prediction tools for asthma. The proposed research will provide the fellowship PI with a
rich training experience in the Harvard PhD Program, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and the
Massachusetts General Hospital. With the mentorship of her sponsors and collaborators, she will achieve several
training goals that will lay the foundation for her development as an independent researcher and ultimately, a
principal investigator."

The multitude and complexity of cortical functions is shaped by the diversity of cortical interneurons populations.
Specifically, somatostatin interneuron, which comprise one-third of all cortical interneurons, route the flow of
information within the cortex by targeting and selectively inhibiting the dendrites of excitatory pyramidal neurons.
Recent efforts have demonstrated that cortical somatostatin interneurons are themselves further divided into
various subtypes. Many studies have characterized the distinct and heterogenous properties of somatostatin
interneuron subtypes in the functioning adult brain and their diverse contributions to cortical function, but the
mechanisms by which this diversity is generated during development are relatively unknown. Recent studies
have devoted considerable effort into obtaining a descriptive account of interneuron diversification during
development by profiling the transcriptomic and epigenetic events that unfold during cortical interneuron
development, but these studies also fall short of presenting a mechanistic explanation.
Our lab and others have previously demonstrated the requirement of the transcription factor Satb1 for the proper
development of cortical somatostatin interneurons. Interestingly, removal of Satb1 has heterogeneous effects
within the somatostatin interneuron population, suggesting that it may contribute to the generation of diverse
features within the somatostatin interneuron population. Moreover, single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data
shows that Satb1 is expressed at varying levels across distinct somatostatin interneuron subtypes. Thus, In this
proposal, I present the hypothesis that Satb1, in a concentration-dependent manner, contributes to somatostatin
interneuron diversity during development by controlling distinct genetic programs. I will test this hypothesis using
a combination of intersectional mouse genetics, epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling, and microscopy. In Aim
1 I seek to characterize varying Satb1 protein levels across somatostatin interneuron subtypes and the
phenotype of Satb1 removal. In Aim 2 I seek to understand the mechanism by which varying Satb1 levels may
lead to distinct genetic programs. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate fundamental
mechanisms by which the brain creates neuronal diversity during development. Furthermore, these studies will
highlight new exciting principles for gene regulation. These data along with the research and scientific expertise
developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an
independent investigator."
10808166,"Growing evidences suggests that exposure to volatile, very volatile, and semi-volatile organic compounds
(collectively abbreviated VOCs) during vulnerable life windows of susceptibility is an important determinant of
maternal-fetal health, with implications for preterm birth, children sensitivity to infections, asthma and other
adverse health outcomes. The central theme of this application focuses on deciphering the signaling pathways
by which exposure to VOCs during pregnancy have an impact on early life growth and development with a
focus on the fetal immune system. Our central hypothesis is that inflammation in the placenta and decidua
due to maternal exposure to VOCs, alters the programming of the fetal immune system, which results
in an aberrant post-natal immune response to respiratory viral infections. Our preliminary studies
suggest that although the fetus may be protected against microbial infection, the outcome of maternal
exposure, protective or deleterious, depends on the nature of the immune response and the severity of the
inflammatory process at the implantation site (placenta-decidua interface). The mechanisms underlying the
response of the fetal immune system and how indirect training by the maternal inflammation takes place is
unclear and understudied. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1. To determine the effect of VOCs maternal exposure on placental and fetal inflammation.
Aim 2. To determine the impact of VOCs exposure on TLR signaling responsible for the homing and
differentiation of T and B cells.
Aim 3. Characterize the signals from the placenta responsible for the susceptibility to respiratory viral
infections of the offspring.
 Upon completion of these aims we will have a better understanding of the outcomes associated with
the impact of VOCs exposure on the placental/decidua unit and its consequent influence on fetal programing
and its potential effects on the development of an appropriate neonatal immune responses. Adequate
response to infection is the result of a delicate balance between an efficient immune response against
pathogens and its quick resolution preventing widespread over-activation. The cellular and molecular
components of this regulatory balance are determined during fetal development."

Renal cell cancer (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, and despite therapeutic advances, mortality
remains high. While there are over a dozen RCC subtypes with different genomic drivers, metabolic
reprogramming is a shared feature of tumorigenesis and progression across most of the major forms of kidney
cancer and represents a targetable vulnerability in RCC. Our preliminary results show that RCCs and other
cancers rely on the amino acid asparagine for tumor mTORC1 activity and growth, and methods to deplete tumor
asparagine levels impair cancer cell proliferation and block cancer growth. Cancers acquire asparagine through
two main routes: 1) consumption from the environment, and 2) biosynthesis from aspartate via asparagine
synthetase (ASNS). Over the last 5 years, we found that simultaneous reduction of tumor asparagine
consumption and biosynthesis blocks growth of lung, breast, and pancreas cancers in mice. Tumor asparagine
consumption can be targeted using L-Asparaginase (ASNase), which hydrolyzes serum asparagine, or dietary
asparagine restriction, which reduces serum asparagine levels. Tumor asparagine biosynthesis can be targeted
using metformin, which through inhibiting complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC), reduces cancer cell
production of aspartate, an obligate substrate for ASNS biosynthesis of asparagine. In this renewal proposal,
we will investigate kidney cancer asparagine dependency to determine whether asparagine depletion can be
broadly applied to treat patients with various subtypes of RCC. We will also determine the mechanism by which
asparagine is sensed in cancer cells to impact mTORC1 activity and whether asparagine depletion impacts
immune cell activation within the RCC tumor microenvironment."

Successful treatment and management of oral mucosal lesions depend on a definitive, accurate, and timely
diagnosis. Despite easy accessibility to the oral cavity, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common
oral cancer, is often not diagnosed until late stages, leading to a poor prognosis. Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED)
is a microscopically diagnosed precancerous lesion associated with an increased risk of OSCC transformation.
An OED can be histologically graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on the World Health Organization’s
three-tier classification system. Unfortunately, the gold standard histopathological diagnosis relies on subjective
morphological evaluation of the biopsy tissue and is unable to identify high-risk OEDs that are most likely to
undergo malignant transformation. The lack of an objective and quantitative OED risk stratification approach has
prevented effective management of precancerous oral lesions and delayed the diagnosis of OSCC. We propose
a novel approach using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic (FTIR) imaging and machine learning to
address the medical gap of objective OED risk assessment. FTIR spectroscopy provides quantitative
biochemical information of a sample in the form of characteristic absorption spectrum. With a microscope
coupled to an FTIR spectrometer, FTIR imaging allows detailed and spatially resolved biochemical analysis of a
sample, with each pixel containing a full FTIR spectrum. Machine learning is a powerful tool for hyperspectral
FTIR image analysis and diagnostic model development. Using FTIR imaging aided by machine learning, we
successfully trained three machine learning classifiers with 95–100% accuracy in discriminating OSCC from
benign oral tissues in our preliminary study. More excitingly, our results demonstrated an innovative stratification
of severe OEDs into Benign-like and OSCC-like subgroups based on their epithelial FTIR fingerprints. Inspired
by the early finding, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that FTIR imaging aided by machine learning
provides objective and quantitative OED risk stratification. To test the hypothesis, we propose the following two
specific aims: 1) to develop OSCC-Benign classifiers based on epithelial and stromal FTIR fingerprints, and 2)
to evaluate the feasibility of the FTIR image-based approach in OED risk stratification. The long-term goal of the
research is to develop an artificial intelligence aided precision imaging system using FTIR imaging or in
combination with other morphological and functional imaging modalities such as digital pathology and
immunohistochemistry for early oral cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."

Exposure to drugs of abuse, such as alcohol, induces plasticity in the brain and creates persistent drug-related
memories. These brain changes and persistent activation of drug memories are believed to be central in
contributing to drug addiction. A preponderance of literature has studied the tripartite synapse (pre- and
postsynaptic cells, and astrocytes) in addiction; however, mounting evidence has implicated the tetrapartite
synapse to indicate the additional involvement of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in this process. The ECM
is comprised of a complex network of glycoproteins, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG), and enzymes,
which interact to control underlying cell plasticity and excitability. Glycoproteins and CSPGs aggregate around
inhibitory fast-spiking parvalbumin (PVB) interneurons throughout the brain to form perineuronal nets (PNN)
which maintain and strengthen synapses. In rodents, PNNs are temporarily degraded after acute exposure to
drugs, a process that relies on the activity of glial cells which secrete endogenous proteases that cleave PNN
components. After persistent activation of reward memories (i.e., dependence), PNNs numbers are increased,
indicating that neuronal ensembles associated with drugs of abuse are enveloped by PNNs. While the findings
studying PNNs in preclinical addiction models are compelling, there are currently no data regarding PNNs in
humans with alcohol use disorder (AUD) or other substance use disorders. This proposal focuses on alcohol-
induced changes in PNNs and the molecules that regulate PNNs in humans, and how modifying neuron-
microglia signaling cascades in rodents alters the regulation of contextual alcohol reward memory and the
composition of PNNs. In Aim 1, we will evaluate PNN densities in human postmortem hippocampus tissue using
quantitative brightfield microscopy together with measures of protein and mRNA expression for several of the
endogenous ECM proteases, GABAergic neurons (e.g., PVB), and synaptic markers in tissue samples from the
same subject cohort. We predict that individuals with AUD will have increased numerical densities of PNNs and
increased PVB expression that coincide with decreased expression of ECM proteases. These findings will
delineate how PNNs are impacted in humans with AUD and provide a basis for evaluating whether PNN changes
in rodent models of substance use disorders are translatable to humans. In Aim 2, we will use mice to evaluate
how knockout of the interleukin-33 receptor, ST2, impacts reward memory using conditioned place preference.
Interleukin-33 is secreted by neurons in an experience-dependent manner, where it signals to its obligate ST2
receptor on microglia to mediate the release of several endogenous ECM proteases. We predict that knockout
of the interleukin-33 receptor will impede the proteolytic cascades that mediate memory formation and
consolidation, thereby curbing alcohol-induced place preference acquisition and consolidation. We believe the
proposed studies will inform the use of pharmacologic agents which target the ECM to treat AUD and other
substance use disorders, and will confirm and expand on findings from preclinical studies of the ECM in addiction."

Accumulating evidence indicates that the ability to mount an effective Nrf2-mediated gene
expression response to oxidative stress declines during the aging process. In particular, nuclear
but not cytoplasmic Nrf2 is depleted in neurons of AD patients. In animal models, loss of Nrf2
signaling exacerbates amyloid and tau deposition, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits,
whereas induction of Nrf2 signaling protects against these phenotypes. While toxic tau
assemblies, oxidative stress, cytoskeletal disruption, and autophagy defects are cardinal features
of tauopathies, including AD, how these cellular brain phenotypes integrate at the molecular level
to produce physiological or pathological responses during tau pathogenesis is unknown. In
addition to the known regulation of the cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and autophagy by SSH1, our
new preliminary studies show that the SSH1 pathway intersects with the Nrf2 to inhibit and titrate
Nrf2 signaling. Our overarching hypothesis is that the nexus between the SSH1 and Nrf2
pathways represents a tipping point that tips the balance between degeneration and protection
during proteotoxic and oxidative stress in tauopathies. As both Nrf2 and SSH1 are activated under
oxidative stress, understanding how the nexus between Nrf2 and SSH1 is physiologically and
pathologically regulated will provide key insights into treating AD and other tauopathies.
Utilizing in vitro recombinant proteins, cellular models, animal models, and postmortem brains
combined with mechanistic biochemical, immunochemical, in situ proximity ligation assays, RNA-
seq, and proteomics studies, we will define and dissect how the SSH1-Nrf2 nexus tips the balance
between neurodegeneration vs. neuroprotection in tauopathies."

neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), where disruption of myelin can result in improper
neuronal function and may ultimately lead to axonal degeneration along with other symptoms. While the
importance of myelin is thus evident, there are currently no treatment options to prevent or aid in remyelination,
in part because the molecular mechanisms of myelin formation are not fully understood. However, the
endocannabinoid system (ECS) has gained increasing interest as a potential target to treat several
neurological diseases, including MS. Yet there is no clear understanding in the relationship between the ECS
and OL development or myelination. Aiming to understand of the molecular mechanisms that drive OL
development and myelination, our lab conducted a proteomic analysis of cultured rat primary OLs in which
myelination was increased by genetic methods. Among the list of proteins that were significantly upregulated in
OLs with increased myelin were two ECS enzymes, FAAH1 and DAGL-. This increase occurred during OL
precursor (OPC) differentiation, suggesting the ECS may play a role at this stage of OL development. This
model is supported by my preliminary in vivo studies in zebrafish activating the ECS. For this proposal, I aim to
define the role of CB1 and CB2 in OL development and myelination through continued pharmacological
receptor manipulation, careful genomic analysis using CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing, and precise
multidimensional receptor activation and live imaging. In Aim 1, I will use a range of pharmacological and
genetic approaches to dissect the roles of CB1 and CB2 in various stages of OL development and myelination.
In Aim 2, I will investigate the downstream signaling effects of CB1 activation through calcium imaging, using a
novel photocaged ligand that is genetically targeted to OL lineage cells."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in the United States. Chronic
alcohol consumption in individuals with AUD is associated with lowered glucose metabolism and increased
acetate metabolism in the brain. Following abrupt cessation of alcohol consumption, sudden decreases in
acetate may cause the brain to become “energy-deprived”, which could induce heightened craving and
symptoms of withdrawal. The main goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that energy deprivation during
withdrawal contributes to alcohol craving by influencing reward-encoding neural circuitry. Analyses for Specific
Aim 1 will focus on defining the impact of altered brain metabolism in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
(dACC) on its connectivity with the ventral striatum (VS) and on specifying the role of connectivity between the
dACC and VS in facilitating whole-brain transitions to alcohol cue-induced neural activity states. Analyses for
Specific Aim 2 will seek to define the relationship between metabolic function in the dACC, its role in driving
whole-brain dynamics, and alcohol craving. Completion of this proposal will provide a framework for predicting
the impact of metabolic interventions on brain state and craving, which will aid the development of therapeutic
approaches for AUD."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy, caused by more than 3100 mutations
in 80 genes that are primarily specific to rod photoreceptors. Following the major rod death phase, cone death
occurs regardless of the underlying gene mutations. However, there exists a knowledge gap in understanding
how aerobic glycolysis in cones impacts the delicate “metabolic coupling” between cones and retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) in RP. In this proposal, we hypothesize that reprogramming rod and cone aerobic glycolysis
can promote cone survival in RP independent of the underlying rod-specific gene mutations. To test this
hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine whether enhanced aerobic
glycolysis in cone photoreceptors can promote their survival in a novel genetic mouse model. In Aim 2, we will
test the potential of gene therapy to slow photoreceptor degeneration by enhancing aerobic glycolysis in mouse
models of RP and characterizing the metabolic changes that occur. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will evaluate the safety
profile of the gene therapy described in Aim 2."
10834023,"Project Summary
A major target of retinal output is the superior colliculus (SC). In fact, more retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types may
project to the SC than any other retinal target including the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Understanding
retinal input to SC is important because SC plays a major role in a range of attentional and decision-making
processes in both rodents and primates – two major model systems used in biomedical research supported by
the National Institutes of Health. However, the functional diversity of retinal input to SC, and ultimately how it
impacts SC signaling, remains poorly understood in mammals. This gap is particularly pronounced in primates.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the diversity of cell types and the visual signals they transmit
from the retina to SC in rats and rhesus monkeys. The rationale for this proposal is that to understand the role
of SC in visually guided behaviors, we must determine how retinal signals converge and are processed in SC.
The first step toward achieving this goal is to determine which RGC types project to SC and what visual signals
they carry. Performing these experiments in both rodents and macaques is critical not just for understanding
which specific visual pathways are conserved (or diverge) from rodent to the primate brain, but also what
evolutionary advantages such specializations endow to each species. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will use and
optimize viral methods for retrogradely infecting RGCs that project directly to SC in rats. We will determine the
morphological diversity of these RGCs. We will also determine their receptive fields and other visual response
properties, ex vivo, using large-scale multi-electrode arrays. The outcome will be a complete catalog of the
morphological and functional types of RGCs that project to SC in the rat brain. In Aim 2, we will use the most
effective viral approaches from Aim 1 to dissect the diversity of RGC types that project to SC in monkeys. As
with rats, we will determine the morphological diversity of these RGCs in macaques and determine their receptive
fields and other visual response properties using large-scale, high throughput electrophysiology. In Aim 3, we
will determine the overlap of RGC projections to SC and LGN, separately for rats and primates. Retrograde
viruses injected into SC and LGN will carry genes for different fluorescent proteins that will allow us to determine
the types and functions of RGCs that project to one versus both brain areas. The overall outcome of this project
will be a functional and morphological catalog of RGCs that project to SC in rats and primates, allowing for
detailed cross-species comparison of this key visual circuit. This comparison is important given how much
research is dedicated to the rodent visual system with the ultimate aim of understanding the human visual
system. The data will be critical for designing next-stage studies that will measure and manipulate the functions
of specific populations of SC-projecting RGCs in order to determine their contributions to visual processing and
behavior and their potential impairments in ADHD and other attentional and visuomotor disorders."

How do neurons coordinate alternative energy sources to meet
 the demands of neural computation?
PI:Clandinin
 The brain is energetically expensive, a metabolic cost that is intrinsic to neural activity and hence a
defining feature of how the brain computes. As a result of this energy intensive operation, the main methods
for measuring changes in neural activity in humans, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
actually infer neural activity by measuring changes in blood flow, a proxy for local energy consumption.
Moreover, many diseases that alter the efficiency and balance of energy production are characterized by
profound deficits in brain function. However, how neural activity shapes energy production at the level of
individual cells, circuits and across the brain are only incompletely understood, particularly in the context of
active sensation and behavior.
 Longstanding work in the field, based in vitro models of single cells and human neuroimaging, have
revealed how different pathways for energy production react to changes in neural activity, responding when
increases in neural activity cause depletion of ATP, a core cellular energy currency. Our recent work using the
intact brain of the behaving fruit fly build on these results, and revealed a new element to the coupling between
metabolism and energy production, namely that cells use current levels of neural activity to predict future
energy needs. Thus, this project seeks to answer how the reactive and predictive elements of neural-metabolic
energy coupling interact.
 The proposed work focuses on three key questions. First, do different neuron types, with distinct
patterns of activity in the intact brain, display differences in how they react to, and predict, metabolic load?
Second, how do neurons balance energy production via two alternative energy sources, namely glycolysis and
oxidative phosphorylation, to both react to metabolic cost and predict future expenditures? Finally, how are
these metabolic loads coordinated across circuits in behaving animals detecting sensory stimuli? We
hypothesize that because neuronal activity levels differ substantially across cell types, and because glycolysis
and oxidative phosphorylation can produce ATP with different latencies and efficiencies, subcellular
compartments, neurons and circuits dynamically switch between alternative energy sources to both react to
computational demand and predict future metabolic need. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use two
photon imaging of fluorescent sensors of neural activity and metabolic flux, combined with genetic and
optogenetic perturbations of specific cell types, using the adult fruit fly brain as a model.
 As many of the genes involved in energy metabolism are evolutionarily conserved between humans
and flies, deepening our understanding of how neural activity couples to energy metabolism in vivo will
increasing our understanding of the neural impacts of metabolic diseases, possibly opening new therapeutic
avenues for future investigation."

Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) have great potential for therapeutic use in direct brain-computer interface (BCI)
control of robotic prostheses to improve the lives of patients suffering from debilitating conditions related to loss
of limbs or limb function. MEAs also have the potential to restore loss of sensory perception in vision, hearing,
and tactile sensation by applying patterned current stimulation to sensory neurons. As promising as these
therapies are, there is a major shortcoming to the current state of the art in implanted MEAs in that their recording
and stimulation quality degrades over time, and the implants eventually become non-functional. Their use as
therapeutic devices to treat chronic conditions that persist for the patient's life requires MEAs that are stable over
decades rather than months to years. The underlying mechanisms leading to failure for chronically implanted
MEAs have yet to be fully elucidated. One candidate is degradation of the electrode or insulation material leading
to mechanical device failure. Another important factor is the host foreign body response. Inflammation due to
activation of microglia and astrocytes can lead to gliosis and the formation of a “glial scar” encapsulating the
device and preventing efficient recording and stimulation of neurons. Recently, gene therapy-based interventions
using CRISPR/Cas systems for gene knockout have shown great promise in modifying the immune response.
Recent work in the Cui lab has shown the efficacy of using functionalized silica nanoparticles (SNPs) as a
versatile surface modification for microelectrodes. MEAs coated with polyethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT)/SNP
have improved electrochemical properties over standard bare metal electrodes and the capacity to be loaded
with therapeutic compounds due to their porous structure with a high surface area. These properties make MEAs
coated with PEDOT/SNP an ideal platform for highly targeted gene delivery, as the silica nanoparticles can be
efficiently loaded with DNA. This proposal aims to develop this technology to efficiently gene modify microglia
locally around implanted MEAs to reduce inflammation and to measure the effect of inflammation on recording
quality and stimulation efficiency, as well as long-term device stability. In addition, I will investigate how changes
in the foreign body response affect the remodeling of tissue surrounding the implant. I will take the approach of
loading SNP coated MEAs with DNA encoding CRISPR gene therapy vectors targeting inflammatory pathways
in microglia. The CRISPR vectors will be electrochemically delivered to cells directly interfacing with the
implanted devices. The development of this technology has great potential to enhance the therapeutic value of
implanted devices by increasing their performance and longevity by reducing inflammation and gliosis and to
increase our fundamental understanding of how the brain responds to implanted devices. Once established, this
technology will be a versatile platform for highly targeted gene delivery, having both spatiotemporal and cell-type
specificity."
10827859,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aiming spatial neglect (SN) is a sub-type of SN that is a dysfunction in initiation/execution of motor–intentional
behavior. SN components such as directional hypokinesia, turning behavior, weight-bearing asymmetry, and
veering with straight-walking path adversely affect walking. However, there is a paucity of treatments targeting
gait dysfunction caused by SN. Dr. Barrett (sponsor) is a leading rehabilitation researcher who has characterized
Aiming SN and has established prism adaptation therapy (PAT) as an effective treatment to reduce pathological
Aiming SN and improve upper extremity function post-stroke. However, while traditional PAT remains effective
for targeting the upper extremity, its generalization to walking has only been studied in able-bodied people. In
parallel, other studies have shown that electrical stimulation applied to the affected side improves SN deficits in
stroke survivors, but the additive effects of electrical stimulation and PAT are largely unknown. Dr. Kesar (co-
sponsor) has expertise in post-stroke gait biomechanics and gait rehabilitation treatments incorporating electrical
stimulation. Dr. Kesar has shown that adding electrical stimulation during gait training enhances motor learning,
augments force production, restores gait deficits, and improves walking function. Importantly, the feasibility and
effects of adding electrical stimulation to augment the effects of PAT and gait training in stroke survivors with SN
are not well-studied. Thus, this F31 research proposal seeks to generate data supporting novel motor spatial
retraining approaches that can enhance the rehabilitation of SN and gait performance in individuals post-stroke.
I will evaluate novel combinations of PAT, electrical stimulation, and gait training, which are effective
rehabilitation paradigms previously studied in isolation, as well as their effects on Aiming SN and gait post-stroke.
Specifically, this F31 proposal will evaluate the effects of combining PAT and electrical stimulation (Aim 1), as
well as PAT and gait training (Aim 2), on Aiming SN and gait performance in post-stroke Aiming SN. I hypothesize
that adding stimulation to the neglected upper limb during PAT will induce larger improvements in Aiming SN
versus PAT without electrical stimulation and that PAT with electrical stimulation will induce greater
generalization to gait performance. In addition, I hypothesize that
gait training
with stimulation to the left lower
limb
preceded by PAT will induce larger improvements in gait performance than gait training with stimulation
alone. This F31 proposal will capitalize on the PI’s clinical training and mentoring team’s expertise in post-stroke
Aiming SN (sponsor Barrett) and gait (co-sponsor Kesar) rehabilitation to address SN and gait deficits in
individuals with SN post-stroke. This work will generate novel information that will inform future design of new
and targeted treatment protocols for evidence-based rehabilitation of spatial neglect and gait dysfunctions post-
stroke, to improve gait function and quality of life in stroke survivors."
10887824,"Project Summary. The mission of this SEPA grant at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) is to
foster thoughtful American Indian scholars of science by engaging motivated American Indian youth and
their families in a culturally validated, comprehensive and layered science education, mentoring, and research
program that will build the skills and confidence necessary for students to matriculate into and succeed in the
biomedical and behavioral sciences. American Indian communities have a rich history of science spanning
thousands of years that has been overlooked and undervalued by Western science, leading to disparities in
educational attainment. Despite their long-standing contributions to science, American Indian populations have
the lowest high school graduation rates and only 47% of American Indian students are enrolled in K-12 public
schools with a full range of STEM curriculum. Thus, the proposed grant seeks to develop and deliver
educational and research activities for American Indian middle school and high school students in the
biomedical and behavioral sciences to increase their interest in pursuing studies and careers in STEM
by addressing the following aims:
1) Engage 6-12th grade students in STEM based workshops and activities to increase interest in STEM fields
 and careers;
2) Develop and run a mentored summer program at California State University San Marcos to engage
 American Indian students and their families in STEM activities and college readiness;
3) Create a near-peer mentoring program between students in current NIH supported training programs and
 6-12th grade American Indian students and their families;
4) Provide research opportunities for American Indian students to gain experience in STEM, including in the
 area of substance use and opioid overdose within Native Nations.
Youth will be provided mentoring from both program faculty and from near-peer mentors, will engage in
interactive science activities, and will have the opportunity to both shadow in research labs and develop their
own research projects to address substance use and opioid overdose in their communities. Additionally, the
curriculum will be infused with cultural validation to contribute a greater sense of belonging and thereby
increase persistence in biomedical and behavioral careers."
10887825,"Structural racism (SR) denotes the multidimensional and systemic oppression of Black individuals in the US.
Residential segregation is a central component of SR. According to experts, race-based residential
segregation is a fundamental determinant of racial disparities in health through neighborhood disadvantage
leading to high rates of chronic disease and lower life expectancy in these communities. According to the
concept of “weathering”, cumulative exposure to racial injustices (including segregation) over the life course
wear at the physical and mental health of minoritized communities. Spatial manifestations of SR have been
linked to stress responses, immune dysregulation, and heightened chronic inflammation among US Black
individuals. Transfer of a propensity toward chronic inflammation from mother to infant can create an
intergenerational cycle of disadvantage and poor health, leading to the health inequities observed today. We
posit that maternal exposure to SR is linked to observed evidence of initial stages of disease processes in their
offspring. We propose to examine the association between maternal lifetime exposure to SR and the presence
of inflammatory markers in the child’s neonatal dried blood spots (DBS) using a cohort of women who have
delivered a child at Henry Ford Health (HFH), a Detroit-based health care organization serving a diverse
population with respect to race and socioeconomic status. DBS are routinely collected at birth and stored by
the State of Michigan. Our plan to define the proposed exposure, SR, builds on existing literature and the
expertise of our team. We will characterize neighborhoods in the Detroit metropolitan area and assign a
“Neighborhood SR Score” using existing spatial measures of SR (e.g., racial inequities in the domains of
housing, education, employment, etc.). Aim 1 is to create a cumulative Lifetime SR Exposure Score for each
participant based on their lifetime residential history. Aim 2 is to associate the Lifetime SR Exposure Score to
the levels of inflammatory markers measured in the DBS of participant offspring using an untargeted
metabolomics platform. We have the investigator expertise needed to achieve our aims, including
epidemiology, biostatistics, untargeted metabolomics, and urban planning, and we have access to the targeted
population. This R21 will assess the feasibility of creating exposure and outcome measures as well recruitment
and data collection. Our work includes the domains of influence reflective of SR from the National Minority
Health and Health Disparities Research Framework and will inform a larger study. Empirical evidence of how
SR can initiate processes in early life that manifest in adult disease is an invaluable step in eliminating health
inequities."

Protective factors across the life course can have profound effects on individual health. It has been well
established that adverse childhood experiences and lifetime exposure to discrimination and victimization have
negative mental and physical health effects. For women who are Black and transgender, adversity can be
compounded by the intersectional impact of racism and gender-based discrimination. A constellation of
interpersonal protective factors throughout the lifespan, including positive childhood experiences, family
acceptance, and social support, may help to improve mental health outcomes among individuals as they
experience adversity throughout the life course. Additionally, mental health symptom self-management may
moderate the relationship between Black transgender women's experiences with protective factors and current
psychological distress symptoms. Self-management, defined as drawing upon one's own ability to promote
health or manage disease, may be instrumental in improving mental health outcomes and could be vital for this
population due to significant known barriers to healthcare engagement. However, there is limited exploration of
protective factors and self-management on mental health outcomes among Black transgender women. To
address this gap, a convergent mixed-methods study is proposed to increase our understanding of how protective
factors are associated with mental health self-management and psychological distress among Black transgender
women. This training grant, nested within a larger parent study, takes a strengths-based approach to examine
complex relationships between the variables of interest. The specific aims are: Aim 1. Determine the associations
among interpersonal protective factors (i.e., positive childhood experiences, perceived family acceptance, and
current social support) and current symptoms of psychological distress for Black transgender women (N=150).
Aim 2. Determine the role of mental health self-management in moderating the associations between
interpersonal protective factors, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of PTSD. Aim 3. Use thematic content
analysis of in-depth interviews with 30 Black transgender women from Aim 1 to analyze how interpersonal
protective factors influenced Black transgender women's abilities to self-manage psychological distress
symptoms. Findings will inform future recommendations for interventions aimed at decreasing the harmful
effects of adversity and discrimination for racially diverse transgender youth and adults."

 There is a fundamental gap in the understanding of how electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) al-
ter the adolescent brain. Adolescents are a high-risk population in regards to nicotine-containing products as
prenatal or early exposure triggers significant changes in the prefrontal cortex. With the growing popularity of
ENDS among American adolescents, there is a critical need to understand how ENDS devices alter neurobiol-
ogy to trigger addiction to nicotine. This is especially true given that ENDS are unique from combustible ciga-
rettes given the multitude of flavors and different nicotine formulations that are specific to only ENDS e-liquids.
Additionally, pod-based ENDS (i.e., Juul) contain a significantly higher concentration of nicotine compared to
combustible cigarettes and tank-based ENDS. Until this knowledge gap is closed, we face the risk of increased
smoking initiation, decreased cessation, and a cumulative effect of a growing population of lifelong smokers in
America. Our overall goal is to identify the key changes in neurobiology, specific to ENDS, in an adolescent
mouse model system that regulates nicotine reward and reinforcement. To address this, we will utilize a novel
contingent nicotine self-administration assay system that allows us to use the same e-liquid tanks and Pods
popular with adolescent ENDS users in a mouse model system. This will provide high translational value as we
can directly assess how ENDS directly alter neurobiology and neurophysiology.
 We hypothesize that directly linking self-administration behavior to nAChR upregulation and changes in
neurophysiology will identify brain regions and cell-types that are critical for the initiation of nicotine addiction
and continued reinforcement. The rationale behind this comes from the applicant’s previous success in corre-
lating nicotine reward to nAChR upregulation. We will identify ENDS-specific changes in neurobiology with
three specific aims. First, we will utilize e-Vape nicotine self-administration assays in mice to examine initiation
and nicotine reinforcement of ENDS to examine the impact of nicotine dose, formulation, and flavors on vap-
ing-related behavior. Second, we will use the brains from the first aim to examine nAChR upregulation and
provide a direct link between self-administration behavior and nAChR upregulation. Third, we will examine
changes in neurophysiology via electrophysiology and fast-scan cyclic voltammetry.
 This approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it establishes a direct correlation be-
tween vaping-related self-administration and nAChR upregulation as well as changes in neurophysiology in an
in vivo model and utilizes the exact same ENDS and e-liquids popular with human adolescent vapers. This is
complemented by the use of a novel mouse expressing α4-mCherry and α6-GFP nAChR subunits that allow
analysis of upregulation without the use of antibodies. The proposed research is significant, because it will
dramatically increase our knowledge of how ENDS contribute to addictive behavior. This would contribute sig-
nificantly to several of the priorities and interests of NIDA."

Approximately 8 million adults in the US suffer from balance impairment due to damage to the peripheral
vestibular system, but effective treatments for balance dysfunction are lacking. Vestibular hair cells within
vestibular canal and otolith organs convert motion into receptor potentials and sensory information is relayed to
the brain by action potentials (APs) in vestibular afferent nerves. Afferents in central zones (CZ) of vestibular
neuroepithelia exhibit different responses to vestibular stimuli than afferents in peripheral zones (PZ). The
nature of the neural code conveying vestibular information in distinct afferent types is poorly understood. There
are 3 types of vestibular afferents: calyx-only afferents innervate one or more type I hair cells, bouton dendrites
innervate type II hair cells and dimorphic afferents contact both hair cell types. Our goal is to elucidate distinct
AP firing mechanisms in afferents with calyx terminals to better understand vestibular coding. Calyx-only
afferents are present solely in CZ and have irregular firing patterns, whereas dimorphic afferents exist in both
CZ and PZ and have regular firing patterns. To achieve our goal we will refine novel preparations of vestibular
cristae and utricles, developed by our laboratory, as tools to study calyx-bearing afferents in CZ and PZ of
gerbil neuroepithelia. Electrophysiological, hair bundle stimulation, immunohistochemical and pharmacological
approaches will allow characterization of ion channels in afferent fibers in developing and mature epithelia. In
Aim 1 we will determine the contributions of K+ channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-
gated channels to AP firing in CZ and PZ afferents. Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that Nav1.6 channels with
transient and resurgent characterisitics contribute uniquely to AP firing in mature PZ dimorphs. In Aim 3 we will
incorporate ion channel data from Aims 1 and 2 into a novel, custom-written three dimensional mathematical
model of the calyx to provide insight into our zonally-driven experimental findings. To determine how channel
localization directly impacts AP firing, identified channel types will be strategically placed on the inner and outer
faces of the calyx terminal and associated axon and channel density varied. Our results will clarify how sensory
information is conveyed and how zonal encoding is generated within segregated vestibular afferents. Our data
will inform development of vestibular neurotherapeutics targeting specific groups of ion channels in afferent
nerves. Existing vestibular prosthetic implants attempt to restore normal vestibular function by direct electrical
stimulation of vestibular afferents. A clearer understanding of AP generation and propagation within vestibular
afferent sub-types is needed to inform appropriate electrical stimulation parameters. Results from this work
could provide important new information on vestibular afferent coding and inform development of
pharmaceutical and electrical strategies to combat vestibular dysfunction."

Gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a promising method to treat this devastating
disorder, and 3 companies have recently initiated human clinical trials of AAV/micro-dystrophin infusion. This
approach has shown significant potential in pre-clinical studies, and early data from the trials are encouraging.
It is hoped that DMD gene therapy will be effective in greatly slowing the development of dystrophy in young
boys. Nonetheless, there remain a number of critical issues related to current vector delivery outcomes,
several of which will be addressed in this renewal application. Our proposed studies are a natural progression
of our previous lines of investigation. For example, in previous grant cycles we performed extensive
structure/function studies of dystrophin that led to miniaturized clones that we chose to name “micro-
dystrophin” (µDys). Our groups also developed compact, yet powerful muscle-specific gene regulatory
cassettes from the MCK gene that enabled µDys expression from within AAV vectors. We also showed for the
first time that AAV could be used for systemic gene delivery to muscles of adult animals. These studies led to
extensive studies on methods and outcomes of systemic delivery to large animal models for DMD and
facilitated the recently initiated human clinical trials. Here we propose to extend these studies by focusing on
several critical unresolved issues related to DMD gene therapy. Initially, the relative importance of dystrophin
expression in myogenic stem cells and mature myofibers will be explored. These studies will include a focus
on muscle maintenance & regeneration. Also, current clinical trials are typically focused on very young DMD
boys, yet it remains unclear whether any aspects of the dystrophic phenotype can be reversed in older boys by
expression of dystrophin, a question we will address in aging and old animal models of DMD. Furthermore,
issues remain surrounding the efficiency and safety of AAV-mediated dystrophin delivery to widely dispersed
muscles, stems cells and the liver at tolerable and affordable vector doses. Consequently, we will explore
vector modifications that could increase gene delivery efficiency, safety and persistence. We continue to
believe that gene therapy offers real hope for treating DMD, which is among the most common human genetic
disorders. Our proposed studies have significant potential to improve both the efficacy and safety of ongoing
therapies, with the hope that a robust and safe treatment can emerge for boys and young men with this
disorder. Finally, we note that enhancements to gene therapy for DMD should be generally applicable to many
forms of muscular dystrophy and other disorders of striated muscle."
10833487,"The rise in antibiotic resistance has severely depleted our arsenal for combatting deadly bacterial
pathogens. Meanwhile, despite increased appreciation of the myriad ways that microbiome bacteria impact
human health, most of the signals that bacteria use to influence hosts remain unknown. This proposal seeks to
address both of these challenges by leveraging our team’s unique expertise and recent discovery that animals
can directly sense and respond to bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs).
 Since the discovery of antibiotics in the 1920s, the pathogenesis field has primarily focused on small
molecules: nearly all known antibiotics and bacterial signaling molecules are small molecules. But we sorely
need new, orthogonal approaches. Nucleic acid-based therapies have emerged as an exciting new platform for
rapid drug development. Due to their chemical similarity, the pharmacology of nucleic acids is established,
such that once we know what sequence to target, the drug development pipeline is relatively streamlined (at
least in comparison to small molecule drugs). For example, a Batten disease patient was recently successfully
treated with a personalized synthetic antisense RNA, less than a year after her genome was sequenced.
 RNA-based interventions have typically not been considered for bacteria because bacterial RNAs were
thought to function exclusively within the bacteria. However, we recently overturned this paradigm by proving
that model animal hosts can directly “read” the sRNAs produced by the human pathogen, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, using the RNA-interference (RNAi) machinery to respond to the bacterial sRNAs. This result is
particularly exciting because it suggests a previously unappreciated role for the RNAi machinery in sensing
and responding to bacteria. It also suggests that understanding sRNA-based microbe-host signaling could help
develop new therapies to help hosts ward off pathogens or promote commensal colonization. However,
advancing such new antimicrobial strategies is currently hindered by our lack of knowledge regarding the
space of sRNA-mediated bacteria-host interactions and the molecular mechanisms by which they function.
 Here, we propose to build off our discovery of sRNA-host signaling to significantly close this knowledge
gap. This will be accomplished in three complementary parts that span multiple hosts and microbes: globally
mapping human gut microbiome community sRNA-host interactions and functions, determining how
mammalian cells respond to pathogen sRNAs, and using C. elegans to characterize the molecular
mechanisms of sRNA-host interactions. To achieve these goals we will combine the expertise of our team,
comprised of leaders in the fields of human microbiome and computational biology (Donia), microbial
pathogenesis and antibiotic development (Gitai), and C. elegans behavior and genomics (Murphy). Our
combined efforts thus have the potential to establish new paradigms for microbe-host interactions and pave the
way to desperately-needed new therapies."
10833088,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed research explores the fascinating regulatory system that governs the eukaryotic cell division
cycle. The cell-cycle control system is based on master regulatory enzymes that include the cyclin-dependent
protein kinases (Cdks) and a ubiquitin ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C).
As the cell progresses through the steps of cell division, sequential Cdk-cyclin complexes modify hundreds of
proteins, leading to chromosome duplication in S phase and alignment of duplicated chromosome on the
mitotic spindle in M phase. The APC/C then triggers destruction of several key regulators, unleashing the
dramatic events of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. One critical APC/C substrate is securin, an
inhibitor of the protease, separase; APC/C-mediated securin destruction releases separase to cleave the
cohesin complex holding duplicated chromosomes together. The precise timing of cell cycle events requires
that Cdks and the APC/C are activated and modify their targets in a specific order. The biochemical
mechanisms underlying this order are the central focus of the research described in this application. The work
will explore a diverse array of interesting mechanistic problems in Cdk and APC/C function. Studies in budding
yeast will address the complex information processing that can be achieved through multi-site phosphorylation
of Cdk substrates, focusing on transcriptional regulators that govern cyclin gene expression. Multiple lines of
investigation will address the mechanisms by which the APC/C, together with its substrate-binding activator
subunit, controls the destruction of specific targets. A newly developed single-molecule approach will provide
rigorous quantitative measurements of APC/C-substrate interactions, providing insight into the variations in
substrate affinity that underlie the ordering of cell cycle events. Biochemical and structural approaches with
human proteins will be used to unravel the mechanisms by which the APC/C activator subunit is loaded onto
the APC/C by the chaperonin TRiC/CCT. Similar approaches will be used to determine the mechanisms by
which human separase recognizes its substrates, and the mechanisms by which securin and other regulatory
proteins inhibit separase catalytic function. The information gained from these studies will provide important
new insights into the control of cell-cycle progression, and will thereby enhance our understanding of diseases,
such as cancer, in which cell-cycle control or chromosome segregation is defective. These studies will also
illuminate general regulatory mechanisms of major importance throughout cell biology and human disease."

specific aims, to: 1) Expand the knowledge base and practice of collaborative teams to advance the conduct
of translational research through team-based innovation. Building on our team science leadership, we will test,
learn, and disseminate multi-institutional teaming to enhance the quality, efficiency, effectiveness, and diversity
of clinical and translational research. 2) Engage local, regional, and national stakeholders to make research more
effective at meeting their needs. We will build upon our relationships to extend inter-institutional partnerships, and
to work with stakeholders to disseminate scientific findings and advance the field of community engagement. 3)
Harness the potential of harmonized large data platforms across the translational spectrum to improve research
efficiency, develop technologies to support research teams, and share resources with researchers across the
CTSA network. Our aims are designed to enhance our informatics infrastructure and training with regional and
CTSA network interoperability putting existing and novel analytics tools into the hands of users. 4) Promote
clinical and translational research across the lifespan including special populations. We will expand upon our
significant strengths in multi-site trials in special populations to proactively engage the NCATS Trial Innovation
Network for new trials originating from UTMB. 5) Improve training for a diverse workforce in the authentic skills
needed to advance all phases of clinical and translational research. Our integrated U, K, and T programs will
include participants with diverse professional and educational experience, as well as diverse age, gender, racial,
and ethnic characteristics. 6) Develop and disseminate improved methods and processes for translation from
discovery to improved health. We will apply a continuous improvement approach to understand barriers, develop
effective interventions, and disseminate improvements in translational science and operations.

Payer coverage and economic value continue to be critical factors in determining whether genomic medicine is
appropriately and efficiently implemented into clinical care and health policies. However, genomic tests are
now emerging that present particularly difficult challenges for coverage and value determinations because they
(a) will be used for screening and early detection in asymptomatic populations in addition to disease
management in patients with a condition, and (b) use less-transparent methods, such as algorithmic scores, to
establish linkages between genetic markers and disease.
Our objective is to assess payer coverage decisions and the economic value of two types of
emerging genomic tests for disease management and screening: cell-free DNA tests (cfDNA)
and tests based on polygenic risk scores (PRS). The Specific Aims are:
Aim 1: Examine which cfDNA and PRS tests are covered and why using (a) systematic evidence reviews of
payer coverage policies and (b) structured interviews with payers on how they consider evidence and make
coverage decisions.
Aim 2: Understand the economic value of cfDNA and PRS tests by taking a patient-centered approach,
addressing key methodological challenges, and identifying gaps in evidence.
Aim 3: Compare evidence needs for payer coverage (Aim 1) and economic value assessment (Aim 2) across
clinical scenarios and generalize our findings on evidence needs to other emerging clinical scenarios,
considering patient access and stakeholder perspectives.
This study will provide unique insights by examining multiple clinical scenarios and both coverage and
economic value. All Aims will be framed around the implications of our findings for patient access and
disparities and consideration of stakeholder perspectives within a rapidly changing health care policy and
delivery ecosystem. Study outcomes will identify key factors that determine positive coverage, what evidence is
needed and how it can be prioritized to develop appropriate coverage and value assessments, how patient-
centered and advanced modeling approaches can be applied across clinical scenarios, and how coverage and
value assessments can take into account patient access and disparities and diverse stakeholder perspectives.
Study findings will contribute to the overarching objectives of systematic development of practices and policies
that are appropriate, efficient, and equitable irrespective of whether the tests are covered or shown to have
economic value. Our findings will be useful across stakeholders and will facilitate the development of policies
and practices that will help patients have appropriate, efficient access to testing."

Skin appendages, including teeth, hair, eccrine and mammary glands, are conspicuous and medically impor-
tant features of the human integument. Congenital and acquired disorders of skin appendages are common
and frequently debilitating conditions. Although human genetic analyses and clinical dermatology have associ-
ated numerous loci with skin appendage disorders, the molecular etiologies linking genetic lesions to human
phenotypes in many cases remain obscure. Understanding molecular mechanisms that regulate skin ap-
pendage patterning and morphogenesis in experimental model systems provides new avenues for developing
therapies for skin disease. Indeed, research on chicken and mouse model systems has greatly advanced our
understanding of the genetic regulation of skin appendage development and has already impacted clinical
dermatology. Importantly, patterning cues, morphogenetic cell behaviors and the regulatory mechanisms that
link them are conserved in zebraﬁsh skin appendage development. Because skin appendages form superﬁcial-
ly in the transparent skin of developing ﬁsh, studying zebraﬁsh skin patterning and morphogenesis enables in
vivo analysis of cellular and molecular dynamics at resolutions not currently possible in other model systems.
Studies in Aim 1 will contribute to our understanding of how the correct distribution of skin appendages is
achieved by leveraging live imaging and conditional genetics to test the role of a novel population of migratory
dermal cells likely to regulate skin appendage patterning. These studies will also uncover, for the ﬁrst time,
molecular mechanisms that govern dermal cell migration in intact vertebrate skin. Studies in Aim 2 will eluci-
date mechanisms regulating the dynamic spatial distribution of signaling proteins known to be necessary for
epithelial–mesenchymal interactions during early skin appendage morphogenesis in humans. By using condi-
tional transgene expression to re-construct signaling networks in a zebraﬁsh model of hereditary ectodermal
dysplasia, these experiments will reveal mechanisms governing epithelial–mesenchymal signaling interactions
at molecular resolution. Together, these studies will address some of the most important unanswered questions
regarding skin appendage development and provide potential inroads to understanding the molecular etiology
of human disorders affecting these tissues.

 Current influenza (flu) vaccination based on hypervariable hemagglutinin (HA) protein fails to provide
effective cross protection. The efficacy of vaccination is low in the aged populations even with pre-existing
immunity. The impacts of pre-existing immunity on the immunogenicity and efficacy of universal and seasonal
vaccination largely remain not well understood in the aged populations. Development of new flu vaccines and
vaccination strategies improving cross protective efficacy in young naïve and aged hosts with pre-existing
immunity is of high priority. Mono conserved antigenic targets inducing cross protection tested in naïve animal
models include the flu A virus M2 extracellular domain (M2e), HA-stalk domains, and neuraminidase (NA) were
reported but insufficient for translation to humans. The multi-target universal vaccines in naïve and aged hosts
with pre-existing immunity remain to be developed.
 We developed heterologous tandem repeat of M2e (5xM2e) presented on immunogenic virus-like
particles (5xM2e VLP). Vaccination with 5xM2e VLP was effective in broadening cross protection but
suboptimal. A further improved universal vaccine should be developed. Our preliminary studies found
synergistic effects on improving cross protection by both M2e and NA immunity. Therefore, as a new universal
vaccine candidate, we developed a multi NA + 5xM2e VLP vaccine containing multi-subtype NA and 5xM2e on
the same VLP particle. In addition, we newly designed genetically linked novel recombinant M2e-stalk
universal protein vaccines effectively inducing both M2e and HA-stalk immunity and conferring broad cross-
group protection. Adjuvanted universal vaccination will overcome the aging-related immune senescence by
activating T and B immune cells in naïve hosts or aged populations under pre-existing immunity.
 In this project, we will test the hypothesis that new universal vaccination inducing multi immunity (M2e,
Stalk, NA) will enhance the breadth and efficacy of cross protection in adult and aged populations with or
without pre-existing immunity. Under Aim 1, we will determine the efficacy of multi-target universal vaccines in
young adult mice and ferrets under naïve and pre-existing immune conditions. In Aim 2 studies, we will
determine the durability of cross protective immunity by multi targeting new universal vaccines and test a
vaccination strategy enhancing cross protection in aged mouse and ferret animal models. In the Aim 3, we will
investigate cross protective immune mechanisms of multi targeting universal vaccination in young and aged
mouse models. The outcomes in this project will be highly significant in the aspect of translational science and
relevance to improve the cross protective efficacy of flu vaccination."

 The overall objective of the T32 “Translational Vision Research Training at UCSD” program is to train
postdoctoral fellows to be become outstanding translational vision research scientists. The program builds on
the exceptional training record of faculty from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine
(ranked among the top 10 institutions for NIH Training grants) in general, and the Shiley Eye Institute in
particular who have mentored scientists to translate basic science results into improved clinical care.
Moreover, UCSD is highly collaborative with strong programmatic support for the translation of vision research
from bench to bedside in areas such as genetics/proteomics, clinical research, bioengineering, ophthalmic
imaging and image analysis, drug delivery, and data science, biomedical informatics and artificial intelligence.
 The short-term objectives of the T32 Training Grant program are to provide 2 postdoctoral fellows each
year with training and instruction by mentors who direct NIH-funded laboratories. The program will provide a
coordinated framework for the recruitment and training of postdoctoral fellows in three trainings tracks that
focus on the Shiley Eye Institute and UCSD faculty's core strengths, (1) clinical/human subjects research and
(2) genomics/proteomics and 3) data science/informatics/artificial intelligence. Each Training Track has an
integrated mentor group, with an outstanding track record in training full-time postdoctoral scientists, and
National Eye Institute support for their research. Twenty-two faculty mentors representing 11 UCSD
departments, the Institute of Genomic Medicine and the new Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute will participate in
the program. The program benefits from resources provided by the Clinical Translational Research Institute,
Vision Research Center core grant, the UCSD Supercomputer Center. The multi-disciplinary vision research
training experience includes didactic instruction appropriate to the area being studied, research experience
with a lead mentor as well as professional development seminars, lectures and journal clubs in various
disciplines. Instruction in research ethics and leadership, laboratory management, and grant writing will be
required. To oversee the training program, solicit and review applications, and monitor/facilitate progress
through each postdoctoral fellow's Individual Development Plan (IDP), the administrative structure of the
training program includes a Program Director, Linda Zangwill, PhD, co-Director, Radha Ayyagari, PhD and an
Executive Committee. In addition, an External Advisory Committee provides independent evaluation of the
training program. Every postdoctoral fellow in the T32 Translational Vision Research Training Program at
UCSD will be expected to exit well prepared for a vision research career in academia or industry."
10808201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The primary objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AAV-
mediated gene therapy for preventing the progressive retinal and central nervous system (CNS)
degeneration in a canine model of CLN2 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), particularly as they
relate to functional vision. CLN2 disease results from deficiency of the soluble lysosomal enzyme
tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) caused by mutations in TPP1. Dachshunds with a null mutation in
TPP1 were used in preclinical studies that supported development of CNS enzyme replacement
therapy (ERT) that has been successful in preserving neurological function in affected children.
Unfortunately, this treatment does not prevent retinal degeneration or the resulting blindness in
CLN2 disease. In addition, ERT treatments require long clinic-bases intracerebroventricular
injections every other week for life. Using the dog model, studies will be conducted to test the
hypothesis that combined one-time intravitreal and intra-cerebrospinal fluid administration of AAV-
TPP1 gene therapy vectors will prevent retinal degeneration and degeneration of the visual centers
of the CNS and preserve functional vision, setting the stage for testing this treatment in children
with CLN2 disease."
10893310,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a common mechanism for relaying essential information in animal cells, and
many cancers are driven by aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation events. This protein modification is mediated by
two classes of enzymes: tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases, which phosphorylate and
dephosphorylate, respectively, thousands of different proteins. Many tyrosine kinases are extremely well-
characterized and are the targets of numerous clinically-approved cancer therapies. By contrast, most tyrosine
phosphatases are not biochemically well-characterized, and in particular, we do not know the specific
proteins that many of these enzymes dephosphorylate. Despite this dearth of knowledge, we known that a
few tyrosine phosphatases directly contribute to cancer signaling, and genetic evidence suggests that many
more are likely to be important cancer drivers, tumor suppressors, or modulators of the immune response against
cancer cells. In order to elucidate the precise roles of individual tyrosine phosphatases in cellular processes, we
need tools to rapidly and reliable identify their substrates. Here, we propose a strategy to identify direct
substrates of tyrosine phosphatases in live cells, by combining protein engineering and mass
spectrometry-based proteomics.
A major challenge in the identification of tyrosine phosphatase substrates is that their interactions with their
cognate enzymes are weak and transient, making them difficult to isolate from complex proteomic mixtures. To
solve this problem, we will use genetic code expansion to introduce light-activatable crosslinkers into
tyrosine phosphatases. In Aim 1, we will combine structural and evolutionary information to identify ideal
positions on tyrosine phosphatases to place photo-crosslinkers, such that they do not perturb phosphatase
function but can irreversibly capture a substrate when exposed to UV light. We will test out candidate positions
on a model tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B, with three different photo-crosslinkers. In Aim 2, we will examine the
generality of our best designs by testing them on several tyrosine phosphatases and an array substrates. In Aim
3, we will establish methods to express the engineered tyrosine phosphatases in live mammalian cells, induce
the capture of substrates with UV light, and identify those substrates using mass spectrometry. We will compare
our strategy to the current state-of-the-art method, which relies on mutations in tyrosine phosphatases that
significantly disrupt their function and only modestly stabilize their interactions with substrates.
Successful development of our photo-crosslinking method will enable efficient identification of the
substrates of any tyrosine phosphatases in virtually any cell line of interest. This technique could be used
to delineate the roles of individual tyrosine phosphatases in cancer signaling and cancer-relevant immunity."

The goal of this project is a develop a non-contact, non-invasive clinical tool to characterize, image and
monitor skin grafting procedures using quantitative, volumetric, sub-mm resolved maps of Young's
modulus based on Optical Coherence Elastography (OCE).
Factors related to or directly defined by skin's elastic properties (such as contractions and shearing forces) are
among the most common complications of full thickness skin graft (FTSG) procedures. In addition, the recipient
site functions best when its elastic properties are matched by transplanted donor tissue. With tens of millions
of aesthetic procedures performed every year in the USA alone, surgical cosmesis is clearly critical, especially
when procedures are performed on the face, neck or breast. Currently there are no clinical tools, or even
methods, that can quantitatively map skin's Young's modulus and anisotropy in vivo. We propose to map these
parameters in skin using a non-contact, fully non-invasive method, with sub-mm spatial resolution and
nearly in real time. We hypothesize that quantifying skin elasticity in vivo will enable significant innovation within
all areas of plastic surgery, burn surgery, oncologic surgery, and dermatology that modify a patient's tissue
quality and elastic properties through medical, radiologic, or surgical intervention.
To achieve our objective, we propose a new non-contact OCE method. Our approach is based on: (i) acoustic
micro-tapping (AµT) using ultrasound propagating in air to launch mechanical waves in soft media with the
highest efficiency and best resolution among all non-contact wave-excitation methods, (ii) state-of-the-art real-
time 4-D PhS-OCT imaging to track wave propagation, and (iii) reconstruction of volumetric maps of Young's
modulus and anisotropy using imaged wavefields in skin analyzed with a transversally isotropic model.
SA1 will focus on refining previously developed analytic and numerical models of mechanical wave
propagation in skin considering its layered anisotropic structure, and developing algorithms to reconstruct
skin's moduli. Then, SA2 will develop a robotized AµT-OCE imaging system for in vivo skin measurements in
a clinical environment. We will perform routine measurements of skin elastic moduli in vivo on healthy
volunteers to understand normal variability in skin elastic properties in a representative population of normal
human subjects to help define the level of expected improvements possible in matching skin elastic properties
in FTSG procedures. SA3 will focus on in vivo monitoring changes in grafted skin elastic properties during
grafting procedures in the clinic, including pre-operative mapping of skin's elastic properties in donor and
recipient sites and mapping longitudinal changes in fundamental structural and elastic parameters of FTSGs
and surrounding tissue over the reconstruction process. If successful, this project can be the starting point for
multiple continuation projects testing whether new methods and clinical protocols can be developed using
information from OCE to help select the best donor tissue for grafting and guide post-surgery procedures."

is a critical shortage of physician-scientists in child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) to address this significant
problem. Unfortunately, there are a dearth of programs that provide significant research training, forcing CAP
fellows who desire a research career to commit to an additional 2-3 years of postgraduate research training
beyond their CAP fellowship. This proposed R25-funded Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Research Training
Track (CAP-RTT) will fill this critical training gap and national need. It will train the next generation of physician-
scientists in CAP research and accelerate their trajectories to independent, productive research careers. This
two year program, with an optional third year, will pair substantial dedicated research time with excellent
clinical training in our CAP fellowship. Our Division provides an ideal setting to combine superb research and
clinical training. Our CAP fellowship and Triple Board Program have a long history of attracting excellent
trainees providing unparalleled training. We have a pool of potential CAP researchers for the CAP-RTT. The
number of research-oriented residents potentially available to our program, stimulated this application. In 2019,
the Division received more than $15 million for active grants (representing over $38 million in all years of
funding for those projects). The Division's pioneering research in psychopathology, children's sleep, infant
development, psychophysiology, and HIV clinical interventions has translated into new and effective treatments
for children and their families. Other areas of interest include neuroscience, genetics, social science,
prevention, health disparities, and health services research. Our faculty are skilled mentors in the Division's
two NIMH T32 programs and participate in many other research training programs at Brown. Our program will
combine an intensive longitudinal mentored research experience with an individualized research didactic
curriculum and career development activities in a rich, multidisciplinary environment. The program will contain
substantial protected research time, individualized mentored research training, a specialized didactic research
curriculum, career development experiences for trainees, and a comprehensive evaluation component of the
fellows and the program."
10888370,"Multicenter clinical trials face numerous challenges including recruitment, lack of clinical trial expertise, and inefficiencies in IRB approval and contracting. The Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (NeuroNEXT) has addressed these by organizing 25 research sites and central Data and Clinical Coordinating centers, each with significant expertise in clinical trial design and performance and access to a broad range of content experts. NeuroNEXT has a Central IRB (cIRB) and master trial agreement (MTA) that increases startup efficiency. NeuroNEXT has completed 8 trials, and three more are active. The Utah Regional site in the Network for Excellence in Neuroscience Clinical Trials (UR-NEXT) is the NeuroNEXT clinical research site serving the five state Intermountain West. UR-NEXT is centered at University Utah Health (UUH). UUH has the only integrated neuroscience center in the region. Primary Children's Hospital (PCH) is the only children's hospital and serves as partner. UR-NEXT also includes the Salt Lake City Veteran's Administration Health System (SLCVAHS), the anchoring center for VISN 19, and Intermountain Health Care (IHC), which operates PCH. Together these systems provide medical services to more than 80% of the 10 million covered lives in the region. UR-NEXT benefits from an established network of referring community neurologists with interest in clinical trials, the Western Intermountain Neurological Organization (WINO). The Neurology Department has Divisions in each major subspecialty with substantial expertise in the management and performance of multicenter trials. UR-NEXT shares leadership with, and benefits from a close collaborative relationship with the NCATS funded Utah Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute. UR-NEXT leadership and UUH programs provide deep expertise in rare diseases and genetic therapies that will benefit the NeuroNEXT consortium. The UUH IRB is responsible for PCH and VAHS, and leads cIRB development for the CTSA nationally, while the Office of Sponsored Projects has experience with master trial agreements. UR-NEXT has been highly engaged and successful as a NeuroNEXT site during this funding period. Utah participated in 5 of 6 protocols since 2017 and was the top enrollment site in two of the past four years, the fourth highest enrolling site over the NeuroNEXT lifespan, with 100% retention of participants during the current funding period. UR- NEXT led administration of NN-108, analyzed intraepidermal nerve fiber density as the co-primary endpoint and reviewed all study nerve conduction studies. Stacey Clardy is PDPI for NN-111 ExTINGUISH, an inpatient trial of inebilizumab for treatment of autoimmune encephalitis, which began enrolling in 2022. UR-NEXT includes a Career Enhancement Plan that supports a yearly UR-NEXT Fellowship which is awarded to a promising early career neurosciences faculty investigator interested in clinical trials.

Research during the last funding period of this NIGMS-funded MIRA award has
significantly advanced understanding of the molecular immunobiology mechanisms at the
interface between the nervous system and the immune system. As reported in a series of
high impact publications, our lab's discoveries of vagus nerve control of inflammation,
termed “the inflammatory reflex,” the elucidation of the specific neural and molecular
mechanisms, culminated in successful clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's
disease. This NIGMS MIRA-supported work of basic immunobiology programs focuses on
the anatomy, electrophysiology, and molecular mechanisms of the vagus nerve circuits
controlling innate immunity. It is credited with establishing and leading the field of
bioelectronic medicine. The present competing renewal proposes a logical, significant,
innovative, and impactful continuation of this work delineating how the brain controls
immunity. There remain many major unanswered questions. For example, what is the
origin, anatomy, and function in the brain of neural signals that control inflammation? How
does the brain sense and record the presence of inflammation in the body? And, what are
the brain and nervous system mechanisms that stimulate inflammation? Some of these
questions will be answered directly, and other new questions will likely arise during the
course of work to guide additional exploration. The PI and his lab have assembled and
lead teams to accomplish this work. They have the necessary experience and a track
record in using optogenetics, transgenic, and knock-out mice, immunological disease
models, imaging technologies, electro- and neuro-physiology methods, and basic
immunology and neurobiology. They are in an ideal environment to successfully complete
the proposed studies, both to advance the MIRA mission of NIGMS, and to continue their
journey translating basic science into clinical investigation and practice."
11169382,"Project Abstract:
National trauma center verification relies on a commitment to injury prevention efforts, including against
community-level violence. Hospital-Based Violence Recovery Programs (HVIPs) have expanded across the
country as extensions of Level I and II trauma centers to address trauma recidivism with individual behavioral
modification during the “teachable moment”. There is no evidence to date that has demonstrated effectiveness
in this approach for HVIPs, despite proliferation across the country. A criticism of this approach to violence
prevention is the difficulty for community-based violence prevention specialists from HVIP programs to address
the larger inequities in the Structural and Social Determinants of Health (SSDOH) that lead to violence through
individual behavior modification. Medical-Legal Partnerships have been one approach that has demonstrated
evidence and success in improving health outcomes and reducing health-harming legal needs of patients, by
connecting legal experts to medical experts for holistic care. This has yet to be done for trauma patients and
has, to our knowledge, not been incorporated into any HVIP approach thus far, for a Medical-Legal Partnership
(MLP). In our biphasic proposal, our UG3 aims are to clearly identify the types of health-harming legal needs of
our patients and families affected by firearm violence and examine the population-level differences in types of
legal needs by sociodemographic and geographic factors. We them aim to develop the HVIP-MLP model for
implementation at our urban, Level I Trauma Center on the South Side of Chicago. Our UH3 aims would be to
then examine implementation outcomes (acceptability and feasibility) of our novel MLP compared to standard of
care with our HVIP. We would then examine health outcomes via a pragmatic clinical trial measuring primary
health outcomes (stress and health-related quality of life) and secondary, validated SSDOH outcomes
[improvements in income, housing & utilities, employment, legal needs and personal & family stability (I-HELP)].
As a developmental exploratory aim, we will also measure stress and health-related quality of life in our HVIP-
affiliated violence recovery specialists that engage their patients in the MLP model, as well access the
intervention themselves, as needed. Close coordination with the CLIP-VP Coordinating Center will be essential
specifically for data handling, measurement, analytics support and consultation with future public/stakeholder
engagement and dissemination to demonstrate our public health impact. This novel HVIP-MLP approach has
the potential to broadly impact the HVIP model to include an MLP component to all trauma centers for verification
to support patients, families and providers alike in this important public health work."

The importance of mucosal healing in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) derives from clinical data that
demonstrate it to be a predictor of remission1. Thus, ulcer healing predicts the capacity for therapies to prevent
unwanted clinical sequelae (i.e. surgery). Unfortunately, many IBD patients remain refractory or lose
responsiveness to therapies leading to persistent mucosal ulceration. Prospective pediatric studies show that
reduced mitochondrial gene expression predict unfavorable outcomes in ulcerative colitis (UC)2. These findings
were supported by Kugathasan et al who found that increased expression of mitochondrial respiratory chain
genes predicted favorable (B1 protected) Crohn’s disease (CD) outcomes3. Based on these results and our
own data, we hypothesize that a critical driver of chronic ulceration in IBD is the failure of intestinal
epithelial cells (IEC) to increase mitochondrial respiration with ROS generation. We posit that chronic
mucosal inflammation suppresses mitochondrial respiration needed for crypt fissioning (in ulcer healing) in
IBD. This hypothesis will be tested in the following studies: Aim 1. Determine the impact of
mitochondrial respiration for mucosal healing. These studies benefit from strikingly novel Prelim.
Data using VilCre/mTmG/TFAMfl/fl mice where mitochondrial respiration was shown to be required for
crypt fissioning in ulcer healing. In Aim 2 we will determine the requirement of mitochondrial-
derived ROS in IEC crypt division using primary human colonoids. Aim 3 studies will determine
the impact of chronic inflammation on ulcer healing in patients. IEC transcriptomics from ulcer
edges from CD and ulcerative colitis will be compared to normal ulcer healing. Normal ulcer healing
will be interrogated using a novel biopsy of a biopsy (Bx/Bx) approach (IEC will be isolated from
Bx/Bx sites 4-6day after initial biopsies). ScRNAseq results have already shown that mitochondrial
biogenesis (PGC1) increases in Bx/Bx ulcers whereas levels drop in IBD IEC. In summary: Studies
will investigate the cause of non-healing ulceration in IBD by interrogating novel murine, human
and in vitro colonoid culture models of determining the impact of suppressed mitochondrial respiration
on IEC responses (crypt fissioning). The studies will test the notion that chronic mucosal
inflammation (as in IBD) suppresses mitochondrial respiration which impedes ROS-induced
PI3K signaling and crypt fissioning. Our goal is to identify therapeutic targets to allow for enhanced
mitochondrial respiration to aide mucosal repair in IBD.

Sphingolipids not only are essential structural components of eukaryotic membranes, but also function as
signaling molecules and mediate many biological processes. Defects in sphingolipid metabolism are often
associated with cancers and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite the importance of bioactive sphingolipids,
molecular mechanisms of their biogenesis and homeostasis remain poorly understood. In humans, the first and
rate-limiting step of sphingolipid biosynthesis is catalyzed by the serine palmitoyltransferase complex, which
consists of catalytic component SPTLCs and regulatory components ssSPT and ORMDL. This key enzyme
complex also senses cellular sphingolipid levels to adjust sphingolipid production accordingly, making it a
critical feedback regulator in maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis. Human mutations in the complex lead to
hereditary sensory neuropathy and early-onset amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the mechanism and
regulation of the complex are unclear. We propose to elucidate 1) the substrate recognition and catalytic
reaction of the complex, 2) the role of regulatory components, and 3) the sphingolipid-sensing and feedback
mechanism. To accomplish these aims, we will combine high-resolution structural biology, biochemistry, and
biophysics to provide structural and mechanistic insights into sphingolipid biogenesis and homeostasis
governed by the serine palmitoyltransferase complex. Our proposed studies will greatly advance our
understanding of sphingolipid biology by uncovering the molecular basis of an essential step in sphingolipid
biogenesis and a mechanism of sphingolipid homeostasis."

The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) region on human chromosome 6p21 is the most medically important region of the
human genome. More than 100 infectious, autoimmune and pharmacological disease phenotypes and cancers are associated
with genetic variation of HLA. Nevertheless, despite nearly a half-century of study investigating HLA and disease
association, outstanding questions remain regarding the full extent of HLA mediated impact on human health and disease.
A major limitation to these studies, lack of sufficient sample size for discovery and replication, can be attributed to the
complex nature of the HLA region such that it is often impractical to undertake association studies in very large cohorts. To
date, nearly all large-scale studies examining HLA variation in human health have relied on statistical imputation of HLA
alleles from SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) data, rather than direct genotyping of these loci. Here, we propose to
exploit pre-existing, high-quality HLA genotyping data collected by the National Marrow Donor Program in order to
examine the impact of HLA variation in human health and immunity at unprecedented scale. We will collect self-reported
health histories from a sample of greater than 100,000 individuals, allowing examination of genotype-phenotype
associations with high-resolution genotypes. Further, we will examine the relationship between HLA variation and antibody
response to human cytomegalovirus (CMV) in more than 1,000,000 individuals. To provide context to the association
studies, we will examine the relationship between HLA variation and antigenic targets of antibodies in more than 1000
healthy individuals. In Specific Aim 1 we will build a very large dataset collected through the National Marrow Donor
Program (NMDP) to identify potential HLA associations across numerous diseases and phenotypes in a Phenome Wide
Association study (PheWAS). Phenotype information for PheWAS analysis will be obtained from self-report survey data
for approximately 130 conditions, diseases and traits from subjects with HLA genotyping collected by NMDP. In Specific
Aim 2 we will determine the antigen specificity of antibodies in serum samples from healthy subjects, stratified by HLA
genotype. We will utilize a programmable phage display assay, comprised of 744,000 peptides tiled across the human
proteome, representing the entire human peptidome. Additionally, we will screen against the phage display for the virome
(480,000 peptides) for specificity for viral antigens, and test binding of these antigens to HLA molecules. We will examine
serum samples from over 1000 healthy donors. In Specific Aim 3, we will specifically address serostatus with respect to
human cytomegalovirus (CMV) in a sample of over a million individuals. CMV is ubiquitous in all human populations and
infection can have profound effects on the immune system. This analysis will provide the first large-scale examination of
the association of HLA variation with CMV serostatus. Across multiple elements of human health and immunity, the key
feature of this study is the extraordinarily large sample size projected for each of our aims, made possible through our
leveraging of existing high-resolution HLA genotyping data. In doing so, we will extend our understanding of the effect of
these important immune loci in human health across a wide range of conditions, across multiple ancestries reflective of the
United States population."

Osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA) cumulatively affect more than 40 million Americans. Both OP and OA
are underdiagnosed and undertreated because of the limited accuracy of existing tools for diagnosis and
treatment monitoring. The need for improved biomarkers of OP and OA spurred interest in quantitative evaluation
of texture features of cancellous bone derived from radiography, CT, and MRI. In such “bone radiomics”, image
texture provides an indirect assessment of the trabecular geometry (≤100 µm detail size) that is better suited to
the limited resolution of diagnostic imaging modalities than the direct measurements used in e.g. micro-CT. Initial
clinical validation of textural bone biomarkers showed promising performance in prediction of vertebral failure
and progression of OA. However, rigorous investigation of how the image formation process affects textural
biomarkers is essential to establish standardized protocols for imaging and analysis in bone radiomics –
especially in light of emerging technologies for high-resolution imaging. Recently, new CT scanners with ~2x
improved spatial resolution compared to conventional CT have been introduced by major manufacturers,
including the Canon Precision system that will be used in this project. This new generation of ultra-high resolution
CT (UHR CT) is capable of visualizing ~150 µm details, approaching the trabecular thickness and thus potentially
enabling a breakthrough in in-vivo evaluation of bone micorarchitecture. We hypothesize that the improved
spatial resolution of UHR CT will lead to better quantitative performance of bone radiomics than normal resolution
CT (NR CT) or x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). To establish the clinical utility of bone radiomics using UHR-CT, the
following Aims will be pursued: 1) Perform the first comprehensive assessment of the sensitivity of CT-based
texture features of bone to key components of the CT imaging chain (e.g., scan and reconstruction protocol)
using a high-fidelity CT simulator and experimental studies in bone core samples. We will establish UHR and
NR CT features that are correlated to trabecular geometry and reproducible with respect to body size and dose.
2) Demonstrate improved prediction of trabecular stiffness using UHR CT texture features. Multivariate
regression between stiffness and texture bone features investigated in Aim 1 will be performed for ~300 bone
cores using UHR CT and NR CT. We will demonstrate improved stiffness estimates with UHR CT compared to
NR CT. 3) Perform a clinical pilot of UHR CT-based texture features in longitudinal monitoring of OP treatment.
We will acquire longitudinal UHR CT and DXA of 20 spine fusion patients being treated with OP drug to optimize
their bone quality. We will demonstrate that radiomic features from UHR CT detect changes in bone quality
earlier than DXA. We will also investigate the feasibility of bone radiomics in prediction of fusion outcomes.
Successful completion of the Aims will establish quantitative UHR CT-based bone radiomics as a novel tool for
in-vivo assessment of bone health in OA and OP, with downstream reduction of patient morbidity and mortality."

Candida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen responsible for invasive, often multidrug-resistant infections and
outbreaks worldwide. Unlike for many other fungal pathogens, C. auris infection is primarily nosocomial, driven
by the propensity of C. auris to robustly colonize medical devices, implants, and abiotic surfaces that are
proximal to patient quarters. C. auris can survive on abiotic surfaces for weeks, and many strains are resistant
to commonly used antifungals and disinfectants, hindering decontamination efforts. The importance of this
colonization to C. auris disease spread is demonstrated by intervention case studies associating reduction of
infection incidence with removal of colonized fomites. C. auris can also form biofilms on surfaces, likely
contributing to its resistance to decontamination. On a molecular scale, these processes require the initial first
step of individual fungal cells physically attaching to a surface. While the regulation of attachment has been
explored to a limited extent in related fungal species, no mechanistic studies have investigated the molecular
machinery governing initial attachment in C. auris. Furthermore, while C. auris encodes genes homologous to
characterized Candida albicans ALS and IFF/HYR family adhesins, proteins which have been implicated in
attachment in other fungal species, our findings indicate none of these genes substantially contributes to
attachment to abiotic surfaces in C. auris. Instead, we have identified B9J08_001458, a novel class of adhesin
specifically encoded by C. auris with no characterized homologs. Deletion of B9J08_001458 substantially and
significantly reduces C. auris adhesion. Furthermore, our preliminary findings suggest natural transcriptional
variation of B9J08_001458 among C. auris isolates is linked to natural variation in adhesive potential. The goal
of this proposal is to identify the functional and regulatory mechanisms of C. auris adhesion and explain the
variability in adhesion in different C. auris clinical isolates. Our hypothesis is that C. auris regulates an
adhesive cell surface profile primarily through expression of the putative novel adhesin B9J08_001458,
and that transcriptional control of this adhesin explains adhesive variation amongst C. auris isolates.
To address this hypothesis, we will leverage our global genetic and transcriptomic datasets to identify
transcription factors targeting B9J08_001458. Our findings also suggest B9J08_001458 is regulated through
the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex; we will characterize this layer of transcriptional regulation by
comparing chromatin states between wild type cells and mutants deficient in SWI/SNF function. We will then
investigate the impact of genetic variants driving differential expression of B9J08_001458 amongst diverse C.
auris isolates using genome wide association studies. The findings of this proposal will provide a scientific
foundation for the rational development of decontamination and infection control protocols against C. auris,
potentially mitigating the disease burden of this fungus."

Composite tissue regeneration is very limited in mammals; however, humans and mice can fully regenerate
the distal tips of the digits following amputation. This process involves the formation of a blastema, a cellular
structure that is the source of the regenerated tissue and is integral to successful regeneration. Proximal
amputations beyond the nail do not form a blastema and result in fibrotic wound-healing. This differential
behavior makes the mouse digit tip an ideal model system to investigate the cellular and molecular factors
driving each wound-healing response and why complex regeneration is so limited in mammals. Specifically,
this project will focus on fibroblast subtypes and their role in fibrosis versus regeneration. Fibroblasts are a
major contributor to the blastema and play an integral part in fibrosis; thus, they may be a cell population
that drives the decision between fibrosis and regeneration. Our single cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq)
analysis of the regenerating blastema revealed an extremely heterogenous fibroblast population and that
the subpopulations had distinct population dynamics and lineage trajectories during blastema formation and
maturation. I hypothesize that there are specific fibroblast subtypes that promote regeneration, inhibit
fibrosis, or both. However, no studies have performed direct lineage contributions by tracing fibroblast
subpopulations in regeneration and fibrosis. Additionally, the in vivo functional roles and importance of our
computationally defined candidate pro-regenerative genes have not been established. This project will utilize
single-cell CRISPR based DNA barcoding for lineage tracing fibroblasts at the subtype resolution (Aim 1)
and plasmid electroporation for gene delivery to functionally assess candidate pro-regenerative genes (Aim
2). Together, my two aims will provide important insight into how the fibrotic and regenerative processes are
determined in the mouse digit tip and will open additional avenues for more effective clinical treatments for
large wounds or amputations in humans."

Lung diseases and syndromes caused by respiratory pathogens represent a leading cause of death worldwide.
Each year, influenza infections result in a significant number of fatalities, a majority of which are complicated by
secondary bacterial super-infection. Primary influenza infection has been shown to increase susceptibility to
secondary methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection by altering the pulmonary host immune
response and damaging the lung epithelial barrier, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Macrophages,
both lung-resident and those recruited to the lung, are important in super-infection resolution as they engulf,
degrade, and present bacterial antigen to adaptive immune cells, ultimately leading to activation of type 17 cells,
which promote pathogen clearance. While the role of interferon-(IFN)α/β during super-infection has been well
characterized, type III IFNs have not been as extensively studied within the context of the lung. Data shows that
IFNα/β are involved in type 17 attenuation after primary influenza infection, which may indicate that IFNλ exhibits
similar inhibitory functions due to overlapping signaling pathways, although the potential for unique functions on
lung cells is unresolved.
Our lab has preliminary data suggesting that administration of exogenous IFNλ during super-infection reduces
bacterial uptake by neutrophils and monocyte-derived cells, but the specific cell subsets impacted are unknown.
I hypothesize that lung-resident macrophages are sensitive to IFNλ and that IFNλ signaling impairs
phagocytosis and the type 17 immune response during super-infection. In the proposed studies, I will
determine which myeloid subsets express the IFNλ receptor (IFNLR1) and identify how intact or disrupted IFNλ
signaling broadly impacts lung injury and resolution after infection. More specifically, these experiments will
determine how IFNλ impacts MRSA uptake and the initiation of a type 17 immune response during super-
infection. IFNλ administration has been considered for therapeutic potential, and the outcomes of this proposal
will shed light on potential caveats to the use of IFNλ as a possible treatment method during super-infection.
Further, demonstration of the effects of IFNλ on myeloid cells will potentially be applicable to several other
settings where an antiviral interferon response is observed."

The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has resulted in the loss of over 6 million lives worldwide. Since then,
there has been an intense focus on the development of vaccines and clinical treatments to increase the
survivability of the disease caused by this virus. However, in nature other diverse sarbecoviruses circulate
which may present future spillover potential and for which these treatments may be ineffective. Clade 3
sarbecoviruses originate in Africa and Europe, outside of the regions considered to be sarbecovirus hotspots in
Southeast Asia. The geographical location and the absence of native human ACE2 utilization from the earliest
viruses discovered in this clade resulted in this clade being discounted. However, we have recently shown that
one member of this clade, BtKY72 from Kenya, has the capacity to gain human ACE2 binding within one
amino acid mutation and cellular entry within two mutations. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time
that another member of this clade, Khosta-2 from Russia, can natively bind human ACE2 as a wildtype
sequence. Together, our recent observations indicate the need to develop tools to study and inhibit potential
human infection by this overlooked clade of viruses. Clade 3 may be the origin of a future sarbecovirus
spillover, but current tools might have limited protective capacity due to the genetic divergence between Clade
3 and the prior human sarbecoviruses in the spike protein, the viral surface glycoprotein responsible for
receptor binding and fusion of the viral envelope and the host cell membrane. I hypothesize that all members
of this clade can gain human ACE2 utilization within a couple of mutations in the receptor binding domain of
the spike glycoprotein but that current vaccines and antibody treatments will have reduced efficacy against
clade 3 sarbecoviruses. In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will uncover receptor usage of all current members of clade
3 in Rhinolophus bat species with ranges in Africa, Europe, and Asia identify mutations that enable human
ACE2 binding and cellular entry of these viruses making use of safe non-replicating pseudovirus systems. In
Aim 2, I will establish what clinical tools in terms of vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatments would be
effective at preventing cellular entry of clade 3 sarbecoviruses. Understanding current native receptor usage
combined with a sequence assessment of sarbecoviruses that may be able to coinfect a specific species of
Rhinolophus will give insight into the evolutionary possibilities available to these viruses. In addition,
identification of mutations that enable human ACE2 binding and cellular entry in human cell lines will provide
context on how close these viruses are to achieving this first step necessary for human spillover. Finally, the
assessment of current tools for their effectiveness against clade 3 sarbecoviruses and the structural
characterization of clade 3 spike ectodomains, will give us a head start should these viruses cross the species
barrier in the future."

Referred pain is both understudied in research and poorly understood in the clinic, particularly for patients with
bladder disease. Bladder pain can significantly lessen quality of life, which is amplified by unacknowledged or
improperly treated pain from the skin. Diagnosis of referred bladder or somatic pain is obfuscated by a lack of
obvious pathology, exacerbating the challenges of finding effective therapeutic approaches. Though the root
cause of such referred pain is unknown, it likely relies on visceral and skin afferent interactions, termed
viscerosomatic crosstalk. Mechanisms of referred pain attributed to the spinal cord fail to explain why patients
with pelvic pain have sensory innervation loss of the lower limb skin that is diagnostic for neuropathic pain.
Preliminary data shows that mechanical hypersensitivity in hind paws of mice with bladder inflammation closely
resembles nerve injury phenotypes and reflect patient experiences of lower limb sensitivity from bladder
inflammation or nerve damage. In the peripheral nervous system, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons are
widely diverse in function and in innervating tissue, where injured and uninjured neurons, and their surrounding
satellite glia, undergo changes after injury that drive pain. Viscerosomatic crosstalk between uninjured bladder
or somatic neurons in DRG could be causing referred pain, but there is a dearth of information about bladder
neuron crosstalk in the DRG. Retrograde neuronal tracing studies confirming DRG can co-housing both
bladder and hind paw skin sensory neurons strongly support this possibility. The proposed research will test
the hypothesis that viscerosomatic crosstalk in DRG after injury results in hyperexcitable physiological
responses of the uninjured circuit, mediated by functional changes in their sensory neurons and
altered signaling with satellite glia. To do this, neurophysiology experiments will utilize intact DRGs to
maintain local communication between neurons and satellite glia, including a novel ex vivo preparation that
leaves the mouse sensory circuit from the hind paw skin to the spinal cord intact. Together with molecular
assays of protein expression, experiments will determine the mechanisms driving activation of tracer-labeled
uninjured neurons by probing activation of satellite glia and two key membrane receptors, transient potential
channel V member 1 (TRPV1), also known as the capsaicin receptor, and Purinocepter 3 (P2X3), a widely
studied adenosine triphosphate receptor, both of which are poorly understood in referred pain that results from
bladder inflammation or nerve injury. Aim 1 is designed to investigate how uninjured hind paw neurons are
physiologically altered after acrolein-induced cystitis, and the possibility that these alterations are mediated by
changes in TRPV1 or P2X3. Aim 2 will explore how uninjured bladder sensory neurons are affected by Spared
Nerve Injury, a robust model of lower limb neuropathic pain. Collectively, these data will help elucidate sensory
neuron crosstalk in DRG as a new biological mechanism underlying referred pain in patients with bladder
disease and provide a starting point for improved diagnosis and novel, effective therapeutic approaches."

Project Summary
Howard University's Advancing Diversity in Aging Research (HUADAR) initiative began in 2014 with
the goal of enhancing diversity of the biomedical and clinical research workforce on aging. The
institutional environment at Howard University perfectly justifies the rationales for developing a
HUADAR program at Howard University since it remains committed for more than a century in
training underrepresented minority students. Over the last five years we have successfully fulfilled this
goal by recruiting 44 high achieving students, 93% of them African American. We retained 89%
(39/44) of our initial recruits, with 24 completing their Bachelors degree through May 2019, with
another 15 remaining in the pipeline. So far, nine out of 24 have enrolled in advanced degree
programs in MSTEM (Ph.D., MD, DDS) and MSW, thus fulfilling the goals of NIA as outlined in PAR-
17-290. The remaining 15 graduates are currently pursuing MSTEM interests while preparing to
enter into an advanced degree program. Graduates remain continually in contact with HUADAR and
we are confident that they will pursue various aging related research careers upon completion of their
advance degrees. The proposed training is a structured, mentored, hands-on research and
educational experience over three years. Apart from enrolling in courses on aging, educational
experiences will include two new components: (1) through online forums HUADAR students will
engage in dialogue about latest developments in aging, and (2) discussion session on self-care
management. Aging related research experiences include (1) opportunities to engage in research
during the academic year with HUADAR mentors, (2) summer research apprenticeship opportunities
in leading research institutes on aging, including the National Institutes on Aging (intramural), the
Barshop Institute for Longevity Research, the University of Southern California, and Tulane University
Centre for Aging, (3) opportunities to publish and present at national meetings, and (4) one-on-one
mentoring to build a successful career path. All students and personnel will be required to obtain the
Responsible Conduct of Research certification. To assess our program's efficacy we invited a
third-party evaluation firm, as our External Evaluator. The evaluation plan for HUADAR will consist
of course evaluations, faculty efficacy surveys, summer research experience surveys, retention and
graduation rates, and acceptance rates of HUADAR graduates into graduate and professional
schools, and postgraduate involvement in aging research and geriatric specialties. In this competitive
renewal, we propose to continue our program to fulfill the goal of the NIA ADAR initiative to diversify
the research workforce focused on aging.

10819515,"Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptors depend on each other for normal function and survival.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) lead to irreversible loss of vision in
millions worldwide, due to RPE dysfunction and photoreceptor degeneration. Our long-term goal is to reverse
vision loss by a combined transplant of neural retina sheets containing photoreceptor progenitors, plus a
polarized functional RPE monolayer to support the photoreceptors.
 Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiated into RPE and retina organoids (RO) - which would
substitute for neural retina sheets - can provide an unlimited supply of clinically applicable retinal donor tissue.
Retinal sheet transplants - dissected from hESC-ROs – develop photoreceptors, improve visual acuity,
responses to light, and integrate with the host retina. However, RO’s are generally devoid of a polarized RPE
layer. Therefore, cografting of hESC–derived neural retina and a healthy RPE monolayer is needed for treatment
of advanced disease conditions; but have not been performed on a large scale. To advance cell replacement
therapy, the mechanism of action of the transplant should be well understood. Although synaptic connectivity of
retinal transplants has been ascribed a role for visual improvement, details regarding the circuitry between
transplant and host retina remain unknown. To obtain better insight, retinal degenerate (RD) rats that express a
specific label to identify defined host retinal neuron populations need to be used. Thus, the goal of this project is
to improve the efficiency of transplants and analyze the functional recovery in relationship to neural connectivity.
 The proposed studies are aimed (1): To determine the efficacy of cografting “complete transplants”.
We hypothesize that “complete” transplants consisting of hESC-neural retina together with RPE will improve
visual recovery - compared to transplanting hESC-neural retina or RPE alone. Royal College of Surgeons (RCS)
rats, a model of a hereditary (chronic) RPE defect, at an advanced stage of RD will receive either “cografts”, or
transplants of ROs or RPE alone, and analyzed long-term (6-8 months) after grafting. The successful outcome
of this Aim should allow us to quantitatively evaluate the improved outcome of cografting. (2): To determine
mechanisms of functional recovery by detailing transplant-host connectivity. We hypothesize that visual
improvement will correlate with integration and synaptic connectivity of neural retinal sheet transplants in the
host retina. This will be tested by labels for both the donor and specific retinal neurons of the host retina. In
collaboration with Envigo, we will produce immunodeficient rhodopsin mutant (Rho S334ter-3) RD recipients
expressing Td-Tomato either universally (cre/lox inducible) or in CaMKII retinal neurons (using CRISPR-Cas9
technology), which will allow us to examine in detail the connectivity of RO transplants with specific retinal cell
types in the host retina, and to correlate visual functional improvement with transplant-host connectivity.

10788409,"PROJECT SUMMARY – UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA-CHAPEL HILL, FROHLICH
Cognitive control requires the brain to dynamically allocate limited resources to manipulate internal
representations as a function of behavioral demands, a process referred to as output-gating. Output-gating
comprises two intertwined cognitive processes: the selection of relevant information and the suppression of
irrelevant information. These two cognitive processes have been correlated with oscillatory neuronal network
activity in two distinct frequency bands and network locations: theta oscillations (4-7 Hz) in prefrontal cortex
(PFC) for selection and alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) in posterior parietal cortex for suppression. However, the
causal role of these oscillations and their interactions in output-gating has yet to be established. To address this
gap, this proposal examines the causal role of theta and alpha oscillations in output-gating across multiple scales
with individualized brain stimulation paradigms to provide a mechanistic delineation of how these oscillations
support behavior, coordinate network activity, and regulate neuronal spiking activity. The objective of AIM 1 is to
demonstrate the causal role of theta and alpha oscillations in selection and suppression, respectively. To
accomplish this, theta and alpha frequency rhythmic transcranial magnetic stimulation is applied in healthy
participants to frontal and parietal sites with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) during a working
memory task with a retrospective cue that drives output-gating. The hypothesis of AIM 1 is that frontal theta
activity coordinates the selection of relevant information, while parietal alpha activity coordinates the suppression
of irrelevant information. The objective of AIM 2 is to spatially resolve the theta and alpha network dynamics that
support selection and suppression, respectively. To achieve this objective, direct cortical stimulation combined
with invasive EEG will be used in epilepsy patients with implanted electrodes for clinical purposes. The
hypothesis of AIM 2 is that connectivity between frontal and parietal regions establishes oscillatory dynamics
critical for selection and suppression. The objective of AIM 3 is to determine how oscillatory network dynamics
regulate neuronal spiking activity. This is examined by applying theta and alpha frequency rhythmic optogenetic
stimulation to frontal and parietal sites in the ferret with simultaneous electrophysiology recordings during an
attentional task that modulates theta and alpha oscillations. The hypothesis of AIM 3 is that theta oscillations
increase spiking and alpha oscillations decrease spiking activity. The proposed work is significant since it will
provide a multi-scale mechanistic understanding of how theta and alpha oscillations coordinate output-gating.
The proposed aims are innovative since they employ synergistic causal perturbations through targeted brain
stimulation paradigms with concurrent electrophysiology, enabling the manipulation of oscillatory dynamics and
the delineation of their role in coordinating neuronal spiking, network organization, and behavior. This work will
provide the foundation for the future development of brain stimulation interventions that target impaired brain
network oscillations for the restoration of cognitive deficits in psychiatric illnesses."

pathways. We propose to apply this infrastructure and our expertise to provide decision support for 
stakeholders in seven categories (residential communities, health care providers, pharmaceutical firms, 
manufacturers, regulatory agencies, legislators, and non-governmental organizations. Our twofold mission is a) 
to improve environmental public health and b) to improve the understanding of the relationships among 
environmental exposures, human biology, and disease. The Administrative Core will manage the EHS CC to 
assure that it will achieve its goals and fulfill its commitments. The core will help to focus the EHS CC on the 
Strategic Objectives of NIEHS. An Executive Team formed from the leaders of the Facility Cores, the 
Community Engagement Core (CEC) and the Pilot Projects Program (PPP) will guide the Center. Additionally, 
an experienced External Advisory Committee will provide critical evaluations and guidance to the 
Administrative Core. Our active Internal Advisory Committee will help to steer and implement our center. The 
Administrative Core staff members have many years of experience in solving problems quickly, avoiding

 The Proteostasis Advanced Imaging Core (Core B) referred in the Program Project (PP) text as “Image 
Core” will serve the four projects and the Innovation component of Core D of this PP. 
 The long-term goal is to provide support on image-based studies to understand the cellular and subcellular 
changes in autophagy dynamics during aging and in the context of Alzheimer disease (AD)-related proteotoxicity. 
 The specific aims of the core are: 1) to provide an imaging resource customized for the study of proteostasis 
in aging that will assist the PP investigators in the experimental preparation related to: basic microscopy 
techniques (wide-field microscopy, confocal microscopy, live cell imaging - at Mount Sinai/Einstein) and electron 
microscopy (at Einstein); 2) to provide a state-of-the art in vivo imaging platform based on two-photon microscopy 
(Innovation Unit - Mount Sinai) for dynamic analysis of changes in autophagy in brain and peripheral tissues in 
physiological aging and in disease; 3) to implement clearing imaging techniques and light-sheet microscopy for 
volume imaging to study autophagy in whole organs (Innovation Unit); 4) to develop STED superresolution 
imaging methods to study the dynamics of autophagy at the organelle level by nanoscale imaging (Innovation 
Unit). 
 Components: 1) The Imaging unit provides advice on sample preparation/processing, techniques and 
procedures for imaging in vivo and fixed samples. Performs electron microscopy (at Einstein) and specialized 
imaging procedures (at Mount Sinai) such as intravital microscopy, light-sheet imaging, STED superresolution 
and assists with imaging data interpretation; 2) The innovation unit (at Mount Sinai) will develop and implement 
procedures specific for analysis of autophagy at the tissue level (light-sheet imaging, intravital microscopy) and 
at the single molecule level (superresolution imaging) in aging and AD. 
 Services: The core will continue offering i) assistance with regular wide-field microscopy, real-time live cell 
imaging, confocal and electron microscopy, ii) distributing common reagents (antibodies, probes and 
fluorescence dyes), iii) sharing detailed protocols for image-based procedures and iv) compiling the image- 
based information for the PP data base. In addition, during this period the core has now incorporated: i) high- 
resolution imaging procedures such as intravital two-photon microscopy, superresolution STED imaging and 
light-sheet microscopy for volume imaging, ii) assistance with sample preparation for these procedures (in vivo 
mouse preparation, clearing methods) and iii) access to new image analysis software (IMARIS, ARIVIS, 
Huygens) available at the Microscopy CoRE at Mount Sinai. 
Relevance: The new technology incorporated in the core now allows dynamic and molecular resolution imaging 
to study aging and AD-related changes in autophagy at the subcellular level. This information is essential for 
future implementation of therapeutic approaches aiming at reverting these changes. The centralization of these 
new procedures optimizes cost efficiency and guarantees standardization and integration of the different groups."
10799682,"Summary A pro-inflammatory signature accompanied by changes in cellular proteostasis are observed in
brain neurodegenerative conditions such as AD and to less extent in the aging brain. However, despite the
great advancement towards the understanding of the connection between inflammation, AD development and
aging-related pathologies, there are several important aspects, which are still very much under investigated.
For example albeit it is appreciate the existence of the lymphatic system, as a brain-to-periphery
communication conduit, it is still unknown the role played by the lymph in the inflammatory/degenerative
process occurring in the brain parenchyma and in transporting the brain molecular signature to the cervical
nodes for immune-surveillance. Another important aspect, yet to be investigated, are the very early changes in
endosomal proteostasis and the proteome post-translational modifications, occurring before bona fide AD and
aging degenerative changes are observed. Finally, despite the fact that active and passive immunotherapy has
been proposed for AD the role of MHCII-restricted immune response to naturally processed TAU, Aβ and other
brain self-antigens is still unknown. As such the trust of this application is to: (i) explore the role played by the
lymphatic circulation in transporting the inflammatory/degenerative molecular signature of the brain
parenchyma to the draining cervical node (with P1 and Core B) (ii) map the very early changes in the brain
proteome, PTM- modifications, endo-lysosomal proteostasis and autophagic machinery (with P1 and Core C)
(iii) analyze changes in the MHC II-restricted immune-peptidome, and related T cell responses, during aging
and the different phases of AD progression (with P3 and Core B). By using state-of the art quantitative
proteomic, associated with a cell biology approach, we will map proteins PTMs at different stages of the aging
process and AD development as well as their effect on endo-lysosomal proteostasis and the autophagic
machinery. Additionally we will investigate the lymph inflammatory/degenerative signature in young and old
mice, as well as, AD mice at different stage of disease. Finally, the MHC II-immunopeptidome, eluted from
dendritic cells in the cervical node, will be analyzed by MS/MS to map peptides derived from brain-relevant
proteins in aging and at different stages of AD. Tetramer staining, using relevant MHC-II-peptides, will be
employed to analyze T cell recognition and address the overall immune responses to brain antigens.
Altogether results from this project will provide a progressive snap shot of how the cellular proteome is
modified during the early-to-late stages of AD or aging development, how the autophagic machinery is involved
in disposing the modified proteome, how these early changes progressively develop into complex aggregates
and how the endo-lysosomal system is involved in restoring proteostasis. Additionally, how the lymphatic
system function as a conduit to transport the inflammatory/degenerative phenotype associated with AD
development to the immune system and conversely how immune cells respond to proteomic changes in aging
and during AD progression."
10914773,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Depression is a prevalent condition that disproportionately afflicts women, including up to 20% of women during
pregnancy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) used to treat antenatal depression in pregnant
women vary greatly in their efficacy across individuals, and there are concerns that maternal SSRI treatment
detrimentally affects fetal development to elevate risk for adverse obstetric outcomes and neurodevelopmental
abnormalities in the offspring. Research is needed to identify the factors that regulate the efficacy of SSRIs and
that modify maternal-fetal responses to SSRI treatment during pregnancy. Understanding the variables that
regulate the effects of SSRIs is paramount to identifying safer and more efficacious treatments for depression in
pregnant women and to limiting harmful effects of maternal SSRI treatment on developing offspring. The gut
microbiome is emerging as one such factor that interacts directly and indirectly with SSRIs. We recently
discovered that SSRI treatment during pregnancy alters the composition of the maternal gut microbiome, and
that depletion of the maternal gut microbiome modifies fetal brain responses to maternal SSRI treatment. We
further determined that the SSRI-associated gut bacterium Turicibacter sanguinis binds SSRIs through a
previously uncharacterized protein orthologue of the mammalian serotonin transporter. This evidence raises the
important question of how the gut microbiome impacts maternal and fetal responses to SSRI treatment for
antenatal depression. To address this, we will define the impact of SSRI treatment on the function of the maternal
gut microbiome in pregnant mice, in pregnant women, and in the SSRI-binding bacterium T. sanguinis (Aim 1).
We will further test the hypothesis that variations in the maternal gut microbiome modify the pharmacokinetics
of SSRI absorption and distribution across the maternal-fetal interface (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine effects
of the maternal gut microbiome on the efficacy of SSRI treatment against symptoms of antenatal depression
(Aim 3). We will additionally assess how the maternal gut microbiome impacts the detrimental effects of maternal
SSRI treatment on neurodevelopment and behavior of the offspring. Findings from our study will reveal
fundamental mechanisms for microbial interactions with SSRIs, with the potential to transform interventional
strategies for treating symptoms of antenatal depression, while limiting adverse consequences of SSRIs on
developing offspring."

Mapping the Glucuronidome. One of the most important mammalian detoxification (inactivation) methods is the
chemical addition of glucuronic acid to biologically active compounds, glucuronidation. The rate of
glucuronidation is altered by dietary compounds and the successful elimination of glucuronidated chemicals is
inhibited by microbial removal of the glucuronic acid moiety, regenerating the active, and often toxic, compound.
Changes in the pool of glucuronides have important implications for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of
chronic diseases. Recent research efforts have focused on the role of microbiome manipulation on drug
metabolism, specifically the inhibition of microbial β-glucuronidase enzymes for reducing adverse drug reactions
to NSAIDs and chemotherapies and improving pharmaceutical treatment efficacy. Comprehensive research of
the physiologic implications of host-metabolite-microbe interactions is possible due to recent advances in mass
spectrometry methods for identifying and quantifying metabolites in complex mixtures (blood, urine, and feces)
and high-throughput -omics techniques for functional analysis of the microbiome. This proposed research aims
to develop an integrative multi-omics pipeline incorporating novel metabolomic methods, metagenomic
sequencing, and molecular biology techniques to define the physiologic effects of host-glucuronide-microbiome
interactions. The training will provide for a collaborative effort between xenobiotic metabolism, mass
spectrometry, and microbiome experts to experimentally disrupt glucuronidation, map glucuronide exchange
dynamics, and quantify resultant host metabolic signaling. The research will provide for the development of a
much needed, first-of-its-kind, comprehensive, and publicly available database of glucuronidation, facilitating the
incorporation of powerful metabolomics methods to research advancing the understanding of xenobiotic
metabolism. The proposed research will inform the current understanding of host-microbiome interaction effects
on xenobiotic metabolism and host health, with important implications for the development of individualized
medicine and microbe-targeted therapies."
10788433,"Loss of cell polarity and invasive behavior are hallmarks of cancer, but how cell polarity is preserved
during tissue growth and turnover is poorly understood. Polarity refers to the asymmetric partitioning of
membrane components and subcellular structures, is oriented along both apicobasal and planar axes,
and is essential for the proper assembly and function of epithelial tissues. The preservation of cell polarity
is of crucial importance in tumor suppression and therefore, special mechanisms must exist to preserve
polarity when cells divide. We have shown that to preserve tissue architecture, epithelial polarity is
dynamically remodeled when cells divide. Asymmetrically localized polarity proteins are temporarily
removed from the cell surface via bulk endocytosis into the cytoplasm. After division, they are recycled
to the surface where polarity is restored. This mechanism is controlled directly by mitotic kinases, the
same machinery that controls cell cycle progression and is deregulated in cancer. Thus, cell division and
planar cell polarity are controlled by the same regulatory machinery, and may explain why, in cancer,
hyperproliferation and cellular disorder are so closely intertwined.
 In this proposal we build and expand on this foundational work to investigate how cell polarity is
restored after mitosis and how cell division facilitates the establishment of robust and aligned tissue
polarity. We will capitalize on our recent technical advancements in live and super-resolution imaging of
the skin to 1) decipher the transport mechanisms that restore polarity following mitosis and how mitotic
repolarization establishes tissue-scale polarity; 2) define the spatial cues that direct mitotic repolarization;
and 3) determine how neighboring cells coordinate mitotic removal of intercellular junctions via
transendocytosis. Successful completion of ours aims will uncover the mechanisms by which a highly
proliferative epithelium preserves tissue integrity."

Chromosomal translocations involving the MLL1 gene often drive infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MLL
fusion proteins (e.g., MLL-ENL, MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10) activate self-renewal programs in hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells, ultimately leading to transformation. The high frequency of MLL1 rearrangements in infant
leukemias suggests that neonatal progenitors are uniquely poised to transform in response to these mutations.
Indeed, we have recently shown that MLL-ENL initiates AML more efficiently in neonatal progenitors than in
adult progenitors. This raises the question of whether MLL-ENL induces key effectors of transformation more
efficiently in neonatal progenitors than in adult progenitors. We identified Ski/Dach Domain Containing 1
(Skida1) as a gene that is highly induced by MLL-ENL in neonatal, but not adult hematopoietic progenitors.
SKIDA1 is also highly expressed in human pediatric MLL1 rearranged AML. Expression is largely restricted to
leukemias with MLL1 rearrangements. To test whether Skida1 promotes leukemogenesis, we generated a
germline loss-of-function mouse allele. Skida1 deletion by itself had negligible effects on normal
hematopoiesis, consistent with the lack of expression in normal hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore,
Skida1 deletion did not affect normal HSC function. However, when we induced MLL-ENL expression in
Skida1-/- neonates, we observed near complete loss of HSCs and a severe reduction in lineage committed
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Thus, Skida1-dependence emerges as a consequence of MLL-ENL
expression. Next, we generated a conditional loss-of-function mouse allele. Skida1 conditional deletion in the
hematopoietic system did not perturb normal hematopoiesis at any age. We are currently crossing the
conditional Skida1 mouse to our MLL-ENL mouse model to test whether Skida1 promotes leukemogenesis in
the context of MLL-ENL-expressing progenitors. Thus, I hypothesize that Skida1 sustains pre-leukemic HSCs
and HPCs and promotes AML during neonatal stages of life. Aim 1 will use a Skida1 conditional knockout
mouse to interrogate how Skida1 sustains MLL-ENL-expressing HSCs and HPCs. I will also test whether
Skida1 is necessary to maintain fully transformed AML cells. Aim 2 builds upon Aim 1 by adding mechanistic
studies to identify Skida1-dependent changes in gene expression and cell fate. I will test whether SKIDA1
binds chromatin to regulate leukemogenesis, and I will identify SKIDA1 binding partners. The aims of this
proposal will evaluate SKIDA1 as a potential link between age-specific transcriptional programs and AML
initiation, as well as offer a novel therapeutic vulnerability for treating infant leukemia."

Addiction is a physiological process that involves changes in neural plasticity in response to drugs of abuse.
Although genetic factors have been recognized as a strong influence on the susceptibility to addition,
environmental stimuli and life experiences also form important risk factors. There has been increasing
evidence that epigenetic mechanisms mediate the influence of environmental factors on gene activities in the
CNS and therefore are likely involved in brain development and pathology of drug abuse. Furthermore, DNA
sequence variation is known to impact epigenetic landscape, chromatin structures and molecular phenotypes
via influencing the cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. In this project, we are interested
in probing how epigenomic mechanisms mediate environmental factors such as adolescent drug exposure
during addiction development and how a genetic variant affects such mediation. We will use the state-of-the-art
omic and bioinformatic technologies to decipher the links among genetics, epigenetics and environmental
factors involved in opioid addiction. The low-input approaches will allow us to characterize epigenomic and
transcriptomic dynamics with cell-type and brain-region specificity."

 In the United States, several hundred thousand people experience cardiac arrest each year, with the vast
majority dying from this condition. Approximately two-thirds of cardiac arrest victims have previously suffered a
myocardial infarction (MI), and death results from maladaptive responses to infarct healing. The healed infarct
scar creates a substrate that supports malignant ventricular arrhythmias, and death results from ventricular
tachycardia (VT) originating in the border zone around the infarct scar. The prevailing paradigm focused on
the role of surviving ribbons of myocardial tissue traversing the borderzone region and impaired electrical
conduction as components of the arrhythmia mechanism. A problem with ascribing causation of VT entirely to
those electrical conduction factors is that they occur diffusely throughout the borderzone, but VT exists in
discrete circuits. We recently reported that the potassium channel beta subunits KCNE3 and KCNE4 are
upregulated only in VT circuits, and that these proteins cause a pattern of repolarization heterogeneity that
supports reentrant VT. We have also shown that gene transfer of either repolarization prolonging or conduction
enhancing transgenes reduces or eliminates VT inducibility. We previously developed an epicardial gene
painting method for transmural atrial gene transfer, and we have preliminary data showing that use of
epicardial gene painting with adeno-associated virus vectors allows complete transmural ventricular gene
transfer. In this proposal, we exploit these findings to develop a cure for post-infarct VT. We hypothesize that
the VT circuit-specific repolarization effects combine with the more broadly present alterations in conduction to
create an environment conducive for reentry VT, and that normalizing repolarization and/or conduction will
prevent VT. To test our hypothesis, we will focus on 3 aims: (1) to homogenize repolarization in healed MI
scar; (2) to normalize conduction velocity and cellular connectivity by increasing intercalated disk expression of
connexin43; (3) to evaluate safety and biodistribution of the proposed interventions. Successful completion of
these aims will create a preclinical data package required to support future clinical testing of VT gene therapy."
10761710,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is the most common craniofacial birth defect in humans. During
embryogenesis, the medial, lateral, and maxillary prominences of the midface must fuse at a site called the λ
junction to form the upper lip and primary palate. Previously, our lab discovered roles of the midface epithelium
during fusion, including: 1) the coordination of epithelial dissolution via two discreet cell populations undergoing
apoptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; 2) in murine models of CL/P deficient in PBX genes these
epithelial subpopulations are absent; and 3) only half of the epithelial cells removed were accounted for by
these processes. This led our lab to investigate further the presence of novel subpopulations in the midface
epithelium. In performing single cell RNA sequencing of mouse midface epithelium alone, during fusion stages,
several subpopulations were identified and validated in vivo. I found that one subpopulation possessed a
unique transcriptomic signature wherein enrichment for cell cycle arrest genes and depletion of cell cycle
progression gene transcripts coincided with the expression of genes implicated in mouse and human CL/P
pathogenesis. My in vivo analysis found this subpopulation of cells was spatio-temporally localized to the site
of λ fusion, leading us to name these cells “λ fusion effectors.” I hypothesize that the λ fusion effectors are
implicated in the pathogenesis of CL/P and that cell cycle arrest is a yet uncharacterized mechanism
tied to prominence fusion. To better understand this epithelial subpopulation and the role that the cell cycle
plays during midface fusion, I propose to 1: Assess and track cell cycle progression and arrest in λ fusion
effector cells during upper lip/primary palate morphogenesis and fusion in wild type conditions. I will
assess subpopulation dynamics in vivo by conducting EdU/BrdU dual labeling of mouse embryos and I will
track cell cycle phase changes ex vivo by using an explant system from FUCCI mouse embryos. 2: Establish
the molecular mechanisms underlying cell cycle arrest in λ fusion effector cells during upper
lip/primary palate morphogenesis and fusion in wild type conditions. I will isolate and quantify λ fusion
effector cells from the distal prominence tips using cytometry approaches and will identify PBX1 gene targets,
with a focus on cell cycle arrest genes, in the isolated subpopulation of λ fusion effector cells versus
neighboring λ epithelium. Aim 3: Determine if, in our mouse model of CL/P, embryos with compound loss
of Pbx1/2 exhibit changes to cell cycle arrest in the epithelial λ fusion effector subpopulation. I will
quantify and assess perturbations in the λ fusion effector cell subpopulation in Pbx1/2 mutants with CL/P. My
research will investigate the molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest during fusion of the λ junction and how it
pertains to CL/P pathogenesis. Given the genetic links of this subpopulation to human CL/P, it is my hope that
this study will provide novel targets for CL/P early prenatal diagnosis, prevention and treatment, and uncover
mechanisms of cell cycle arrest with broad implications in tissue fusion, repair and morphogenesis."

The human placenta is a semi-allogeneic tissue whose growth and development requires tolerance by the
maternal immune system. How this relationship is compromised in the setting of spontaneous preterm birth
(sPTB) is currently unknown. In a normal pregnancy, placental cells come in close contact with maternal blood
and uterine tissues yet are able to evade immune recognition throughout gestation. During this time, the maternal
immune system maintains a balance of tolerance toward foreign fetal alloantigens while simultaneously staging
a response to potential pathogens at the maternal-fetal interface. The nature of such maternal-fetal cellular
interactions is poorly understood, particularly when it goes awry in the setting of spontaneous preterm birth
(sPTB). The uterine lining, called decidua, is a particularly understudied microenvironment, containing many
maternal immune cells, of which decidual natural killer (dNK) cells are the most abundant. It is at this interface
where placental cells called extravillous trophoblast (EVT) come in close contact with maternal immune cells.
Invasion of the decidua by fetal EVT is required for proper remodeling of the maternal uterine lining, including
vascular remodeling which leads to establishment of maternal blood flow to the placenta. Interactions between
placental EVT and decidual leukocytes, such as dNK, are known to facilitate maternal vascular remodeling by
EVT and limit the extent of EVT invasion into the uterine wall. Indeed, problems in sPTB could result from
inappropriate responses by dNK cells. Unfortunately, dNK function, including dNK-trophoblast crosstalk, is
difficult to study in an ongoing pregnancy, due to lack of access to the decidual compartment, where these
important interactions occur. Additionally, very few studies have characterized dNK at term when the pregnancy
outcome is known. While animal models have offered some insights into these processes, they do not accurately
model human placentation and pregnancy. This proposal aims to functionally and transcriptomically characterize
dNK subpopulation(s) in term, with or without labor, and preterm placenta, then use induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSC) to model dNK, in the setting of both term and preterm birth. Our team has established optimized
methods for differentiation of iPSC into both peripheral blood NK cells and EVT. We will now optimize a protocol
for iPSC differentiation into decidual NK cells, comparing them directly to primary cells. Successful completion
of this proposal will reveal underlying mechanisms through which abnormal dNK activation contributes
to spontaneous preterm birth, and establish a renewable and manipulatable model of dNK at the human
maternal-fetal interface."

Sex hormones and sex chromosome genes instruct development of sex-specific features during
neurodevelopment, including differences in somatic gene expression and gray matter volume. Together, these
developmental programs lead to fundamental differences at the molecular, cellular, and tissue level between
males and females. While some neurological disorders have clear links to X chromosome genes, such as Rett
Syndrome and Fragile X Syndrome, other disorders including Autism show sex-biased penetrance with no
clear genetic mechanism. This proposal aims to address the mechanistic basis of sex-dimorphic transcriptional
responses to retinoic acid signaling in the developing brain. Retinoic acid signaling is indispensable for
modulating gene regulatory programs that orchestrate proper nervous system development, and recent work
has shown that the Autism risk gene FOXP1 is upregulated in response to retinoic acid signaling. Preliminary
studies have shown specific upregulation of FOXP1 in response to retinoic acid signaling in female cortical
organoids, and not in males. This project will similarly leverage stem cell-derived cortical organoids to model
neurodevelopment in vitro to better understand the molecular basis of sex-dimorphic phenotypes upon
exposure to retinoic acid. Aim 1 will characterize sex-dimorphic genome wide expression changes in response
to retinoic acid. Male and female organoids will be treated with vitamin A, the precursor to retinoic acid, and
used for scRNA-seq. This dataset will uncover genes upregulated specifically in female organoids in response
to retinoic acid. Additionally, I will identify cell types in both male and female organoids that exhibit the greatest
gene expression changes in response to retinoic acid, lending insight into cell type-specific sensitives to
retinoic acid during neurodevelopment. In Aim 2, the relationship between dosage of X-linked lysine
demethylase KDM5C and retinoic acid-induced sex-specific gene regulatory programs will be characterized.
Knockdown of KDM5C in female stem cell-derived organoids and subsequent genome-wide changes in H3K4
methylation, which is demethylated by KDM5C, will be determined by CUT&Tag. A putative enhancer at the
FOXP1 locus coincides with H3K4me3 marks, and KDM5C-dependent methylation at this genomic site will be
of particular importance. The impact of KDM5C knockdown on retinoic acid-induced FOXP1 expression will
then be interrogated by immunohistochemistry. Together, these experiments will further our understanding of
the intersection of epigenetics, gene expression, and cell signaling pathways during neurodevelopment,
providing an an important mechanistic basis for sex-dimorphic developmental programs. This will further our
understanding of the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders with sex-biased penetrance, while uncovering
potential candidates for therapeutic interventions."

HIV infects the brain soon after transmission, but it is unknown how infected brain cells contribute to HIV
persistence and whether these cells release viable virus that can seed cells outside the brain. It is also unclear
how HIV persistence leads to local cellular damage, although inflammatory and external factors (like antiretroviral
[ARV] penetration and opioids) likely impact such damage. Such new knowledge could be important for HIV cure
strategies and ways to improve brain health in persons with HIV (PWH).
This project will address stated objectives of RFA-MH-20-701, Role of Myeloid Cells in Persistence and
Eradication of HIV-1 Reservoirs from the Brain, by: (i) mapping HIV reservoir size, composition, and activity in
brain myeloid cells (BMC) in relation to cellular density and levels of ARV and opioids, (ii) determining the role
of BMC in HIV dispersal within the central nervous system (CNS) and across the body in the setting of ARV
treatment (ART) and after treatment interruption, and (iii) defining how HIV reservoir size and activity in BMC is
associated with local inflammation and cell damage.
Our goal is to examine the role of BMC in HIV persistence, local inflammatory-induced damage and as a source
of viruses that can egress from the CNS to re-seed peripheral organs.
The rationale for this project is supported by literature demonstrating that brain macrophages and microglia can
harbor HIV that persists during modern ART. The low turnover of these macrophages and microglial cells (from
months to years) make them unique reservoirs for HIV. While HIV in resting T cells has been extensively
characterized, the role of BMC as a source of rebound upon cessation of ART is yet to be determined. Further,
HIV in BMC likely triggers immune responses, even during ART, causing local damage.
Our overall hypothesis is that BMC (primarily microglial cells) contribute to HIV persistence in the CNS with
regional heterogeneity. HIV harbored in these BMC likely also causes inflammation-associated brain damage
and contributes to viral dispersal when ART is stopped. We also hypothesize that HIV persistence, local damage
and viral dispersal are influenced by local ARV and opioid levels.
To address these open questions, our study will collect and analyze tissues throughout the CNS (white and grey
matters of frontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, cerebellum, spinal cord), ileum, spleen, blood
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of altruistic PWH enrolled in the Last Gift cohort, an ongoing rapid autopsy study.
Some participants (n=15) will remain virally suppressed until the time of death, while others (n=5) will want to
stop their ART before death. Half of the population will use prescription opioids.
These studies will be important for PWH because they will provide new insights for the development of strategies
to clear HIV infection and lessen inflammatory-dependent microglial-induced neurological damage."
10818603,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Families are facing significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those caring for a child with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A recent SPARK survey1 (N = 8,000) found that approximately 95% of parents
reported increases in their child’s challenging behaviors as a result of COVID-19, and the restricted, repetitive
behaviors and interests (RRBI) of children likely fall within this category. Since only 35% of parents who took the
SPARK survey indicated their child is receiving therapy services remotely, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely
exacerbate this core symptom of ASD. RRBIs are often the target for clinical treatment, as they can significantly
interfere with learning, and are associated with long-term functional impairment, and psychiatric comorbidities
(e.g., anxiety). Given children with ASD are currently out of routine and experiencing a severe reduction in
therapeutic and educational services, the RRBIs and comorbidities of children are likely magnified at this time.
Yet, there are no effective therapies to treat the full range of repetitive, inflexible behaviors found in ASD, and
there have been no large-scale studies of behavioral interventions specifically developed to target this core
symptom domain. This has resulted in a significant treatment gap between the number of effective behavioral
therapies used to target atypical social-communication behaviors in autism when compared to those designed
to treat repetitive behaviors. Thus, our team developed and pilot-tested the Family-Implemented Treatment for
Behavioral Inflexibility (FITBI), derived from neurobehavioral models of reward and learning. The overall goal of
FITBI is to teach parents how to identify high probability cues in the environment that can elicit RRBI symptoms
and teach their child to inhibit repetitive behaviors and instead replace them with flexible and more functional
behaviors. Since our initial pilot studies, the need for technology-based interventions has certainly increased.
While the effectiveness of telehealth interventions for children with ASD is emerging, early research suggests
interventions delivered via telehealth for children with ASD may be just as effective as in-person interventions.
Yet, we currently have no understanding of the effectiveness of RRBI interventions delivered remotely.
Therefore, the overall goal of this project is to conduct a parallel group randomized controlled trial (RCT)
comparing remote delivery of FITBI (12-week intervention + 3 booster sessions over 6 months) to remote delivery
of a parent education only (PE) control condition in a final sample size of 100 (3-9 years) children with ASD and
high rates of ritualistic repetitive behaviors. We will use TORSH, a comprehensive secure online platform that
enhances therapist-parent coaching via telehealth. Further, an important objective of this proposal is to examine
child and parent factors associated with treatment response and uptake in order to advance translational
research and knowledge on personalized intervention approaches."
10836455,"The goals of this study are to understand how inhibiting DNA-PK activity 1) induces and increases tumor
antigen/neoantigen expression in weakly immunogenic tumors and 2) contributes to maintaining dendritic cells
and myeloid cells in a T cell-activating state. These goals are motivated by exciting clinical results which
demonstrate that T cell-based immunotherapies can mediate tumor regression but also because durable
responses to current therapies are observed in only a subset of patients and against a limited number of
cancers. Favorable responses to immunotherapies correlate with levels of neoantigens and changes in the
tumor-reactive TCR repertory. Cancers can evade T cell detection by downregulating major histocompatibility
complex (MHC I) and antigen expression. We screened ~2,500 compounds for the ability to selectively
regulate the expression of various tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) and increase MHC I expression. Among
the most effective drugs were DNA-PK inhibitors. Our preliminary studies indicate that DNA-PK inhibition
increases and diversifies the expression of various TAAs and neoantigens in melanoma at the transcriptional
level leading to increased protein expression. Further, reduced DNA-PK levels or DNA-PK mutations in patient
samples are associated with increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and tumor mutation burden. The
overarching hypothesis is that DNA-PK plays a novel role as a transcriptional regulator that modifies the
expression of melanoma tumor antigens, including neoantigens, and thereby increases the diversity,
frequency, and activity of tumor-reactive T cells. We further postulate that inhibiting DNA-PK activity in DCs
and myeloid cells reduces their propensity to enter a T cell-suppressive state. These hypotheses will be
addressed through the following aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which DNA-
PKcs regulates tumor antigen expression by determining the role of kinase activity, identifying the DNA-PK
substrate(s) that contribute to its repressive function, and to define the roles that the individual DNA-PK
subunits play in transcriptional regulation. Aim 2 will ascertain the in vivo impact that DNA-PK inhibition has on
increasing and diversifying the tumor-reactive T cell repertoire. We seek to demonstrate that DNA-PK inhibition
treatment increases the number and activity of neoantigen-reactive T cells. Aim 3 will determine the impact
that inhibiting DNA-PK has on inducing and sustaining stimulatory signals on tumor derived dendritic and
myeloid cells. We will determine how DNA-PK inhibition prevents DCs and myeloid cells from a entering a T
cell-suppressive state. The proposed studies are significant as they will offer molecular and cellular insights as
to how DNA-PK activity contributes to tumor immunogenicity and exploit these insights to develop more
reliable biomarkers and effective therapies against weakly immunogenic tumors."

This proposal focuses on the activation and utilization of dioxygen by heme and nonheme transition metal centers
in metalloenzymes and in related synthetic systems. A subset of nonheme iron enzymes utilize a single iron
center to activate dioxygen and mediate the oxidation of various substrates, including sulfur substrates as seen
in thiol dioxygenases (TDOs) (e.g. cysteine dioxygenase (CDO)), persulfide dioxygenases (PDOs) (e.g.
ethylmalonic encephalopathy protein (ETHE1)), sulfoxide synthases (e.g. EgtB, OvoA), and isopenicillin N
synthase (IPNS). The related nonheme iron hydroxylases (e.g. TauD) and halogenases (e.g. SyrB2) also
activate O2 with a single iron center to transform C-H bonds into C-X (X = OH, Cl) groups. Many questions remain
regarding the mechanisms of action of these proteins, although the proposed pathways for these different
enzymes include several common iron/oxygen intermediates. Heme enzymes also activate O2 for similar
oxidative chemistry, such as C-H hydroxylation carried out by the monooxygenase cytochrome P450 (CYP), or
the C-C bond cleavage and dioxygenation of indoles carried out by tryptophan and indoleamine dioxygenase
(TDO/IDO). The proposed efforts involve the synthesis of biomimetic heme and nonheme iron complexes that
will be used to examine how the first and second coordination spheres influence O2 activation and substrate
oxidations. Efforts will be made to characterize metastable transition metal/O2 species (e.g. M-O2, M-OOH, M=O,
M-OH) that are proposed as key intermediates in heme and nonheme O2 activation. Characterization of these
species in structurally well-defined complexes will provide support for the analogous, putative intermediates in
the enzymatic systems. The feasibility of key bond-making and bond-breaking events will be established by
examining the reactivity of these metal/oxygen adducts with various substrates. Mechanistic questions will be
addressed through comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic studies. Systematic modifications will be made
to these low molecular weight complexes through established synthetic methodologies, providing atomic-level
control over their geometric/electronic structures. This approach provides a means to establish structure-function
relationships that can be challenging or impossible to obtain when studying the enzymes alone. Questions to be
addressed include what are the key intermediates during heme and nonheme iron activation of O2? What are
the key spectroscopic features of these intermediates? Which of these species are capable of oxidizing which
substrates? How does the structural and electronic properties of the ligands holding the metal center influence
the O2 activation process? What controls the selectivity of substrate oxidations? Addressing these questions
should lead to new knowledge regarding how heme and nonheme iron enzymes activate O2 and selectively
oxidize substrates. These enzymes participate in biological processes that are essential for human health and
disease, making them targets for both diagnostic and therapeutic treatments."
10832054,"Psychostimulant abuse is a public health crisis that affects millions of individuals in the United States and
results in profound economic, social, and individual harm. However, despite rapid increases in overdose
deaths linked to stimulant drugs like cocaine, there are still no approved therapeutic options for stimulant
abuse disorders. Psychostimulant drugs act through well-defined signaling mechanisms to elevate
dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key reward-linked brain structure that
integrates information from diverse brain regions to directly influence motivated behavior. Further, cocaine
causes epigenetic and transcriptional reorganization in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc, promoting
maladaptive shifts in cell signaling and synaptic function. Our preliminary data indicates that expression of Reln
mRNA, which codes for the large secreted extracellular matrix protein Reelin, is enriched in a subpopulation of
MSNs that are robustly activated by cocaine. Although Reelin knockout animals exhibit impaired response to
psychostimulants and Reelin plays a critical role in synaptic plasticity and memory formation in other brain
regions, the role of Reelin in cocaine-related cellular and behavioral adaptations has never been studied. In
this proposal, we will test the overarching hypothesis that Reelin signaling is required for the maladaptive
molecular, physiological, and behavioral effects of cocaine in the NAc. Specific Aim 1 of this proposal will
combine bidirectional CRISPR-based manipulations and single-cell RNA sequencing to determine how Reelin
signaling impacts transcriptional responses to cocaine and dopamine receptor activation. Specific Aim 2 will
use in vitro and in vivo single unit recordings and ex vivo slice electrophysiology to test the hypothesis that
Reelin regulates cocaine response by modulation of physiological and synaptic properties of MSNs. Finally,
Specific Aim 3 will use cell-specific in vivo Reelin manipulations in combination with behavioral assays of
cocaine and natural reward to test the hypothesis that Reelin enhances the behavioral effects of cocaine.
Together, these experiments will identify Reelin target genes in the NAc, dissect molecular signaling pathways
by which Reelin alters MSN function and physiology, and determine whether Reelin expression within the NAc
modulates cocaine-related behavioral plasticity. These studies will reveal fundamental mechanisms by which
Reelin contributes to psychostimulant response, and will pave the way for future experiments to explore how
this unique Reln-expressing cell population contributes to motivated behavior."

BARD1 (BRCA1-Associated RING Domain protein-1) is an essential partner of the breast and
ovarian cancer tumor-suppressor protein, BRCA1, and is included in a panel of genes used to
evaluate patients with suspected hereditary cancer predisposition, especially breast and ovarian
cancers. Despite this, little is known about the cellular role of BARD1. This project aims to
address this serious gap in knowledge by defining at a molecular level how BARD1 contributes
to DNA damage repair and to transcriptional repression. An ultimate goal is to enable
predictions regarding potential loss-of-function phenotypes for mutations identified in patients.
BRCA1 and its obligate partner BARD1 form a heterodimeric complex that is implicated in
numerous cellular processes, most notably, transcriptional regulation and DNA repair via
homologous recombination. The sole enzymatic activity directly associated with the
BRCA1/BARD1 complex is as an E3 Ubiquitin ligase. The RING domains of BRCA1 and
BARD1 specifically and uniquely target positions on the tail of nucleosomal histone H2A. The
ability of BRCA1/BARD1 to place these Ub marks is essential to both its transcriptional
repression of certain genes and its function in DNA damage repair by homologous
recombination. While the RING of BRCA1 is required for all ligase activity, breast cancer patient
mutations in the RING of BARD1 display loss-of-function specifically for ubiquitylation of H2A. A
newly determined cryo-EM structure of the BRCA1/BARD1 RING domains sitting atop a
nucleosome reveals that BARD1 dictates the orientation of the E3 ligase and, therefore,
determines the site(s) of modification on H2A. In this project, we will build on this exciting new
structural insight to address how regions outside BARD1’s RING contribute to its function as an
essential partner of BRCA1."
10846765,"Millions of Americans suffer from deficits in reward-seeking, in the context of psychiatric disorders, such as major
depressive disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. Stress can both exacerbate these disorders
and directly cause reward-seeking deficits. Mice subjected to chronic stress also develop reward-seeking
deficits. However, it remains unclear how stress disrupts reward-seeking. Reward-seeking is a complex process
that includes anticipatory motivation to obtain rewards, an assessment of the hedonic value of rewards, and
learning to associate reward-predicting cues with rewarding outcomes. Communication between the ventral
tegmental area (VTA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a central role in these processes. Dopamine (DA)
released from the VTA to the NAc supports components of reward-seeking, including anticipation and learning.
Yet efforts to show that VTA-NAc DA deficits underlie stress-induced reward-seeking deficits have yielded mixed
results. Recently, researchers have identified that inhibitory VTA GABA neurons are also key for setting
expectations that both guide reward anticipation and associative learning. We have found that during acute
stress, these VTA GABA neurons induce rhythmic NAc activity and that this activity predicts subsequent transient
reductions in reward-seeking. Moreover, rhythmically stimulating NAc projecting VTA GABA neurons suffices to
recapitulate both stress-induced NAc rhythmic activity and subsequent reward-seeking deficits. These data raise
the possibility that chronic stress causes reward-seeking deficits via VTA-NAc GABA activity. Since VTA GABA
neurons have known roles in anticipation and learning, these data also suggest that chronic stress might disrupt
encoding of specific aspects of reward-seeking. This proposal tests these ideas and directly links chronic stress-
induced VTA-NAc GABAergic activity to subsequent deficits in the encoding of reward-seeking. Specific Aim 1
will test whether two chronic stress disrupts specific aspects of reward-seeking using tasks that assess
associative learning, anticipatory motivation and hedonic valuation and consider mice along the susceptible-
resilient spectrum. Specific Aim 2 will use optogenetics and chronic in vivo multi-site electrophysiology in awake,
behaving mice to test whether VTA-NAc GABAergic activity causes chronic stress-induced reward-seeking
deficits by recording the in vivo firing activity of VTA-NAc GABA projections during chronic stress and subsequent
reward-seeking. We will also determine whether chronic optogenetic stimulation of this pathways suffices to
induce persistent reward-seeking deficits. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will use pathway-specific chemogenetic
blockade to test whether blocking VTA-NAc GABAergic activity can prevent chronic stress-induced reward-
seeking deficits. We will also use Cal-Light (calcium and light-activated gene expression) to express an inhibitory
opsin in stress-activated VTA neurons. This technique will allow us to test whether inhibiting stress-activated
neurons during reward-seeking can reverse the effects of chronic stress. With this approach, we will develop
pathway and cell-type specific understanding of how chronic impairs reward-seeking with the goal of finding
novel treatments for reward-seeking deficits."

peptides, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles, mostly composed by hyperphosphorylated
tau. The impacts of AD on patients, families, caregivers and society are shattering. Regrettably,
AD-modifying drugs are unavailable underscoring the scant understanding of AD pathogenesis.
~5% of AD cases have early onset (<65 yo) and are due to Familial autosomal dominant
mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 (FAD); ~95% of cases are sporadic with late onset (>65
yo, SAD). Yet, commonly used animal organisms model FAD. This may be an issue if FAD and
SAD present significant pathogenic differences. If so, therapeutics effective in FAD animals may
have limited efficacy in SAD patients. Thus, models that reproduce the pathogenesis of SAD are
needed to identify therapeutic targets and test SAD-modifying therapeutics. Variants of the
microglia gene TREM2 increase the risk of SAD by 3 fold. To gain insights into the pathogenic
mechanisms of SAD, we generated rats carrying the p.R47H pathogenic variant in the rat
Trem2 gene (Trem2R47H). Rat and human APP differ by 3 amino acids in the Aβ region. These
differences may be crucial in this model organism because: 1) human Aβ possesses higher
propensity to form toxic species as compared to rodent Aβ; 2) the pathogenic role of the p.R47H
TREM2 variant may be linked to deficits in microglia-mediated human Aβ clearance. To
overcome this issue, we humanized the rat Aβ sequence (Apph allele); thus, our rat models
produce human Aβ from the endogenous rat App gene. We choose a knock in (KI) approach
rather than the more common transgenic overexpression approach because KI models make no
preconceived assumption about pathogenic mechanisms, except the unbiased genetic one. In
contrast, transgenic models, which produce high levels of Ab and can readily deposit amyloid
plaques, are based on the hypothesis that plaques and/or other forms of toxic Ab have a central
pathogenic role. We propose to dissect pathogenic mechanisms triggered by the p.R47H
pathogenic variant using these KI rat models. We will also study the impact of Trem2R47H on the
pathological processes triggered by the Apps and Psen1LF FAD mutations. We will analyze
microglia function, cell-to-cell transcriptomic changes in the brain, APP processing, brain
pathology, neuro-inflammation and neurodegeneration, synaptic transmission/plasticity, learning
& memory. Dissecting pathogenic pathways set off by the Trem2R47H variant may pave the way
to therapeutic approaches that can prevent/delay sporadic AD."
10818348,"Project Summary
Overcoming the poor efficacy of tumor cell vaccines will require enhancing activation of the immune system and
preventing an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment such as local hypoxia. In this proposal, we will
address this critical need by engineering tumor cell vaccines with advanced oxygen-releasing biomaterials (O2-
cryogels) to combat hypoxia-driven immunosuppression and improve antitumor immune responses in relevant
mouse models of prostate cancer. Our preliminary data in mice indicate that: (i) O2-cryogels can reverse local
hypoxia and restore the function of key immune cells (dendritic cells; DCs); (ii) once in the body, cryogel vaccines
efficiently localize transplanted tumor cells, controllably release immunomodulatory factors, and recruit large
numbers of DCs from the host; and (iii) elicit a specific and robust vaccine-induced T cell-mediated antitumor
immunity. Here, we will optimize the characteristics of O2-cryogels for maximum antitumor efficacy and safety;
and assess their ability to suppress the local hypoxic stress and improve DC recruitment, activation, and homing
to the draining lymph nodes. Finally, we will test O2-cryogel vaccines in prophylactic and therapeutic mouse
models of prostate cancer to determine their ability to induce specific, effective, and long-lasting antitumor
immune responses. This proposal may have a sustained impact on the field by defining a new avenue of cancer
immunotherapy that operates independently but synergizes with other therapies."
10836377,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Infertility affects up to 13% of childless couples yet the biological mechanisms underlying infertility and the effects
of infertility on overall health remains poorly understood. The goal of Project 1 within The Massachusetts General
Hospital Harvard Center for Reproductive Medicine will be to apply human genomics, transcriptomics and
phenomics to understand the mechanistic biological drivers of rare disorders of human infertility. A pervasive
methodologic theme of 'omics’ technologies runs through Project 1’s three specific aims. In Aim 1, infertility will
be viewed through the prism of rare hypogonadotropic and hypergonadotropic conditions that cause infertility.
Clinical investigators will apply contemporary genomic techniques to define the underlying genetic architecture
of infertility and to identify master regulatory pathways and networks that determine fertility. Three unique clinical
cohorts will be utilized to achieve this aim: US-based admixed cohorts of patients with idiopathic
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH)/Kallmann Syndrome [Massachusetts General Hospital] and primary
ovarian insufficiency [University of Utah]; and, a Saudi Arabia-based consanguineous cohort of patients with a
spectrum of rare Mendelian forms of infertility. The full spectrum of genetic variation (coding and non-coding
single nucleotide variants, insertion/deletion variants and structural variants) that confer substantial relative risk
for infertility will be determined and causal genes identified will be coalesced into common, final pathways
elucidating the predominant drivers of rare forms of infertility. In Aim 2, genetic variants identified from Aim 1 and
variants identified in Project 2 of the Center that relate to hypothalamic-hypogonadotropic forms of infertility will
be validated in CRISPR-engineered GnRH neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells generated by
the Genomics & Functional Core of the Center. Specifically, the cellular and molecular consequences of genetic
variation on GnRH neurons will be defined by comparing and contrasting the GnRH transcriptome, morphology,
migratory capability and secretory function between wild-type and edited GnRH neurons. Similarly, genetic
variants relating to hypergonadotropic forms of infertility leading to primary ovarian insufficiency will be studied
in a Drosophila model system by ovary-specific RNAi knockdown (or overexpression) experiments. Finally, in
Aim 3, a hospital-based human biobank (Partners Biobank) will be utilized to perform a recall-by-genotype based
targeted phenotypic evaluation in individuals harboring pathogenic variants in infertility-associated genes. The
full reproductive phenotype (“reproductome”) will be defined using deep phenotyping studies that will define the
effects of harboring genetic risk variants on GnRH-induced pituitary LH pulse profiles and hypothalamic-pituitary
responsiveness to exogenous kisspeptin administration. Through these coordinated studies, this project will aid
in the diagnosis and management of infertility, inform genetic risk prediction for infertility conditions, and facilitate
the development of novel therapeutic options for infertility."
10809628,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The broad goal of the proposed research program is to advance our understanding of sound localization. Even
when a person has normal hearing, speech perception and learning in noisy reverberant environments may
still be compromised due to persistently impaired binaural hearing capabilities. In more profound cases of
deafness, bilateral cochlear implant users typically experience poor discrimination of interaural time differences
(ITDs), potentially because of early deprivation. This proposal uses an avian model to advance our
understanding of binaural development. We have developed this preparation to determine if/when there is a
developmental window in which inputs from each ear are synchronized, in order for sensitivity to ITDs to
develop. Sensitivity to binaural signals first appears in the brainstem and relies on sub-millisecond precision to
detect ITDs. How such extreme precision comes about during development is not fully understood, and these
birds provide a well understood model for measurement of precisely timed binaural signals. Our knowledge of
this ITD circuit is detailed enough to test the following hypotheses about the physiology and development of
sound localization circuits. In the broader context, understanding the mechanisms of sound localization should
reveal common computational solutions to guide advances in hearing aid and cochlear implant design. The
three overlapping areas to be investigated in this project are:
1. Determine if the representation of ITDs is plastic during development.
Detection of ITDs depends on precise coding of delay, with current research on how ITDs change with head
growth. We will use a unilateral conductive hearing loss (CHL) model, in which one ear canal is plugged
around the onset of hearing, to induce experience dependent plasticity during the period of head growth.
These experiments should allow us to determine if maps of ITD are modified by early experience. In Aim 1.2
we will focus on myelin plasticity as a potential mechanism for modification.
2. Address mechanisms underlying the emergence of temporal precision.
If delays can be modified by altered experience, it is likely that normal ITD coding also shows developmental
refinement. Delay lines encode time with sub-millisecond accuracy. To shed light on the mechanisms
underlying ITD map formation, we will combine recordings of the extracellular field potential with intracellular
recording from delay line axons to measure the development of ITD coding in the first 2 months posthatch.
3. The role of inhibition in the development of ITD coding.
Given the importance of inhibition in regulating auditory brainstem activity, we will examine the nature of the
inhibitory input to NL and cochlear nuclei. We will use the unilateral CHL model to induce experience
dependent plasticity in map of ITD, and test the competing hypothesis to Aim 1.2, that changes in delay are
correlated with changes in inhibition."
10825573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although the past two decades witnessed the large-scale analyses of cellular components, e.g. exomes, their
impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. For example, 6/7 drug candidates failed
safety and 3/4 failed efficacy in recent FDA clinical trials. These unsolved, but related issues, safety and efficacy,
reflect significant gaps in understanding of the triangular interrelationship between diseases, molecular function,
and drug treatments. A key conceptual limitation of contemporary drug discovery is the often implicitly assumed
single drug for a single protein target disease model. In reality, most diseases are caused by multiple
malfunctioning molecules. Whether it be disease treatment or precision medicine diagnostics, there is often an
inability to identify disease-associated mode of action (MOA) proteins. To begin to address these issues, in the
current MIRA proposal, we developed a promising protein structure and network-based Artificial Intelligence (AI)
approach, MEDICASCY, to predict disease-associated MOA proteins, drug indications, side effects and efficacy;
however, much more needs to be done. Here, we propose to build on our successes and develop an integrated
AI-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that addresses the following: The first step in determining a drug’s MOA
and off-target interactions is to identity its protein targets. This requires the structures of all human proteins and
their complexes. While we predicted suitable models for at least one domain in 97% of human proteins, using
deep learning, we will predict the structures of the missing domains, domain-domain orientations and protein-
protein complexes. We will extend small molecule virtual ligand screening (VLS) to predict binding affinities
based on the insight that interacting ring-protein subpocket geometries and chemistry are conserved across
protein families, are often privileged chemical structures and are likely low free energy complexes. Cryptic protein
pockets, recently recognized as important drug targets, will be predicted and included in our VLS approach.
Antibody-based immunotherapies are powerful but have similar safety and efficacy issues as small-molecules;
thus, their safety and efficacy will be predicted by MEDICASCY-X. While MEDICASCY works on an “averaged
human”, MEDICASCY-X will consider individual genetic and epigenetic profiles to make it a true precision
medicine tool. We will predict which MOA proteins should be targeted and if a protein’s MOA is due to a loss or
gain of function. The same framework will predict synergistic drug-drug interactions. Another way to prioritize
MOA proteins is by disease comorbidity: proteins occurring in multiple diseases are likely important. If disease
comorbidity can be predicted, we will construct the “Phylogenetic” Tree(s) of Diseases that would facilitate a
deeper understanding of disease interrelationships. As proof of principle of the effectiveness of the algorithms
being developed, novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases will be developed. Thus, this
project could enhance the success rates of drug discovery and precision medicine while reducing time and cost."

 American Indians and Alaska Native (AIAN) people are disproportionately affected by chronic pain 
conditions, including arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, and lower back pain. AIAN communities have also 
experienced harm as a result of pain solutions offered by Western medicine, such as prescription opioids, which 
have contributed to increased opioid misuse and mortality in AIAN people. Many AIAN people have turned to 
Native medicine and other non-Western approaches to pain management. Thirty-four states have legalized 
marijuana for medical use, while 12 states, and the District of Columbia, have legalized non-medical use, and 
cannabidiol (CBD) derived from hemp is no longer a controlled substance. Therefore, cannabis products are 
available to the majority of U.S. adults. 66% of adults think that cannabis provides pain relief, and 42% of 
medicinal marijuana users report using it to relieve pain. While initial evidence indicates that cannabis 
tetrahydrocannabinol [THC] has analgesic effects, the evidence for cannabis-associated reductions in pain 
intensity and interference (i.e., the extent to which pain interferes with functioning) is limited. There is very limited 
data about the effects of how a variety of cannabis products available on the legal market (e.g., different strains, 
methods of delivery) and patterns of use impact pain outcomes and the comorbidities (e.g., mental health, sleep) 
that are associated with pain. As a sovereign nation in Washington State, our Tribal partners developed the 
Qwibil Clinic, which advises patients on the use of cannabis for the management of pain and other medical 
problems. The Qwibil Clinic provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between cannabis use, 
pain, and pain-related factors in an AIAN owned and operated clinic. We propose a mixed-methods embedded 
(QUANT+Qual) study to assess how cannabis impacts pain intensity and interference in a sample of n=350 
patients seeking chronic pain treatment at the Qwibil Clinic. We will identify types and patterns of cannabis use 
that are associated with pain outcomes over 12-months of care. We will also determine whether the effect of 
cannabis on pain outcomes is mediated through known pain-related factors (i.e., negative affect, sleep problems, 
self-efficacy) over time. To supplement our quantitative methods, we will use qualitative interviews to explore 
how patients seeking care for pain experience cannabis and its impact on pain, including participants who differ 
by sex, race (AIAN, Non-AIAN), and type of cannabis used. Finally, we will provide opportunities for AIAN 
students enrolled in Washington State University medical, nursing, pharmacy, and prevention science graduate 
programs and Northwest Indian College undergraduate programs to receive training and mentorship in cannabis 
and pain research at the Qwibil Clinic, including training in qualitative and quantitative data collection and 
analysis and dissemination of research results. Results will provide important information about the impact of 
legal cannabis products on chronic pain in a mostly AIAN sample, providing important information to people with 
pain, providers, and Tribal policymakers."
10891475,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Project 1
Tau accumulates in primary neurodegenerative tauopathies such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD,
also FTLD-tau) and secondary tauopathies such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Mutations and variants
in MAPT and other genetic loci promote this accumulation. By necessity, many groups focus on one
aspect of the tau metabolic pathway, such as interactions with molecular chaperones or autophagic
clearance, or a single mutation, such as P301L tau. These types of focused pursuits have generated
many insights into tau biology but have not yet led to comprehensive understanding of tau metabolism,
both normally and in disease. The \ goal of this center is to provide a comprehensive assessment of tau
metabolism, inclusive of wild-type and mutant tau, as well as including effects of other genetic
modifiers. Within the context of the proposed FTD Center without Walls, this project will address the
more upstream aspects of tau metabolism and homeostasis: from tau interactions with molecular
chaperones to achieving tau degradation. The long-term goal of this FTD Center without Walls
(CWOW) is to fully understand the metabolism of tau and how it changes with disease mutations and
variants. The overall objective of this project is to assess three nodes of tau metabolic regulation: 1)
interactions with molecular chaperones and co-chaperones, 2) effects of post-translational modifica-
tions (PTMs) on proteasomal and lysosomal targeting and 3) efficiency of tau proteolysis by individual
lysosomal proteases. This project’s central hypothesis is that molecular chaperones, proteosomal and
lysosomal targeting and lysosomal proteases are all potential nodes at which MAPT and other genetic
mutations can contribute to the aberrant tau homeostasis found in neurodegenerative diseases. The
rationale for this work is that through systematic study of how tau metabolism changes with gene
variants and disease, one can better comprehend the molecular perturbations predisposing to
tauopathy. Such understanding would provide a conceptual framework for understanding protein
metabolism in the field of neurodegeneration and could lead to better strategies to improve tau
clearance for treatment and/or prevention of FTLD-tau and AD. Aim 1: Generate a mechanistic
understanding of the consequences of tau, molecular chaperone and co-chaperone interactions. Aim 2:
Determine the functional effects of PTMs on tau targeting to the proteasome and autophagy/lysosome
systems. Aim 3: Test the functional effects of tau pathway variants on lysosomal proteolysis of tau.
Together with the other Project and Cores, this Project will assess upstream nodes in the tau metabolic
pathway. It will contribute to functional phenotyping of gene variants and their effect on tau metabolism
to aid in building the resources generated by the FTD CWOW, namely the Tau Metabolic Pathway
Database (TMDB) and the Tau Polygenic Risk Score (TPRS)."
10891480,"ABSTRACT
 Tauopathies may occur by familial mechanisms in which mutations in the MAPT gene are dominantly
inherited causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-tau) or by sporadic mechanisms in which MAPT
haplotypes are associated with increased disease risk (e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal
degeneration). MAPT mutations and risk haplotypes have been proposed to drive disease pathogenesis
through proteoforms that contain 3-microtubue binding domain repeats (3R tau), 4R tau, or both. However, the
contribution of specific tau forms (proteoforms) to tau toxicity and the mechanisms by which tauopathies occur
remains poorly understood. We hypothesize that MAPT mutations drive tau aggregation and neuronal
dysfunction by altering tau metabolism and overall proteostasis at one of several potential nodes of regulation.
In preliminary studies, we have shown that induced pluripotent stem cell derived-neurons expressing MAPT
mutations exhibit changes in tau turnover compared to isogenic, control neurons, and we observed differences
in the turnover of specific tau proteoforms in mutant neurons. Neurons expressing MAPT mutations exhibit
enlarged lysosomal structures and secondary elevation of lysosomal enzymes, markers of lysosomes that are
unable to properly degrade their contents. Correction of the mutant allele was sufficient to restore these
lysosomal defects. This suggests that altered tau kinetics may be due to defects in the endolysosomal
pathway. Thus, a unifying feature by which MAPT mutations drive tauopathy is through disrupted proteostasis.
The objective of this study is to extend our preliminary findings to define the nodes and mechanisms by which
tau proteoforms disrupt proteostasis in tauopathies. We hypothesize that specific tau proteoforms are sufficient
to destabilize proteostasis, alter tau half-life and secretion, and to result in the accumulation of tau in
vulnerable brain regions. To test this hypothesis, we will determine the extent to which MAPT mutations and
genetic modifiers disrupt tau kinetics and how impaired proteostasis impacts tau secretion. We will also
generate a systematic genetic interaction map to elucidate connections between MAPT mutations, alterations
in the tau metabolism pathway, and associated therapeutic targets. Together, this study will reveal novel
mechanisms underlying tauopathy that are driven by specific tau proteoforms and whether therapeutics
designed to block specific tau proteoforms impact pathologic events. Project 2 will work synergistically with the
Administration Core (Core A), Macromolecular Structure (Core B), Genomics and Transcriptomics Cores (Core
C) and Project 1 to address the overall hypothesis that proper tau metabolism requires the precise,
coordinated action of molecular chaperones, co-chaperones and lysosomal proteases. Tau Metabolism and
Variant database (TMVdb) and Tau Polygenic Risk Score (TPRS) generated from this project will be an
invaluable resource for the broader scientific community."

 The Sample Processing and Immunoassay REsearch SPIRE Core (Core C) serves the
RDRCC research community as a centralized resource for preparation and storage of clinically
derived samples, for conducting a range of standard and innovative assays on clinically-derived
material, and for serving as a conduit to other relevant Institutional research Cores. Over decades,
this core has facilitated, through disease-specific Centers of Excellence, the generation of large
specimen bio-repositories obtained from well-pedigreed patient cohorts. This well-established Core,
by providing biospecimen acquisition, processing, storage, and retrieval services, has become a
critical partner in enabling discovery at the translational interface, and in attracting the interest of a
growing group of researchers from inside and outside the institution. In a survey of the research
community, this Core was viewed as a major resource, broadly enabling scholarship on well-defined
patient cohorts followed prospectively, with the storage of high-quality samples. The high-quality
assay services provided by Core C have resulted in numerous peer-reviewed publications, abstracts
and investigator-initiated grant proposals. The assay capabilities in the Core play a critical role in
pathway validation in human rheumatic disease cohorts. The aims of this proposal are to sustain,
grow and evolve this vital resource. We have added high-dimensional metabolic analysis of immune
cell populations by Dr. Jonathan Powell, and assays of immune effector function. Core leaders have
established interactions to guide investigators to the necessary institutional expertise and resources
that provide single cell analysis, sequence-based assays of immune activity, and advanced data
analysis and interpretation.
 Core C will be directed by Drs. Casciola-Rosen and Darrah. Dr. Casciola-Rosen brings
decades of experience and rigor in running a highly effective and budget-stable research Core, and in
autoantibody discovery. Dr. Darrah recently assumed leadership of the Flow Core, and also brings
experience in sequence-based immune-based assays. Drs. Andrade and Gutierrez, both of whom
have many years of experience working with this Core team, will provide additional leadership. Dr.
Powell leads the high-dimensional immunometabolism analysis."

Sanaria’s mission is the licensure and marketing of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ) vaccines
against malaria that will prevent malaria infection and transmission in individuals and can be used in public
health-driven malaria control and elimination programs. The aim of this proposal is to shorten the time to
licensure and marketing of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines by funding aspects of the development program not
typically supported through Phase II or Phase IIB grants or contracts. Despite annual investments of >$3 B in
malaria control, malaria killed more people in Africa in 2020 than did COVID-19 and the 627,000 malaria-
attributable deaths were the highest since 2012. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine, recommended in 2021 by
WHO for use in young children, has limited efficacy in preventing malaria hospitalizations (21%) and severe
malaria (30%), and no reported protection against Pf infection. Thus, existing tools are inadequate, and a
highly effective vaccine is still desperately needed. The critical need is for a highly efficacious vaccine that
prevents malaria infection to support malaria elimination. Our 1st generation Sanaria® PfSPZ vaccine, based on
radiation attenuated PfSPZ, is safe and well tolerated in 5-month- to 61-year-olds in 21 clinical trials in 9
countries, 6 in Africa. It induces excellent protection against heterologous controlled human malaria infection
for at least 8 m and significant VE against intense natural Pf transmission in field trials in Africa for at least 18
m. Most recently it protected against clinical malaria in African women of child-bearing potential during two
malaria transmission seasons over 18 m without boosting. Additional clinical trials in African children and
pregnant women and Indonesian soldiers will start in Q2/3 2022 using PfSPZ Vaccine manufactured to meet
Phase 3 compliance. Most excitingly, Sanaria has developed a late-arresting, replication competent (LARC)
vaccine, PfSPZ-LARC2 that is expected to be 5-10 times more potent and less expensive than the 1st
generation vaccine. Our progress toward commercialization has been facilitated by a Commercialization
Readiness Pilot Program (CRPP). However, advice from consultants, communications with the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) and US FDA, exciting results of field trials of the vaccine, and the technological
development of PfSPZ-LARC2 have all significantly affected our program. As all of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines
utilize the same manufacturing, quality, and regulatory processes and clinical trial designs, the overall aims of
our ongoing CRP program have not changed; rather our innovations and developments have identified new
manufacturing, quality, regulatory and clinical tasks not funded in the ongoing CRPP, tasks that are required
for achieving licensure and commercialization of the most potent and cost effective PfSPZ vaccine. This CRPP
will facilitate production of the professional packages responsive to our consultants’ advice, recommendations
from the EMA and FDA, and to our technical advances. Success will significantly shorten the time until product
licensure and launch, and consequently to sales and saving many lives of those affected by malaria."

Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that can be targeted to multiple tumor antigens with exquisite
specificity by anti-tumor antibodies, resulting in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). This is
a key mechanism of action by several clinically successful monoclonal antibody (mAbs) therapies; however,
most patients exhibit or acquire resistance to this immunotherapy. ADCC by human NK cells is exclusively
mediated by CD16A (FcγRIIIA), a low affinity IgG Fc receptor. Patient data indicates that increasing the binding
affinity between CD16A and antibodies augments the clinical response to therapeutic mAbs. Therefore, we
generated a recombinant FcγR consisting of the extracellular region of CD64 (FcγRI), the only high affinity IgG
Fc receptor, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of CD16A, a potent activating receptor. NK cells
derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) engineered to express CD64/16A mediated robust ADCC.
Moreover, CD64/16A could function as a docking platform for anti-tumor mAbs, arming NK cells with
switchable and mixable tumor targeting elements. Our goal is to generate an optimized recombinant CD64
expressed by iPSC-derived NK cells (iNK cells). A compelling scientific premise is provided to support our
hypothesis that recombinant CD64 expressed by iNK cells can modulate their activation and enhance their
binding to tumor targeting mAbs and cancer cells. Our study will focus on epithelial ovarian cancer, the most
lethal gynecologic malignancy, as strategies to enhance ADCC have yet to be carefully investigated. Our
hypothesis will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determination of the in vitro and in vivo ADCC efficacy of
iNK cells expressing recombinant CD64; 2) optimization of recombinant CD64 signaling in iNK cells to enhance
ADCC and their in vivo durability; and 3) evaluation of the “off-the-shelf” use of iNK cells expressing
recombinant CD64 in a preclinical ovarian cancer model, including a high grade serous ovarian cancer patient-
derived xenograft. The impact of our study is that it investigates an innovative engineered NK cell platform to
express a novel recombinant FcγR to be used in combination with mAb therapies for universal tumor antigen
targeting. Our study involves a diverse team of experts with a track record of progressing basic research to the
clinic for cancer immunotherapy."

This K23 proposal seeks to provide an early-career clinical psychologist and neuroscientist (Dr. Alexander
Weigard) with the mentorship, training, and resources necessary to launch a career as an independent patient-
oriented investigator focused on using advanced computational methods to elucidate etiological mechanisms
of substance use disorders (SUDs) and generate meaningful predictions for patients. The candidate will work
towards this long-term goal through the completion of a research project focused on assessing whether two
advanced computational methods can facilitate the selection of features from neuroscientific data that are
relevant for the individualized prediction of SUD risk in youth. Although extant research in developmental
neuroscience has identified multiple early risk factors that are associated with development of SUD at the
group level, there is currently a dearth of large scale, replicable research in which neurocognitive data are used
to make reliable and generalizable predictions of SUD outcomes for individual youth. In the proposed project,
the candidate will combine his existing expertise in computational models of cognition with new training in
predictive informatics methods to assess whether two advanced computational approaches, a) sequential
sampling models (SSMs) of cognition and b) network neuroscience, can be used to extract features from
longitudinal neurocognitive data that enhance the prediction of youths’ SUD outcomes. The candidate will
conduct extensive analyses with two large data sets (Michigan Longitudinal Study, Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development Study) and collect pilot data with 60 young adults to accomplish the following research aims: 1)
Quantify the added benefit of SSM parameters for improving the performance of multivariate SUD
prediction models, and 2) Identify the multivariate neural signature of v, an SSM parameter with
promising links to substance use, and determine the potential of this signature for predicting a
precursor to SUD (substance use initiation in mid-adolescence) in ABCD and differentiating young
adults with SUDs in the newly-collected pilot sample. Completion of the following training objectives will
ensure that the candidate can both carry out the proposed project and establish himself as an independent
investigator who is well-equipped to conduct future projects following from this work: 1) Mastering principles
of machine learning model development and testing in longitudinal data sets, 2) building expertise in
using multivariate network neuroscience methods for feature selection and prediction, 3) increasing
clinical and epidemiological knowledge of SUD risk factors beyond neurocognition, and 4) improving
professional skills necessary to become an independent patient-oriented investigator. The proposed
K23 aims to take a crucial step towards the development of advanced computational neuroscience methods
that may ultimately inform SUD prevention efforts by identifying reliable predictors of individuals’ SUD risk, and
to set the candidate up to independently conduct leading edge research in the interest of this larger goal."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer is the most devastating human disease in the world, affecting almost everyone directly or indirectly.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive hematological cancer. One of the
most common genetic abnormalities in AML is the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation, resulting in the fusion
transcription factor AML1-ETO. Due to currently unclear reasons, t(8;21) AML patients are younger and
respond to initial induction chemotherapy better than most other AML patients. However, only 50-60% of
t(8;21) AML patients respond to initial chemotherapy and ~40% of initial responders relapse. Further treatment
options after relapse are limited and prognosis is generally poor. Therefore, we still need to understand the
unique molecular basis of t(8;21) AML to expand therapeutic options for treating and saving these patients.
Our long-term goal is to identify critical molecular pathogenic events that promote development and
maintenance of AML as potential therapeutic targets. The overall objectives of this competitive renewal
application are to elucidate the critical chromatin remodeling events that promote t(8;21) AML and to
characterize vulnerabilities of t(8;21) AML that will facilitate elimination of leukemia cells. Our central
hypothesis is that molecular alterations directly caused by expression of AML1-ETO provide unique
pathological conditions of t(8;21) AML, which can be targeted by novel therapies. To attain the overall
objectives, the following two specific aims will be pursued: 1) Analyze the combinatory effect of t(8;21) and KIT
mutations on leukemogenesis through integrative transcriptome and epigenome studies in mouse models and

Data sharing is essential to promote equity and maximize the impact of the significant investment in the BRAIN
Initiative. Data sharing plans are now required for BRAIN Initiative funding, but there is an urgent need to de-
velop specific policies and practice guidelines that address ethical challenges and stakeholder concerns. Data
sharing has been the object of study in other fields, such as genomics, but there are distinctive features of the
BRAIN Initiative that are likely to present unique challenges and raise new concerns. Our own experience and
research with investigators conducting BRAIN Initiative-funded studies of closed loop or adaptive deep brain
stimulation suggests that the practice of sharing data is inconsistent and incomplete, despite broad agreement
that it is important. Investigators raised ethical challenges with sharing human brain data, including issues re-
lated to privacy, consent, interoperability, and competing commercial and professional interests. The objective
of this proposal is to engage key stakeholders in a deliberative process to identify challenges and concerns
specific to sharing human data from BRAIN Initiative studies and generate empirically informed policy and
practice options to facilitate responsible sharing of human data within the BRAIN Initiative. In Aim 1, we will use
informational interviews and document analysis to identify BRAIN Initiative-specific data sharing challenges, as
well as relevant policy and practice considerations. In Aim 2, we will use semi-structured interviews and sur-
veys to evaluate BRAIN Initiative research participants’ attitudes, preferences, and concerns about data shar-
ing and brain privacy. In Aim 3, we will employ a modified policy Delphi process with diverse stakeholders to
prioritize challenges and generate and evaluate policy and practice options that address high-priority chal-
lenges. This contribution will be significant because it will provide critical empirical data to inform practice
guidelines and future policy development. By engaging diverse stakeholders, this project will help instill trust,
avoid inequities, and ensure success of current and future data sharing efforts within the BRAIN Initiative. This
project is innovative in its engagement with multiple diverse stakeholder groups and its use of mixed methods
incorporated into a modified policy Delphi framework. The work is feasible in our hands as demonstrated by
the productivity of this team in prior work, as well as our collective data sharing and neuroethics expertise, and
experience with empirical social science methods."

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major
contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with
approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having
evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients
at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes
severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins
in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary
physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize
the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an
advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long-
term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’
performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention.
In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical
practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a
series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it.
However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US
KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the
recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision
support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the
primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our
central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of
AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes."
10820561,"Abstract /Summary:
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a major global bacterial human pathogen, causing
~1 million deaths annually worldwide, due to pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Two strategies
are used to combat such infections. Antibiotics can often cure such infections, and vaccines are
used to reduce the circulating populations of the most dangerous serotypes. However, both
strategies are failing at an increasing rate. Antibiotic resistant strains are continually arising and
spreading globally; vaccination effectiveness is also under challenge, as serotypes not targeted
by current vaccine formulations are continually arising and rapidly replacing the targeted ones.
The cause of these failures is transfer of multiple foreign genes into the bacteria, but the
mechanisms that create the new infectious and resistant strain types are unclear. Transfer events
are of two types, named as micro- and macro-recombination events. The micro events, involving
dozens to several thousands of base pairs, are consistent with the known properties of gene
transfer by transformation in pneumococcus. However, more significant events involve transfer of
multiple blocks of tens of thousands of nucleotides, sometimes all from a single donor strain.
These macro-recombination events were difficult to reconcile completely with any known
mechanism of gene transfer - whether conjugation, transduction, or transformation. This project
would use microfluidics to create numerous small chambers (droplets) within which attacker-
target interactions can be studied and characterized for the first time at both the cellular and
molecular levels, both by identifying the participant cells and by tracing all gene exchange events
at full genome scale and 200-bp resolution.
Medical Relevance. Most pathogenic streptococci share the mechanism of gene transfer by
natural genetic transformation. Genetic transformation is an important path for genetic flexibility
in pneumococcus, where it is documented as key to vaccine escape and creation and spread of
new drug-resistance genes. Because Streptococcus pneumoniae is a model organism for the
study of DNA uptake, this work on the mechanism that transfers unexpectedly large blocks of
genes between strains or species will have broad impacts on understanding and targeting the
many similar peptide regulated gene exchange systems among Gram positive bacteria that are
often associated with the ability of these bacteria to cause disease."

The purpose of this Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide support for me to
become an independent investigator with a multidisciplinary research program in HIV at the intersection of
prescription drug use, comorbidities, and aging. In this project, I propose to leverage existing administrative
claims data from Medicare beneficiaries ≥65 years of age from 2007-2018 to determine how high-risk prescription
opioid use, e.g. high dose use (≥120 mg/day) or prolonged use (≥90 days), affects health outcomes and health
care utilization in older people living with HIV (PLWH). Building on my strong foundation in HIV epidemiology
and HIV comorbidities across the lifespan, the training from this K01 will allow me to (1) obtain proficiency in the
analysis of large-scale, longitudinal administrative claims data; (2) attain content expertise in prescription drug
utilization research and pharmacoepidemiology; and (3) develop expertise in the application of machine learning
methods. My career development plan includes specific coursework, seminars, conferences, directed readings,
and tailored mentoring from a multidisciplinary team comprised of experts in administrative claims data,
substance use epidemiology, pharmacoepidemiology, and machine learning methods. Rutgers University
provides an exceptional environment for completion of this training, with research support and infrastructure for
analyzing large, multiyear datasets (including Medicare claims) and conducting high-impact HIV research. The
proposed research is significant given that a substantial gap exists in understanding how prescription opioid use
affects a growing population of aging PLWH who commonly report chronic pain, and have multiple comorbidities,
increasing polypharmacy, and increased risk for untoward drug-drug interactions. This research is critical to
target appropriate prevention and treatment programs to optimize health outcomes for this population. To fill this
gap, specific aims are to: (1) Assess the associations between HIV infection and a) adverse health outcomes
(e.g. falls/fractures, dementia, mortality) and b) health care utilization (e.g. emergency department use, inpatient
hospitalizations, and outpatient visits) among older adults, and estimate the interaction between HIV infection
and high-risk prescription opioid use on adverse outcomes and utilization; (2) Among older PLWH, estimate
drug-drug interactions between high-risk prescription opioid use and specific antiretroviral drug classes or
sedatives (e.g. benzodiazepines) on risk of adverse health outcomes and health care utilization; and (3) Examine
the feasibility of applying existing machine learning approaches to predict adverse health outcomes and high
health care utilization among older PLWH based on patient profiles and opioid prescription patterns in a large
administrative claims database. Findings from this project will generate valuable new information and tools to
support clinical decisions and more precisely target prevention and treatment interventions to improve health for
older PLWH who are prescribed opioids, and directly inform an R01 application to study drug-drug and drug-
disease interactions between widely used prescription drugs and common comorbidities among older PLWH."

 The first complete long-acting (LA) formulation of an antiretroviral therapy (ART), injectable cabotegravir
and rilpivirine, is at the cusp of clinical approval—this is a potential game-changing development in the HIV
treatment field. LA ART regimens increase options for patients and providers to improve patient adherence and
persistence to treatment. Several subpopulations, including adolescent girls and young women (AGYW, ages
15-24), lag behind the 3rd 90-90-90 UNAIDS goal of viral suppression, including in Kenya. AGYW living with HIV
(AGYWLHIV) face unique challenges in persistence to ART, and LA ART options have the potential to help
overcome some of these challenges through greater confidentiality and reduced stigma compared to oral ART.
 Another major threat to AGYW’s health is unintended pregnancies, and AGYWLHIV also face unique
challenges in uptake and continuation rates of LA contraceptives. More recently, the use of LA contraceptives,
which include injectable and implantable methods, has gained marked momentum in Kenya, where many HIV
treatment programs have integrated contraceptive provision into routine HIV care including for AGWY.
Furthermore, AGYWLHIV are highly interested in co-delivery of ART and contraceptives. However, co-delivery
also raises potential issues, both pharmacological and behavioral, that require further investigation.
 We propose foundational pharmacokinetic (PK) and qualitative studies leading up to a hybrid type I
effectiveness-implementation trial randomizing individual AGYWLHIV to receive LA injectable
cabotegravir/rilpivirine vs. standard of care in Kenya. Our central premise is that use of LA ART will foster long-
term thinking for health, including for pregnancy prevention, and that leveraging existing LA contraceptive
delivery platform will make LA ART highly feasible. Aim 1a will determine if combined injectable
cabotegravir/rilpivirine use has any bidirectional drug-drug interactions with injectable or implantable
contraceptives. Method: Parallel group PK evaluation with repeat plasma sampling among cabotegravir/rilpivirine
users initiating injectable or implantable contraceptives vs. those not using any hormonal contraceptives (total 5
groups, n=21 per group). Aim 1b will qualitatively explore points of convergence and divergence, preferences
and values, and health systems readiness around wider-scale co-delivery of LA ART/contraceptives. Method:
20-40 serial, semi-structured, in-depth interviews with AGYW from above sentinel cohort, and 2-4 focus group
discussions with providers, policymakers, and stakeholders. Aim 2 will evaluate the impact of co-delivery of LA
ART and contraceptives among AGYWLHIV via a hybrid trial on: (a) effectiveness outcomes of HIV treatment
(viral suppression [primary outcome] and adherence/persistence) and contraception (uptake and continuation
rates), and (b) implementation outcomes of acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity. Method: Open label, clinic-
provided, mixed methods hybrid trial, randomizing AGYW 1:1 to switch to injectable cabotegravir/rilpivirine
(intervention arm) vs. to continue to their current oral ART regimen (control arm; total n=550)."

The mechanisms by which gut microbiota regulate intestinal homeostasis and the pathogenesis of inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD) remain unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that the host immune system can sense gut
bacterial metabolites in addition to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). The recognition of these
small molecules can influence the host immune response in the context of disease and inflammation in the gut
and beyond. Of particular interest are short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate,
which are solely metabolized by gut bacteria from otherwise indigestible carbohydrates, i.e., from fiber-rich diets,
and have been shown to alleviate disease in animal models of colitis and allergic asthma. Furthermore, SCFAs
are associated with reduced risk of various diseases, including IBD, and dysbiosis in IBD patients has been
associated with altered SCFA fermentative pathways. However, the mechanisms involved are still largely
unknown. The intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are the primary cell type in direct contact with stimuli from the
luminal microbiota and are critical players in microbe-host interactions. Although it has been shown that SCFA
can regulate T cell function, the majority of SCFA are absorbed by epithelial cells in the intestine. Only a small
portion of SCFA is available in the free form to directly act on T cells or other mucosal immune cells underneath
the epithelium in physiological conditions. Thus, how SCFA regulates mucosal immune cells to contribute to
intestinal homeostasis remains unclear. Our preliminary data demonstrated that SCFA has persistent effects on
T cell IL-10 production in vivo, which could mediate SCFA protection. The SCFA-induced long-lasting effect is
independent of gut microbiota. Interestingly, SCFA inhibits IEC expression of EZH2, a histone-modifying enzyme
methylating histone H3 lysine 27, and SCFA-treated IECs promote T cell IL-10 production. By employing
untargeted comparative metabolomic analyses, we identified that SCFA drives a significant shift in the levels of
IEC metabolites, which promote T cell IL-10 production, indicating a crucial role of IEC sensing SCFA in IEC-T
cell crosstalk and maintaining intestinal homeostasis. The central hypothesis of this project is that IEC sensing
of SCFA regulates T cell function through metabolic products, which leads to the preservation of intestinal
immune homeostasis and inhibition of IBD. We will test our hypothesis in this application to determine (1) how
SCFA epigenetically regulates IEC, the role of IEC EZH2 in T cell responses to microbiota, and the maintenance
of intestinal homeostasis; (2) which IEC metabolites induced by SCFA are required for promoting T cell IL-10
production and inhibition of colitis; and (3) the role of IEC metabolites in the prevention and treatment of colitis."

The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the proximal molecular drivers and mechanisms
of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to enable the development of new and better therapies
that target these processes but spare the broader immune system. This proposal will explore the
role of the Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1, or L1) in type I interferon (IFN)-positive
SLE. We have discovered that most SLE patients have high-titer autoantibodies against the first
protein encoded by L1, ORF1p and that the titers of these autoantibodies correlate with disease
activity as measured by SLEDAI score, complement consumption, presence of nephritis, anti-
dsDNA and other autoantibodies, as well as with type I interferon gene induction.
Our working hypothesis is that the biology of L1 is intimately connected with the pathogenesis of
SLE by two mechanisms: i) driving autoimmunity to the virus-like L1 protein complexes that
contain RNA and DNA; and ii) generating aberrant DNA by reverse-transcribing RNAs (including
its own) and triggering DNA-sensor signaling to induce type I IFNs.
AIM 1. To characterize the expression of L1 in SLE. The cell types that express the highest
levels of L1 in SLE are the neutrophil and the low-density granulocyte. The L1-expressing
neutrophils show signs of activation, and biomarkers of neutrophil NETosis are elevated in patient
serum. By RNA-Seq we have identified one dominant (chr4q22.1) and six additional distinct
human-specific L1 elements as the origins of the elevated transcripts and ORF1p protein. We will
solidify these observations, detect and analyze their dependence on patient gender and disease
parameters. We will examine factors that influence the transcription of these loci, and we will ask
if stress granules containing ORF1p are released from neutrophils undergoing NETosis or other
forms of cell death. These experiments will be complemented by asking if other proteins present
in stress granules are also autoantigens in SLE.
AIM 2. To elucidate the role of L1 ORF2p in type I IFN induction in SLE. Several recent
papers in top journals have demonstrated a connection between L1 expression and the induction
of IFN in cellular senescence, Crohn's disease, and in cancer cells. To determine how these
findings apply to SLE, we will analyze L1-expressing neutrophils for activated DNA sensors, the
signaling pathways from these sensors, and the type I IFN themselves. We will use an
ultrasensitive method to quantitate ORF2p and then use inhibitors of the its RT activity to
determine if it drives type I IFN production. Lastly, we will ask if silencing the DNA sensor
DAI/ZBP1 blocks this IFN production."

Moderate (<60%) O2 (hyperoxia) in premature infants promotes bronchial airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR)
via effects on airway smooth muscle (ASM), a cell type that also contributes to impaired bronchodilation, and
remodeling (proliferation, altered extracellular matrix (ECM)). Thus understanding mechanisms by which O2
affects bronchial airways is critical for therapeutic strategies in a vulnerable population. We propose a
protective role for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in developing airways that can be leveraged in prematurity, thus
providing clinical significance to our proposal. We hypothesize that the protective endogenous H2S system is
detrimentally influenced by O2, but that exogenous H2S donors can be used to counteract detrimental effects of
O2 on contractility and remodeling. Little is known regarding regulation of endogenous H2S in developing
bronchial airways, and mechanisms by which moderate O2 reduces H2S. Conversely, the mechanisms by which
H2S impacts on developing airways to alleviate O2 effects are unknown. We propose 3 Aims using human fetal
lung and in vivo neonatal mouse models of O2 to explore these concepts. Aim 1: In developing human ASM,
determine influence of O2 on endogenous H2S; Aim 2: In developing human ASM, determine mechanisms by
which H2S alleviates O2-enhanced airway contractility and remodeling; Aim 3: In a newborn mouse model of
hyperoxia, determine effects of H2S on airway contractility and remodeling. In Aim 1, we will use 18-22 wk
gestation human fetal ASM (fASM) to examine mechanisms by which O2 decreases H2S, focusing on ROS,
mitochondria, and alterations in the methionine-transsulfuration balance that can drive changes in the H2S
synthesis enzyme CBS. Aim 2 explores downstream effects of H2S (via donors NaHS and GYY4137, and
enhancement of endogenous H2S) in the context of contractility and remodeling following 40% O2. Here, the
focus is on three key mechanisms: suppression of HIF1α, activation of Nrf2, and enhancement of cAMP. In Aim
3, in vitro studies are integrated using a newborn mouse model of hyperoxia where early exposure to moderate
oxygen levels results in sustained AHR and remodeling. The efficacy of H2S donors in alleviating AHR and
remodeling is assessed. Clinical significance lies in establishing the importance of H2S in O2 effects on
developing airway towards future therapeutic targeting for neonatal asthma."
10758560,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem and one of the most prevalent chronic diseases
worldwide. DM ocular complications, diabetic retinopathy and diabetic keratopathy, are eminent risk factors for
visual deterioration in DM patients. Diabetic keratopathy is characterized by epithelial lesion, reduction of
epithelium thickness, oxidative stress, inflammation, decreased corneal nerve densities and declined corneal
sensitivities. The pathogenic mechanism for diabetic keratopathy is not fully understood, which represents a
major knowledge gap. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-α (PPARα) is a ligand-activated transcription
factor and a key regulator of lipid metabolism. Two large and prospective clinical studies reported independently
that the PPARα agonist fenofibrate has robust therapeutic effects on diabetic retinopathy. However, the
implication of PPARα in diabetic keratopathy remains to be investigated. Our studies in the past grant period
have demonstrated that: 1) PPARα levels are decreased in the corneas of diabetic human donors and of a
diabetic animal model. 2) Fenofibrate alleviates corneal nerve degeneration and decline of corneal sensitivity in
diabetes. 3) PPARα ablation alone induces corneal nerve degeneration. 4) Primary stromal cells from diabetic
human donors showed decreased neurotrophic secretion. 5) PPARα KO reduces production of neurotrophic
factors in the cornea. To investigate the molecular basis for these PPARα functions, our preliminary studies
found that fenofibrate prevents corneal mitochondrial dysfunction in a diabetic model, while PPARα KO
decreases mitochondrial function and contents in the cornea. This project will address a hypothesis that the
protective effect of PPARα against diabetes-induced corneal keratopathy and nerve degeneration is through
normalization of metabolic dysfunction in corneal cells and improving the neurotrophic microenvironment in the
cornea. We will investigate if activation or overexpression of PPARα will alleviate keratopathy and metabolic
deficiency in the diabetic cornea, while PPARα ablation in the cornea will exacerbate corneal nerve degeneration
and keratopathy in diabetes. We will also investigate the molecular mechanisms for the corneal
epithelium/stroma-nerve interactions, using established 3D in vitro and in vivo models. We will also determine if
PPARα promotes innervation via upregulation of neurotrophic factors in extracellular vesicles (EVs). In primary
human epithelial and stromal cells, we will determine if PPARα prevents metabolic deficiencies induced by
diabetic stressors. We will also investigate the role of PPARα in the modulation of autophagy/mitophagy and
cGAS-STING signaling in the corneal epithelium/stroma. The proposed studies will identify a novel function of
PPARα in the regulation corneal metabolism and a new pathogenic mechanism for diabetic keratopathy. The
hypotheses to be addressed here challenges the prevailing paradigm of diabetic keratopathy, and the findings
from this project will have the potential to reframe the future treatment modalities. Thus, this project has high
translational potential and may lead to a new therapeutic strategy for diabetic keratopathy."

The increasing rate of infection and spread of antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae poses an urgent
threat to public health. Knowledge of the genes and pathways that support evasion of the host immune response
and enable infection is needed to develop new strategies for surveillance, prevention, and treatment. Despite
our understanding of some of the gonococcal genes and alleles that confer resistance to serum-mediated killing,
significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the factors that influence the variation in serum resistance. We lack
a systematic evaluation of the pathways to resistance in clinical isolates: how complete is our understanding of
the genetic determinants of serum resistance? What is the prevalence and phylogenetic distribution of these
resistance genes and alleles? In this proposal, we address these gaps through a comprehensive strategy that
links experimental and computational identification of genetic variants that contribute to serum resistance and
defines their distribution in a dataset of >16,000 clinical isolate genome sequences.
The overall goal of this project is to systematically define the genetic contributors to serum resistance in N.
gonorrhoeae. We will achieve this goal through three specific aims, building on strategies that have been suc-
cessful in our work defining the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance and decades studying the mechanisms of
serum resistance. In Aim 1, we will leverage our collection of hundreds of clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae
from across the species phylogeny to define the phenotypic range of serum resistance and determine the genetic
contributors to serum resistance using a combination of phylogenetics, statistic methods, and transformation.
Our preliminary data supports this aim, with a genome-wide association study using serum resistance in 120
clinical isolates identifying known and novel candidate genetic variants that contribute to serum resistance. In
Aim 2, we will passage serum susceptible isolates from multiple genetic lineages in pooled human serum to
determine factors that contribute to serum resistance and describe the role of genomic background in shaping
the evolutionary trajectories to resistance. In Aim 3, we will characterize the prevalence and phylogenetic distri-
bution of genetic modulators of serum resistance—combining those in the literature with those identified in Aims
1 and 2—in a set of >16,000 clinical isolates for which we have genome sequences.
This project brings together the complementary and non-overlapping expertise of leading investigators in the
biology and genetics of N. gonorrhoeae, linking the study of serum resistance (Drs. Lewis and Ram) with ge-
nomics (Dr. Grad)."
10914772,"Current clinically prescribed analgesics target mu opioid receptors within the CNS and can produce
dangerous and often lethal adverse effects, including respiratory depression and addiction. Importantly, these
analgesics are principally responsible for precipitating the opioid crisis, which has only worsened with the SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic. Thus, alternative approaches for treatment of pain are badly needed. As evidenced by the
efficacy of local anesthetics, a promising approach to treat pain is to inhibit peripheral pain-sensing neurons
(nociceptors) that mediate pain neurotransmission. We have found that delta opioid receptor (DOR)-kappa opioid
receptor (KOR) heteromers are expressed and when activated produce strong and sustained antinociception.
Thus, the DOR-KOR heteromer may be a promising target for development of peripherally-restricted
analgesic drugs to treat nociceptive pain. In this application, we propose a multifaceted and highly collaborative
approach to identify small, drug-like molecules that selectively activate the DOR-KOR heteromer expressed by
nociceptors. Our approach to develop drugs that selectively activate the DOR-KOR heteromer is to take
advantage of a unique property of GPCR heteromers – interprotomer allosterism. Interprotomer allosterism is
where an orthosteric ligand for one of the protomers in the heteromeric pair allosterically alters the affinity and/or
intrinsic efficacy of the orthosteric ligand for the other protomer. We have demonstrated that such interprotomer
allosterism occurs for ligands acting at the DOR-KOR heteromer. Moreover, we have identified one ligand, 6’-
GNTI, that is an antagonist at both DOR and KOR in nociceptors, but via interprotomer allosterism, selectively
activates the DOR-KOR heteromer resulting in strong antinociception. Here we will take advantage of this inter-
protomer allosterism to identify novel heteromer-selective compounds. The Specific Aims of this project are to
identify novel DOR-KOR heteromer ligands using 1) a synthetic strategy based on structurally diverse chemical
series; 2) high-throughput screening (HTS) of chemical libraries of drug-like compounds; and 3) structure-based
in-silico screening of libraries of commercially-available chemical compounds. Hits will be initially identified using
HEK cell expression systems. Potential candidate compounds that emerge from the in vitro screens will undergo
ADME and receptor selectivity screening. Suitable compounds will then be screened for peripherally-mediated
antinociceptive efficacy mediated by the DOR-KOR heteromer in nociceptors in rats. Compounds that emerge
from this project (we expect ~5 compounds) will undergo further development using the NIH BPN UG3/UH3
program to advance candidates through IND-enabling toxicology and phase 1 clinical testing for safer and
effective treatment of pain. We also will have obtained valuable structure-activity relationship information about
the identified DOR and KOR ligands that will aid in the future design of DOR, KOR and DOR-KOR heteromer
ligands. Successful application of this approach (interprotomer allosterism) could be applied for other GPCR
heteromers to help further our understanding of the function of heteromers in physiological systems."
10738781,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tongue muscles, which are innervated by hypoglossal motoneurons (XIIMNs), are critical for survival given their
role in suckling, swallowing, mastication, breathing and more advanced functions such as human speech. The
hypoglossal motor nucleus is a bilateral collection of seven separate motoneuron pools, with motoneurons in
each pool innervating one of the seven different tongue muscles. We recently showed that XIIMNs innervating
the superior longitudinalis and genioglossus tongue muscles of neonatal rats have significantly different resting
membrane potentials, action potential firing thresholds, and f-I curves, i.e., the change in firing rate as a function
of injected current. These findings raise three very important questions: 1) what is the extent and nature of
phenotypic diversity both within and between individual XIIMN pools? 2) what are the anatomic and ionic
mechanisms that underlie this phenotypic diversity? 3) do structural and functional differences among XIIMNs in
each pool map to unique gene expression profiles? We propose a rational and robust approach to address these
questions: specifically, to describe the morphology, intrinsic membrane properties, and the transcriptome of
muscle specific XIIMNs. Our initial targets are XIIMNs innervating the genioglossus, hyoglossus and superior
longitudinalis muscles, as each muscle has different effects on tongue movement. Muscle-specific XIIMNs will
be identified by injecting each of the muscles with a retrograde tracer conjugated to a fluorescent reporter. All
experiments use brain tissue from neonatal rats 5-12 days of age. Key techniques include neuroanatomic tracing
to define neuron morphology, immunohistochemistry, whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology and next-
generation RNA sequencing. These basic science studies will identify unique molecular targets associated with
functional and/or structural differences between the motoneuron pools. Without this fundamental information,
interventions aimed at stimulating or inhibiting the activity of specific tongue muscles will be imprecise and may
result in unintended outcomes. In contrast, specific knowledge of unique molecular targets will focus the
development of therapeutic approaches aimed at stimulation and/or inhibition of specific tongue muscles.
Preliminary data show several pool-specific differences in motoneuron function and gene expression, strongly
suggesting that the proposed work will provide truly novel data on the anatomic, physiologic, and molecular
underpinnings of phenotypic diversity within and between muscle-specific hypoglossal motoneuron pools. This,
in turn, will lead to a major leap in our understanding of how the tongue muscles perform complex, coordinated
behaviors such as suckling, swallowing, and defense of the upper airway during sleep, and will lay the foundation
for the development of therapies aimed at controlling the activity of specific tongue muscles."
10752665,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this proposal is to identify optimal strategies for primary prevention of cardiovascular
disease (CVD) for survivors of breast (BC), prostate (PC) and lung (LC) cancer. All together, there are >6
million BC, PC and LC survivors in the US. While cancer is a major source of morbidity and mortality, the
majority of BC and PC as well as many early-stage LC survivors die of comorbidities, particularly CVD. Cancer
survivors have increased rates of both CVD risk factors as well as CVD itself, and CVD is the leading cause of
death among BC and PC survivors. Among LC survivors, CVD-related deaths account for ~30% of mortality;
this proportion is higher among the growing number identified with early-stage LC. In the general population,
primary prevention with lipid-lowering agents (i.e., statins) and aspirin is highly effective for decreasing CVD
incidence and mortality, but these guidelines for primary CVD prevention cannot be extrapolated to cancer
survivors. Approaches for CVD prevention in cancer survivors need to consider traditional risk factors
(including genetic risks) for CVD as well as CVD risk from certain cancer treatments. Additionally, competing
risks from cancer recurrence or comorbidities may limit the long-term benefits of primary CVD prevention.
Finally, the cancer itself, cancer treatment-related complications, and a higher prevalence of comorbidities can
negatively impact quality-of-life and attenuate the absolute improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy and
the cost effectiveness (CE) of primary CVD prevention. Lack of specific data applicable to cancer survivors has
profound negative impact, resulting in worse cardiovascular outcomes. It is unlikely that randomized controlled
trials (RCT) assessing the benefits of CVD preventive strategies for cancer survivors will be ever conducted.
Thus, there is an urgent need to use alternative methods to optimize preventive care recommendations for this
growing population. We propose using simulation modeling, an approach complementary to clinical trials, to
assess the harms, benefits, and CE of CVD prevention in diverse populations of cancer survivors. The Specific
Aims are to: (1) Develop an Integrated Multi-Ethnic Cancer model (IMEC) to incorporate the development,
progression, and outcomes of CVD among a diverse population of BC, PC and LC survivors; (2) Identify BC
survivors who will benefit from and determine the CE of primary CVD prevention; (3) Determine effectiveness
and CE of primary CVD prevention in PC survivors; and (4) Determine the most effective and CE CVD
prevention strategies for LC survivors. To achieve these Aims, we will use data from several large, diverse and
nationally representative, population-based cancer and cardiovascular cohorts to create, calibrate, and validate
IMEC (Aim 1). Then, we will use the model to test our hypothesis by conducting in-silico RCTs (Aims 2-4). Our
study is innovative in using state-of-the-art modeling methods and novel data harmonization, statistical and
simulation approaches to optimize the use of CVD preventive strategies in cancer survivors. The results will
have direct implications for the management of large numbers of survivors and guide patient decision-making."

The goal of this study is to understand how epigenetic states in oocytes that reside in primordial follicles
contribute to maintenance of the ovarian reserve in women. The ovarian reserve defines female reproductive
lifespan, which in humans spans decades due to maintenance of meiotic arrest in oocytes residing in
primordial follicles. The quality and quantity of oocytes are critical determinants for ovarian functions, and
exhaustion of primordial follicles triggers menopause. However, our understanding how the ovarian reserve is
generated and maintained is currently limited due to the inability to perform molecular analysis. In our
unpublished study, we developed a protocol to isolate the pool of non-growing oocytes that enabled molecular
analyses. We found that the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 establishes repressive chromatin states in
perinatal mouse oocytes that directly suppress the gene expression program of meiotic prophase-I and thereby
enable the transition to dictyate arrest. Based on these findings, we propose that the chromatin state is
established during perinatal oogenesis that enables ovarian reserve formation and then maintained in adult
and aged ovaries. In Aim 1, we will perform a comprehensive chromatin profiling of the initial pools of non-
growing oocytes from juvenile ovaries and the ovarian reserve maintained in adulthood. Aim 1 will establish an
epigenome data resource of the ovarian reserve. In Aim2, we designed a candidate-based approach to define
the regulatory mechanism of chromatin states in the ovarian reserve. We will determine the function of CHD4,
a chromatin remodeler, in maintaining the ovarian reserve. Aim 2 will provide the foundation to investigate the
chromatin-based maintenance mechanisms of the ovarian reserve. The proposed research will significantly
advance the field by providing molecular insights how the epigenome of the ovarian reserve is established and
maintained."

The US is facing a crisis of opioid overdoses and addiction. Current therapies consist largely of alternative
opioids (i.e. maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine) and do not correct neurobiological factors that
underlie drug craving and relapse. These factors include the long-lasting changes at glutamatergic synapses in
the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which both resemble and differ from changes induced by other highly addictive
drugs such as cocaine. Our recent studies suggest these synaptic effects of opioids are opposed by acid-
sensing ion channels (ASICs). ASICs conduct inward Na+ and Ca2+ current at post-synaptic dendritic spines
where they are activated during synaptic transmission by protons released into the synaptic cleft from
neurotransmitter-containing vesicles. Because these protons are removed from the synaptic cleft via the
actions of carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4), genetically disrupting CA4 or pharmacologically inhibiting CA4 with
acetazolamide (AZD) dramatically increases synaptic ASIC currents. These observations have led to our
hypothesis that AZD will reverse synaptic changes following opioid withdrawal by inhibiting CA4 and
increasing ASIC activity, and thereby reduce craving and relapse. In this proposal we plan to test this
hypothesis by rigorously assessing effects of opioids on synaptic physiology and behavior. Together the
experiments in this proposal will pave the way to a better understanding of the neurobiology underlying opioid
addiction and to new molecular targets for treating opioid use disorder (OUD). Knowledge gained from these
studies could suggest new ways to treat opioid addiction through non-opioidergic mechanisms, for example by
manipulating ASICs, brain pH, or carbonic anhydrase, for which a number of inhibitors are already approved
for human use, and might be efficiently repurposed."

Cells within populations act collectively, allowing them to behave in ways that exceed the capability of a single
cell. At the same time, even a genetically homogenous population exhibits phenotypic diversity, allowing the
population to adapt in unpredictable environments. Both of these features complicate treatment of cancer,
infections, and diseases. It is of critical importance to understand how phenotypic diversity modulates a
population’s behaviors, yet this interaction is not fully understood. The proposed project will address this
knowledge gap by studying the collective migration of commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Groups of bacteria
(and eukaryotic cells) can migrate collectively by consuming attractants in the environment and chasing the
moving gradient that they have created. This allows cell populations to travel over much longer distances than
what can be achieved by an individual cell following external gradients. Our lab found that bacterial cells within
migrating groups spatially organize themselves by their chemotaxis abilities, or the speeds at which they climb
chemical gradients. This spatial organization within the migrating group allows cells with diverse motility
behaviors to migrate together because it places high performers at the front, where the traveling gradient is
shallower, and low performers near the back, where the traveling gradient is steeper. Here, I will examine the
consequences of this spatial organization for populations that are migrating in different environments and
performing pathogenesis. Aim 1 will determine how the spatial organization of motility behaviors in a
bacterial population is altered when the physical properties of the environment are changed. Then, Aim
2 will explore to what extent a population of a human pathogen utilizes the spatial organization of
secondary messenger levels and motility behaviors to co-sort virulence phenotypes. Our findings will be
used to develop a mathematical model that describes how a migrating group of cells alters the spatial
organization of its phenotypes to migrate across different environments. They will also provide insights on how
the spatial organization of swimming behaviors can lead to co-organization of secondary messenger levels and
virulence traits, allowing pathogens to perform multiple infection-related tasks simultaneously during migration.
Because some of the basic mechanisms involved – e.g. phenotypic diversity in motility and the degradation or
consumption of an external attractant to drive the collective behavior – are also present during the collective
migration of immune cells and cancer cells, the findings in the project will be relevant beyond microbiology."

Aging is an inexorable, multifactorial process in which organisms lose fitness and ability to maintain
homeostasis. With advances in modern medicine and standards of living across the globe, life expectancy, and
thus aging, is set to expand rapidly. Cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and other age-associated
dementias is one of the most debilitating aspects of aging, robbing millions of people of everyday function and
independence. Healthier aging and independence are potentially worth trillions of dollars in addition to
unquantifiable social and emotional benefits. As we get older, our cells are not the only thing in our body that
age. The microbiome is the collection of trillions of microorganisms that inhabit our gastrointestinal tract. Like
organ systems, the microbiome also changes with age, losing diversity and gaining deleterious species. It is
widely accepted that the microbiome plays an important role in metabolism, digestion, and obesity, but recently
it has also been linked to disease processes in the brain, such as autism and depression. The vagus nerve
connects the central and enteric nervous systems to mediate gut-to-brain signaling, and its ablation has been
shown to induce cognitive deficits in rats. Additionally, it has also been shown that performing fecal microbiome
transplants (FMT) from old mice into young germ-free mice induces cognitive deficits. In initial experiments, I
have shown that passive transfer of the microbiome by cohousing young and old mice induces cognitive
deficits in young mice. This effect is not seen in cohoused germ-free or antibiotics-treated mice and is
reproduced upon FMT into young germ-free mice from old stool donors. Ablating or inhibiting afferent vagal
neurons also induces a cognitive deficit, while vagal stimulation with low dose capsaicin or hormonal activation
reverses deficits associated with the aged microbiome. Thus, I propose that the aged microbiome impairs
cognition through inhibition of gut-to-brain signaling. To explore this, I will first use bacterial sequencing to
identify bacterial species in the aged microbiome that are sufficient to induce cognitive deficits (Aim 1). Next, I
will determine which components of gut-to-brain signaling are required for learning and memory (Aim 2).
Finally, I will characterize the effects of the aged microbiome with brain-wide mapping of neuronal activation
during memory encoding (Aim 3). These studies will provide insight into understudied mechanisms of aging
and potentially identify new targets to combat age-associated cognitive decline. I have collected a significant
amount of preliminary data and possess the tools and skills required to pursue these aims. The institutional
support and resources of the University of Pennsylvania, along with the expertise and mentorship of my
sponsors, Dr. Virginia Lee, internationally renowned for her research in neurodegeneration, and Dr. Christoph
Thaiss, a microbiome expert, maximize my chances at success. The training I will receive during this proposal
will position me to be a future leader in aging and neurodegeneration as a physician-scientist."
10849634,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common liver cancer seen in children and has a poor overall survival in
patients that present with vascular invasion (VI). Standard of care treatments with additional chemotherapy and
surgical treatment have been developed, but despite this aggressive treatment, the survival rate remains
<50%. Furthermore, our group recently reported that HB patients with microvascular invasion (micro-VI) had
worse overall survival rates than those without micro-VI. Despite the understanding that VI is the precursor to
multifocal disease and metastasis, little is known about the mechanisms that enable VI in HB, nor are there
any targeted therapies to address this mechanism of disease. Therefore, to create effective therapies, further
understanding of the biomarkers and biology of VI in HB is critically needed. Our prior work identified the
JAK/STAT3 pathway as being significantly upregulated in the tumor thrombus of patients with high-risk HB and
VI. In addition, downstream targets of the JAK/STAT3 pathway were upregulated in a patient-derived xenograft
model of high-risk HB, and STAT3 inhibition in our patient-derived cell lines countered HB cell growth and
invasion. Based on the rigor of our and other’s prior research, we hypothesize that HB tumors with VI exhibit
unique expression signatures that involve JAK/STAT3 signal activation, which can inform the development of
VI-targeted therapies. To address this, our first aim (Aim 1) will be to investigate changes in protein expression
between HB cells in the primary tumor and those involved in VI to identify a VI-specific protein signature using
innovative Phenocycler analysis. This signature will then be validated in a cohort of FFPE patient tissues as a
novel biomarker panel to identify patients at risk for VI, as well as pathway targets for future drug development.
Then in Aim 2, we will study the role of JAK/STAT3 in VI. Our laboratory has shown that JAK/STAT3 plays a
role in enabling cancer cells to invade the blood, emphasizing the role that JAK/STAT3 may have in HB
metastasis and VI. Using gain- and loss-of-function assays, we will prove the necessity and sufficiency of
STAT3 function to drive HB tumor cell invasion. We will then test targeted JAK/STAT3 pathway inhibitors in
vitro and in vivo using two of our unique high-risk patient derived xenograft models as a validation tool. Taken
together, these aims will result in new prediction models and preclinical data to inform future clinical trials for
high-risk HB patients with VI. Completion of this project will also provide me with a foundation in novel research
techniques and help develop my scientific acumen so that I can build a successful career as a surgeon-
scientist."

Individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have an approximately 160-fold increased risk of developing
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). As a leading cause of death for NF1 patients. MPNST
has no effective therapy and thus there is an urgent need for new therapies. The dramatically increased risk of
developing MPNSTs is caused by the presence of plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs), the major benign precursor
lesion for NF1-MPNST. It has been proposed that PNFs are congenital lesions, arising from the early stages of
nerve development when neural-crest stem cells differentiate into Schwann cell (SC) lineages, which give rise
to either myelinating or nonmyelinating SCs (mSCs or nmSCs). In the normal nerve, unmyelinated axons are
sorted and ensheathed by nmSCs into individual pockets, forming Remak bundles. Whereas no defect in SC
precursors or mSCs was observed, Nf1 loss (Nf1-/-) during early nerve development induced a pocket defect in
Remak bundles, characterized by abnormally sorted unmyelinated axons. These abnormal Remak pockets
progress to a stage with axonal degeneration and abnormal proliferation of dissociated SCs, leading to the
formation of PNFs. Axonal degeneration may contribute to PNF formation by inducing a nerve injury
environment, a concept supported by the observation that Nf1 loss in mature SCs is not sufficient to induce
PNFs unless an injury to the nerve occurs. Malignant transformation of PNFs to MPNSTs requires at least two
additional genetic alterations: sequential inactivation of CDKN2A, and then either SUZ12 or EED - two
essential components of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 catalyzes histone modification
H3K27me3 to repress gene expression throughout the genome. Loss of PRC2 specifically observed in
MPNSTs, but not in benign tumors, suggests that PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 normally represses expression
of the oncogenic drivers responsible for malignant transformation of PNFs to MPNSTs. However, Eed/PRC2 is
dispensable during normal mouse SC development and myelination. Further, loss of the Eed/PRC2 tumor
suppressor unexpectedly inhibits proliferation of injury-induced reprogrammed SCs, accompanied by
derepression of Cdkn2a expression. Here, we propose to test two related hypotheses: (1) the developmental
Nf1-/- Remak pocket defect and its associated axonal degeneration (nerve injury) drive Nf1-/- SCs to form PNFs
and (2) nerve injury response induces an epigenomic switch, rendering reprogrammed PNFs or SCs
susceptible to malignant transformation by sequential loss of CDKN2A and PRC2. We will determine the role
of the developmental Remak pocket defect in NF1-MPNST formation (Aim 1), investigate tumor suppressive
mechanisms in injury-induced reprogramed SCs (Aim 2), and develop therapeutic strategies based on the
injury-induced epigenomic switch in reprogrammed SCs (Aim 3). We will identify injury-induced and PRC2-
repressed oncogenic drivers for MPNST formation via epigenomic approaches, develop synergistic therapies
using a high-throughput drug repurposing screen, and test them GEM- and patient-derived preclinical models."

Mutations in tafazzin (Taz, also known as G4.5) cause Barth syndrome (BTHS, MIM 302060), a life-threatening
disorder disrupting metabolism of the mitochondrial-specific phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). Cardiomyopathy is
the major clinical feature in BTHS, highlighting the importance of Taz and the CL metabolism pathway in
cardiomyocytes (CMs). Taz encodes a mitochondrial phospholipid-lysophospholipid transacylase, which is
essential for CL remodeling to achieve the characteristic fatty acid composition of mature CL. Mutations in Taz
found in BTHS patients result in low total CL concentrations, abnormal CL fatty acyl composition, and elevated
monolyso-CL (MLCL) to CL ratios. However, little is known as to the detailed molecular mechanisms by which
Taz deficiency and consequent CL abnormalities lead to the progression of cardiomyopathy. Thus far, there is
no curative therapy for BTHS. Although it has been established that Taz deficiency causes BTHS, lack of a
Taz knockout mouse model has hindered studies of molecular pathology and developments of therapeutic
approaches for BTHS. To elucidate the molecular pathogenic mechanism of BTHS cardiomyopathy, and to
identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention, we have generated Taz CM-specific knockout (cKO) mice
and observed dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) phenotypes, as well as mitochondrial malformations and
dysfunction in Taz cKO mice. Our data strongly suggest a critical role of Taz and CL in cardiac and
mitochondrial function. Our Taz cKO mouse provides us with a unique model to investigate the molecular basis
for and potential therapeutic approaches to BTHS. Studies in cultured cells suggest that linoleic acid (LA)
supplementation increases mature CL levels in Taz-deficient cells by increasing incorporation of linoleoyl
groups into de novo synthesized CL and also ameliorating the increase in MLCL. Inhibition of the mitochondrial
phospholipase A2 (PLA2) by bromoenol lactone (BEL) also ameliorates increased MLCL in Taz-deficient cells
by blocking generation of MLCL from nascent CL. However, these potential therapeutic approaches have not
been studied in an in vivo mammalian model of BTHS. Moreover, no study has explored if a combination of LA
supplementation and BEL treatment can act synergistically to ameliorate BTHS. Accordingly, our hypothesis is
that Taz-mediated CL remodeling is essential to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis and CM function, and that
linoleic acid (LA) and/or bromoenol lactone (BEL) treatment will provide beneficial effects to ameliorate BTHS
cardiomyopathy. Our specific aims are: (1) To investigate the role and molecular mechanisms by which Taz-
mediated CL remodeling is required in maintaining CM mitochondrial homeostasis and normal cardiac function
by histological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular analyses of Taz cKO mice; and (2) To assess
therapeutic effects of linoleic acid (LA) and mitochondrial PLA2 inhibitor bromoenol lactone (BEL), as single
agents or in combination, on BTHS cardiomyopathy by utilizing Taz cKO mice."
10847356,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting as many as
1:200 individuals in the general population. HCM, initially described in the context of sudden cardiac death (SCD),
is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Rigorous research over the past two
decades has enabled us to identify HCM patients at the greatest risk of SCD who could benefit from a
prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With advances in SCD prevention, HCM management
has now shifted its focus to HF and AF. Nearly 50% of HCM patients have mild to severe HF symptoms. HF is
now considered the most common cause of HCM-related mortality. AF is the most common sustained
arrhythmia, occurring in nearly 25% of HCM patients, and responsible for a decreased quality of life and
increased stroke risk. Currently, we are not able to predict which HCM patients are more likely to progress toward
end-stage HF or develop AF. Cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography and cardiac MR has played a
central role in our evolving understanding of HCM. Echocardiography provides a robust assessment of left
ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. With its high spatial resolution and remarkable
tissue characterization capabilities, cardiac MR has emerged as an imaging modality well suited to characterize
the HCM phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel risk stratification paradigms by leveraging
recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve HCM patient management. We will investigate a deep
learning (DL) risk model for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that incorporates (a) standard clinical
and imaging parameters and (b) novel cardiac MR signatures extracted using (i) radiomic analysis (i.e. a
computational method to automatically extract and select clinically significant imaging markers) or (ii) deep
imaging signatures, extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The performance of these
models will be rigorously evaluated using 3 HCM cohorts collected at Tufts Medical Center, BIDMC, and
University of Toronto."
10806220,"Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD), or Krabbe, is a fatal pediatric neurodegenerative disease caused by
mutations in GALC. It is so-named due to the appearance of globoid cell macrophages. The major hurdle to
curing GLD is treatment of central nervous system (CNS) pathology. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
is the only treatment, but is not curative, and must be administered presymptomatically in early infancy. HSCT
is thought to work by therapeutic engraftment of donor macrophages and replacement of globoid cells, but in the
brain, does so inefficiently. Despite being pathognomonic for GLD, little is known about globoid cells in the brain
- their function, origin, and formation. It is unknown if globoid cells arise from embryonically-derived tissue
resident microglia or HSC-derived infiltrating macrophages, the degree to which they are pathogenic, and if their
replacement is key to GLD treatment. This is a critical knowledge gap that has limited the advancement of more
effective GLD therapies and is the focus of this proposal. Our central hypothesis is that globoid cells are
unique reactive microglia and that robust replacement by “true” microglia is sufficient to treat GLD CNS
neuropathology. We are experts in the study of brain macrophages by direct CNS transplantation in mice. The
twitcher (GALCKO) mouse is a widely accepted model of GLD. We created new methods to 1) distinguish
microglia, infiltrating macrophages, and transplanted donor macrophages from each other and 2) replace host
brain macrophages with directly injected cells at high efficiency without HSCT, including by engineering the first
small molecule inhibitor-resistant variant of CSF1R, a survival receptor for brain macrophages. In this proposal,
we will apply these new methods in the GALCKO model to determine the role of brain macrophages in GLD
pathogenesis and treatment. In Aim 1, we will define the origin and transcriptomic identity of all reactive brain
macrophages, including globoid cells, in GALCKO, including after HSCT. This knowledge promises to reveal new
therapeutic targets for GLD. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that direct replacement of GALCKO microglia
with healthy surrogates eliminates globoid cells and drives the neurotherapeutic effects of HSCT. If true, this
approach has great translational potential to maximize engraftment efficiency and broaden the therapeutic
window for cell therapy. Finally in Aim 3, we will determine if HSC-derived cells are effective microglial
surrogates, given the distinct functions of non-microglial macrophages in the CNS. This will guide future work to
enhance the efficacy of cell therapies for brain diseases. Completion of these aims will fill longstanding
knowledge gaps about the role of microglia and other macrophages in the pathogenesis and treatment of
pediatric neurodegenerative diseases."
10892041,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
Children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) typically have severe deficits in domains of daily functioning
like communication, which families consistently list as one of their top clinical priorities. However, existing clinical
outcome assessments (COAs) have major limitations, including the inability to discriminate among individuals with
low communication ability and/or are primarily nonverbal. Further, there are no current caregiver-reported measures
designed for clinical trials that have high quality validity evidence for individuals with NDDs.
To address this critical need, our team designed the Observer-Reported Communication Ability (ORCA) measure to
assess expressive, receptive, and pragmatic forms of communication, regardless of the modalities used by a child
(e.g., vocalizations, gestures, assistive devices). Qualitative and quantitative evidence support its validity for
individuals with Angelman syndrome, and excitingly, the ORCA is likely to be generalizable to other NDD
populations. This proposed study will allow us to use rigorous development methods to expand the ORCA measure
to a broad range of NDD populations and, using existing COAs, provide investigators with a comprehensive set of
tools to evaluate changes in communication ability in NDD populations in pediatric clinical trials.
Our study team includes experts in COA development, communication, clinical trials, and neuropsychology.
Importantly, the team also includes a Stakeholder Engagement Group (SEG) consisting of 16 leaders in the field; 12
parents/patient advocates and 4 clinicians who will provide access to 13 distinct NDD populations for the studies
planned in this proposal. An External Technical Advisory Committee (ETAC) will provide additional guidance and
consists of clinicians, methodologists, speech-language pathologists, industry experts, and patient advocates.
In the 2-year UG3 planning phase, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 8-12 parents for each of our 13 NDDs
and with 8-12 communication experts to identify the core concepts of communication for each of the NDDs (Aim 1).
We will use the results from the qualitative interviews and data collected in seven ongoing natural history studies to
develop targeted plans for the UH3 implementation phase to expand and validate the ORCA measure for each of
the 13 NDDs (Aim 2). In the 3-year UH3 phase, we will expand the ORCA measure and conduct, as needed,
additional qualitative interviews and longitudinal quantitative studies to evaluate the reliability, validity and
responsiveness of the ORCA measure alongside other communication COAs (Aim 3). Finally, we will have
approximately 1500 caregivers of typically developing children from birth to <6 years of age complete the expanded
ORCA measure twice (6-months apart) to estimate age-based norm scores and examine responsiveness of the
ORCA measure over time. With constant feedback from the SEG and the ETAC, we will provide an expanded
ORCA measure to the research field that can capture communication ability across a diverse range of NDDs, and
an endpoint framework for researchers to evaluate the efficacy of interventions using an outcome that is important to
families of children and adolescents with NDDs."
10843159,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As much as 10% of the population suffers from a rare disease (RD); 80% of these diseases are caused by
gene mutations and up to 75% are present at birth or begin in childhood. Diagnosis of genetic diseases is often
problematic: roughly 25% of RD patients must wait between 5 and 30 years for a diagnosis, and about half of
the initial diagnoses are wrong. For many affected children, definitive diagnosis comes only after a protracted
and frustrating odyssey of visits to different specialists. Emerging genetic sequencing techniques offer the
possibility of shortening this long and costly path to diagnosis. Methods for determining the changes in gene
sequences across all genes (exome sequencing) or all genetic material (genome sequencing), collectively
referred to as Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and which were first used to identify the genetic cause of a
disease in 2010, are now becoming routine in the clinic. The ability to make a diagnosis with NGS has more
than doubled since 2010 for children with suspected genetic diseases. The diagnostic analysis of NGS data
involves the assessment of tens of thousands (exome) or even millions (genome) of changes in the DNA
(variants), which requires sophisticated computer algorithms that can sift through these/this data to find the
cause. Our group has developed the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), a resource widely used around the
world for the computational analysis of clinical data in human genetics and pediatrics, allowing algorithms to
match the symptoms of a patient with database records of over 7,000 genetic diseases.
Our Exomiser software compares the clinical phenotypes of patients with known human diseases and
genetically modified animal models, and couples this with an analysis of the disease-causing potential of DNA
variants, greatly reducing the search space to identify the causal variant. Exomiser efficiently processes both
exome and genome data. In this proposal, we plan to extend Exomiser to utilize new genomic data types
including long-read genome sequencing and NGS-based analysis of RNA data, which will improve
pathogenicity prediction for structural variants (SVs) and for variants affecting gene expression or splicing. We
will also predict novel disease genes through characterization of networks of clinical phenotypes and the
molecular functions (pathways) of affected genes. We plan to use these algorithms to assess collections
(cohorts) of unsolved cases in projects such as the 100,000 Genomes Project. Our algorithmic approach will
be applied to intelligently reanalyze unsolved cases periodically as new information is added to the medical
literature. And finally, we will develop tools to integrate Exomiser into a large range of settings by adding
support for standards generated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). The proposed
advances will make Exomiser more efficient, more accurate, and easier for non-specialist pediatricians to use,
bringing genomic diagnostics to routine pediatric clinical care."
10862793,"Project Summary / Abstract
This project investigates the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern vertebrate photoreceptor outer
segment (OS) structure, a fundamental unsolved problem in photoreceptor cell biology. This basic science
knowledge gap severely limits clinical understanding of (and treatments for) blinding diseases in humans and
animals caused by mutations that disrupt OS structure. A broad variety of inherited retinal degenerations
(IRDs) are caused by mutations that disrupt OS organelle structure. Because normal OS structure is required
for healthy vision but is not yet understood, it is essential to advance knowledge of how the many hundreds of
membranous disks required by each rod and cone are properly shaped and stabilized.
The most longstanding and well-known examples of IRDs triggered by abnormal OS structure are caused by
mutations in peripherin-2/rds (P/rds). This proposal builds upon our demonstration in the previous project
period that P/rds directly generates membrane curvature, to precisely sculpt the hundreds of membranous disk
rims present in rod and cone OSs. This advance provides a clear mechanistic explanation for the general
effects of P/rds mutations on OS structure, but leaves open the critical and fundamental questions of how P/rds
activity is regulated, and how inherited defects in P/rds generate a diversity of disease phenotypes. Our central
hypothesis is that regulation of P/rds function by heterotypic interactions with rom1 and glutamic acid-rich
proteins (GARPs) contributes to differences between rod and cone OS disk structures. The research strategy
will therefore identify how P/rds works together with rom1 and GARPs to build and maintain normal OS
structure, and will investigate the significance of these proteins for rod vs. cone disk architectures and how
mutations can disrupt organelle structure to trigger particular retinal diseases.
An integrated approach using contributions from human molecular genetics, in vitro biochemistry, in cellulo
functional assays, and in situ analyses of engineered vertebrate animal models will be utilized to carry out the
research. Specific Aim 1 will elucidate the significance of heterotypic (rom1 and GARP) interactions for P/rds
structure, molecular function, and support of OS disk architecture. Specific Aim 2 will identify differential
contributions of P/rds to rod and cone structures and viability.
Overall, these studies are expected to clarify how normal rod and cone OS disk structures are generated and
stabilized by photoreceptor-specific proteins that are essential for human retinal health and vision. This work
will also provide an improved mechanistic basis for understanding how pathogenic mutations in P/rds can
differentially impact rods and cones to produce a broad heterogeneity of IRDs."

Spinal muscular atrophies (SMAs) are monogenetic motor neuron (MN) diseases that cause debilitating
muscle weakness and often early mortality. My research program focuses on advancing therapeutics for two
forms of SMA: proximal SMA caused by recessive, loss-of-function mutations of the survival motor neuron 1
gene (SMN1) and distal SMA (dSMA) caused by dominant mutations of the transient receptor potential
vanilloid 4 gene (TRPV4). Our overarching approach is to integrate findings from human patients with
experimentation in animal and iPSC-derived models to elucidate pathomechanistic pathways relevant to
human disease and identify promising therapeutic opportunities. Here, we will leverage unique resources and
state-of-the-art technologies to define factors limiting efficacy of current SMA therapeutics, characterize cellular
and molecular mechanisms driving SMA pathology, and identify and validate novel therapeutic strategies.
Proximal SMA is at the forefront of rapidly evolving gene-targeting therapeutics, with two recently approved
SMN-inducing treatments and a third under FDA review. While a transformative success, the clinical efficacy of
these treatments is highly variable, ranging from normal attainment of early motor milestones to no
improvement in motor function. In the last 5 years, our studies have revealed that proximal SMA pathology
begins in utero, before treatments are currently initiated in patients. In both humans and mice, SMA MNs
exhibit impaired maturation during gestation and precipitous neonatal degeneration, paralleled by a marked
decline in SMN expression. Here, we will build on these observations to 1) dissect the specific mechanisms
regulating SMN expression during development and treatment, 2) identify the molecular mechanisms causing
impaired maturation and degeneration of SMA MNs, and 3) use these insights to develop novel and in utero
SMA therapeutic strategies. In parallel studies on dSMA, we have recently demonstrated that neuropathogenic
mutations in TRPV4, a cell surface cation channel, disrupt regulatory protein-protein interactions and cause a
gain of channel function. Existing TRPV4 antagonists have good tolerability in humans, making the channel a
promising therapeutic target. Strikingly, mutant TRPV4 knock-in mouse models develop severe neurological
phenotypes due to focal breakdown of blood-neural barriers (BNBs), which are rescued by selective genetic
deletion of TRPV4 from endothelial cells (ECs) or treatment of symptomatic mice with TRPV4 antagonists.
These studies suggest that TRPV4 activation can drive neuropathology in a non-cell autonomous manner by
regulating BNBs. Here, we will 1) characterize protein interactions regulating TRPV4 channel activity, 2)
evaluate the role of TRPV4 in modulating EC barrier function, and 3) assess TRPV4 antagonists as a
therapeutic strategy in dSMA mice and ultimately other disorders characterized by BNB disruption. Together,
our studies will further our mechanistic understanding of SMA pathology, delineate novel therapeutic targets
and strategies, and advance care of patients with SMAs and related neuromuscular diseases."

In each of our trillions of cells, genetic information is stored on meter-long chromosomes spatially organized
inside micron-scale nuclei. In the past decade, large-scale efforts have built increasingly detailed atlases of
transcription, regulatory elements, and genome folding across ever-expanding sets of cell types and tissues.
Still, these beautiful maps do not by themselves reveal the sequences or molecular mechanisms acting in
these diverse cellular contexts. Drawing on approaches from biophysics, bioinformatics, and machine learning,
this project will develop novel computational approaches to determine the DNA sequences and mechanisms
underlying 3D genome organization, and how this in turn relates to genomic functions. Drawing on the latest
breakthroughs in machine learning, we will model how individual nucleotides contribute to genome folding. We
will apply these models to characterize cell-type specific genome folding, develop methods to engineer DNA
sequences in silico, and model enhancer-promoter influences. Concurrently, we will build biophysical models
to understand deeply conserved mechanisms of genome folding. Using meiotic chromosome folding as a
model system, we will develop models to learn new rules governing cohesin dynamics and loop extrusion. To
uncover how extrusion interfaces with other mechanisms, we will build models of synaptonemal complex
assembly, as well as models of meiotic chromosome organization across species. By honing in on the
sequences most crucial for locus-specific genome folding and characterizing the mechanisms driving genome-
wide folding, the computational models we develop and the mechanisms we discover will enable new
approaches to precision genome engineering. This will include how to re-wire gene-regulatory circuits, not only
by targeting enhancers and promoters, but also by modulating their cell-type specific communication. At the
same time, the aims described here will bridge fundamental insights into 3D chromosome organization with
clinical genomics, and greatly improve the interpretability of non-coding DNA variants."
10833551,"Project Summary:
Salt-sensitivity of blood pressure (SSBP) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality not only in
hypertensive, but also in normotensive adults. The diagnosis for SSBP is not feasible in the clinic due to lack of
a simple diagnostic test, making it difficult to investigate therapeutic strategies. Most research efforts to
understand the mechanisms of SSBP have focused on renal regulation of sodium (Na+). However, salt retention
or plasma volume expansion are not enhanced in salt sensitive (SS) versus salt resistant (SR) individuals. In
addition, over 70% of extracellular fluid is interstitial and therefore not directly controlled by renal salt and water
excretion. Thus, further research is needed to understand the extrarenal mechanisms contributing to SSBP.
We recently found that Na+ enters monocyte-derived dendritic cells through the amiloride sensitive epithelial Na+
channel (ENaC) and activates the NADPH oxidase leading to formation of highly reactive products of lipid
oxidation known as isolevuglandins (IsoLGs). IsoLGs adduct to self-proteins and act as neoantigens, which
activate T cells to produce cytokines that promote Na+ retention and blood pressure (BP) elevation. Interestingly,
analogous to SSBP, we found considerable variability in the response of human monocytes to in vitro exposure
to elevated Na+ which correlated with known cardiovascular risk factors. It is not known if this variability in the
responsiveness of monocytes to elevated Na+ happens in vivo and if it contributes to the SSBP.
Recent studies found that Na+ accumulates in the interstitium electrostatically bound to glycosaminoglycans but
can be mobilized. This is relevant to circulating monocytes as they enter and re-emerge from the interstitium with
increased ability to present antigens. Our data indicate that monocytes from humans with high skin Na+ are
activated and have increased IsoLGs. This R01 proposal presents an opportunity to study how immune activation
and interstitial Na+ interact to impact SSBP in well phenotyped SS and SR individuals. We hypothesize that
circulating monocytes transmigrate into regions of elevated Na+ including the skin, muscle and kidney, and are
activated via IsoLG-adduct formation leading to SSBP. In Aim 1, we will employ an inpatient Weinberger protocol
to classify participants as SS or SR and measure tissue Na+ using 23NaMRI to determine if tissue Na+ and
monocyte activation contribute to SSBP. In Aim 2, we will adoptively transfer monocytes with T cells from SS
and SR people into immunodeficient NSG-(KbDb)null (IA)null mice and determine if monocytes from humans with
SSBP induce T cell activation, endothelial dysfunction, end-organ damage and SSBP in the humanized mice.
These translational studies will advance the field and reveal more feasible and cost-effective diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies for SSBP. Our exciting preliminary data indicating that changes in monocyte IsoLGs mirror
changes in BP in response to salt provide promise for not only a simple diagnostic tool, but also mechanistic
insight into the pathogenesis of SSBP. Alongside efforts to develop therapies for SSBP by focusing on the kidney,
we propose that interstitial Na+ and monocyte activation via IsoLGs are important targets."

Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The
rise in suicide rates is due in part to a failure to identify short-term risk factors for suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. Additionally, most existing research relies primarily on group-level methodological approaches to
suicide risk assessment; intraindividual suicide risk processes are largely neglected. Because of the lack of
knowledge on short-term and individual-level suicide risk, it remains unclear when and how to intervene with
the individual adolescents who need it most. Three particularly promising observable, state-sensitive,
temporally delimited, and modifiable proximal indicators of suicide risk among adolescents are social
engagement, sleep, and physical activity. Although acute changes in these behavioral processes are often
denoted as imminent “behavioral warning signs” of suicide, most existing research has examined these
behavioral factors only as distal predictors and correlates of suicide risk. Importantly, their contribution to short-
term risk using individual-level approaches (i.e., fully idiographic, “n-of-1” methods) remains unknown. The
Candidate’s proposed K23’s overarching goal is to employ mobile sensing and actigraphy to assess whether
objectively and passively measured acute behavioral changes from typical patterns of social engagement,
sleep, and physical activity indicate proximal risk for increases in suicidal ideation using idiographic n-of-1
models in high-risk adolescents. It further aims to characterize the intraindividual network structure of these
behavioral factors and suicidal ideation to enhance suicide risk assessment and guide intervention.
Adolescents (N=100) admitted to an inpatient or partial hospital program due to acute suicide risk will be
recruited. For a period of 3 months, wearable actigraphs will be used to assess adolescents’ sleep and
physical activity and mobile sensing will be used to assess adolescents’ digital social engagement and patterns
of movement to approximate additional indices of physical activity. Once-daily mobile surveys will be used to
assess suicidal ideation. The proposed training plan complements the Candidate’s research plan and will
facilitate training in: conducting translational digital health research in high-risk adolescents, passive mobile
sensing, passive adolescent sleep and physical activity assessment via actigraphy, and advanced
computational approaches to person-specific intensive data modeling. A team of leading scholars will provide
expert mentorship to facilitate the Candidate’s training goals within the highly resourced environment of the
Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. The proposed study will promote the
Candidate’s long-term career goal to employ low-burden and scalable methods of assessment to develop
personalized risk models that will improve the proximal prediction of suicide risk and inform intervention for
youth. Through the execution of this research and training plan, the Candidate will be positioned to become a
leader in the field of adolescent suicide."

The T32 Neuroscience Training Program (NTP) at Berkeley seeks to provide broad-based neuroscience PhD
training, with an emphasis on advanced research methods and quantitative approaches. Our 60 training
faculty are from 12 departments and span molecular to cognitive neuroscience, new methods development,
and disease-related research. The NTP supports Year 1-2 students from the Neuroscience PhD Program
(the largest pool of neuroscience-focused students at Berkeley) plus a smaller number from 3 additional PhD
programs who train in our faculty laboratories.
 Our program provides training across a wide range of neuroscience from molecules to mind. We
combine flexible coursework, rigorous research training, quantitative skills, and a major focus on advanced
research methods. We have a multi-disciplinary approach to neuroscience that leverages Berkeley’s deep
expertise in molecular and cell biology, physical and computational sciences, engineering and psychology.
We require coursework in molecular-cellular, circuit-systems, and cognitive neuroscience, plus optional
computational neuroscience. We require laboratory rotations and thesis research, an Experimental Boot
Camp, and a new Quantitative Boot Camp that teaches programming, data analysis and statistics. Our core
competency classes introduce major experimental methods and train students in rigor and reproducibility,
experimental design, scientific and grant writing, scientific talk skills, and responsible conduct of research.
Seminar series, multi-lab research meetings and journal clubs, and an annual campus-wide retreat provide
rich exposure to neuroscience research. A qualifying exam includes an NIH grant-style proposal for thesis
research, oral defense of the proposal, and examination on a broad set of foundational questions in
neuroscience. Students complete an individual development plan (IDP) at the end of Year 2.
 A multi-tiered advising system provides extensive scientific and career advising. We strive to provide
an inclusive, supportive research climate. We conduct yearly program evaluations to guide improvements.
For this renewal, we add important updates—launching our Quantitative Boot Camp, adding more training in
experiment design and scientific rigor, reorganizing our advising structure to provide more active student
advising and support, adding required mentor training for NTP faculty, and expanding career development
resources. We believe this training program will produce scientists who will make important discoveries with
cutting-edge technology, and translate these discoveries into solutions for human neurological disease.
 This training program is followed not just by T32 students, but by all Neuroscience PhD program
students, and its activities are open to any neuroscience-oriented student at Berkeley. This gives the NTP
critical mass and broad impact, reaching a large number of students and synergizing neuroscience training
for students across many PhD programs."

Misshapen teeth are highly common in humans. In most instances, they are due to genetic mutations in genes
controlling the morphogenesis of teeth. This is the case for the Runx2 gene, which once mutated leads to
cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) an autosomal dominant genetic syndrome presenting with peg-like teeth in
humans. While many factors have been identified in the process of tooth morphogenesis, currently, little is known
about how cell signaling participates in establishing organ shape during odontogenesis. Our previous work has
identified the signaling molecule retinoic acid (RA) to be one of the main actors of tooth induction in fish and
recent data suggest that RA also plays a role during tooth morphogenesis. Fish and zebrafish, in particular, are
good models to study genetics, cell and molecular biology, and organogenesis of the tooth in vertebrates. The
objective of the proposed studies is to understand the roles played by retinoic acid during tooth morphogenesis
in different fish species, to develop a fish model of CCD, to clarify the role played by Runx2 during tooth
morphogenesis, and to understand its link with RA signaling. Finally, this project proposes to identify novel genes
implicated in tooth morphogenesis and to study their function by gene knock-outs in zebrafish.
By exposing fish embryos and larvae to exogenous RA and RA inhibitor during tooth morphogenesis we will be
able to understand the mechanism of action of RA signaling during tooth morphogenesis in fish. Our preliminary
data identified that the levels of RA in different cells of the tooth germ are controlled by the timing and level of
expression of the RA degrading enzyme cyp26b1 in a subset of cells of the developing tooth germ. Modifying
the onset of cyp26b1 expression in the tooth germ will, therefore, change the level of RA available in the tooth
germ ultimately modifying the shape of the tooth. We will study the cis-regulatory changes responsible for
evolutionary changes in the timing of cyp26b1 expression during tooth morphogenesis between two closely
related fish species, the zebrafish and the mountain minnow, that bear dramatically different shape of teeth in
adults and during embryonic development. We have in hands the zebrafish runx2b (the zebrafish ortholog of the
human Runx2 gene that is expressed in the tooth germ) loss-of-function mutant. This mutant will be used to
perform a phenotypic analysis of tooth morphogenesis and to understand the relationship between RA signaling
and Runx2 expression during tooth morphogenesis. To identify novels genes playing a role during tooth
morphogenesis, we will select by cell sorting, tooth germ cells exposed to exogenous RA signaling and compare
their transcriptome to control developing tooth cells at the same developmental stage. The resulting genes
differentially expressed will be subjected to phenotypic analysis by gene knock-out using the CRISPR/cas9
technology. This work will reveal more about how RA and genes it regulates, including Runx2, controls tooth
morphogenesis in development, diseases (cleidocranial dysplasia) and evolution."

The stoichiometric cis association of the tetraspanin CD151 with podocyte integrin α3β1 is essential for stabilizing
α3β1 in an active ligand-binding conformation, thus maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier
(GFB). Other studies also show that activation of αvβ3 in podocytes by inflammatory mediators, growth factors
or mechanical/shear stress plays a critical role in disrupting the GFB. Taken together, these data suggest that
α3β1 and αvβ3 play opposing roles in regulating GFB homeostasis, but the biochemical and structural basis of
this functional antagonism in disease is unknown and how the glomerulus responds to injury in the complete
absence or inactivation of podocyte αvβ3 remains to be clarified. In preliminary studies, we show that αvβ3
ectodomain binds CD151 with similar EC50 to α3β1, that this interaction requires the active conformation of αvβ3
and is promoted by the αvβ3 inhibitors used in prior studies acting as partial agonists. These data lead us to
propose and test the hypothesis that activation of αvβ3 in disease states sequesters CD151 away from binding
to α3β1, thus impairing optimal α3β1 function and disrupting the GFB. In other preliminary studies, we
demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining a cryo-EM structure of an integrin in an inactive conformation in complex
with a tetraspanin, providing the feasibility for determining the structural basis of the active integrin conformation
that forms the complex with CD151. We have also generated mice with podocyte specific deletion of αv and
developed a novel class of αvβ3 inhibitors that are not partial agonists and that prevent rather than promote
αvβ3/CD151 association, which will also allow us to examine the glomerular response to injury when αvβ3 is
inactivated genetically or pharmacologically in rodent models of proteinuric kidney disease."

The purpose of this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to provide Alvaro
Moreira, MD, MSc, Assistant Professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio with the
knowledge and skills requisite to develop into an independent academic physician scientist. His long-term career
goal is to understand the pathologic processes that correlate with the development of bronchopulmonary
dysplasia (BPD), a disease with high morbidity and mortality in premature neonates. To this avail, Dr. Moreira is
incorporating the use of high-fidelity technology to validate two genomic signatures (n=20 genes) that he and his
mentoring team have identified as strong predictors for BPD susceptibility. To achieve this goal, Dr. Moreira and
his mentoring team have devised a comprehensive plan based on: (1) an in-depth hands on training in genomics
and bioinformatics; (2) didactic and experiential instruction in advanced immunology, and (3) rigorous training in
clinical trials. This platform will provide the basis for Dr. Moreira to gain the skills, knowledge and experience
needed to formulate and test incisive hypotheses that will bolster advances in neonatal lung disease. Neonates
diagnosed with BPD are at increased risk for systemic (blindness, mental deficiency) and site-specific
complications (asthma, recurrent respiratory infections, pulmonary hypertension). BPD is characterized by an
aberrant lung development secondary to chronic exposure to hyperoxia and ventilator-induced injury. Despite
advances in neonatal medicine, current therapies are limited and largely ineffective. Thus, there is an urgency
to adopt novel tactics to mitigate and prevent BPD. Significant gaps in understanding the underlying mechanisms
in BPD are attributed to an operational definition, a lack of robust neonatal tissue biorepositories, and animal
models that do not recapitulate the intricacies of human physiology. Translational genomics holds significant
promise as an approach to overcome these barriers. Indeed, in a discovery cohort of 120 preterm neonates, Dr.
Moreira and his mentoring team have identified genomic signatures that predict BPD and stratifies BPD
endotypes in a neonate's first 5 days of life. In this revised application Dr. Moreira plans to validate two genomic
signatures in a large prospective preterm neonatal cohort (Year 1, 2). In Year 3, he will test the ability of a
customized genomic array, based on his signatures, to provide a quick and reliable BPD risk stratification.
Furthermore, Dr. Moreira's studies will evaluate the safety and efficacy of an FDA-approved biologic in a one of
a kind large animal model mimicking BPD. This monoclonal antibody targets a modifiable process found to be
highly predictive for BPD in his genomic profile from the discovery cohort. Dr. Moreira's K23 studies will produce
a rich learning and educational framework directly informing his future R01 proposal aimed at primary prevention
strategies for BPD."
10827410,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glycoproteins and proteoglycans are important protein glycoconjugates in the cell. They can
control many biological events, such as growth factor signaling, cell adhesion, and differentiation,
to impact cancer biology, development, and immunity. While vital to human health and physiology,
we currently do not have a comprehensive molecular understanding of how these molecules
orchestrate their functions. Many techniques study these molecules in isolation – focusing on only
the protein or glycan component alone. This current approach severely underappreciates the
structural diversity of protein glycoconjugates, and it has left us with a narrowed understanding of
how protein glycoforms can differentially regulate biology. Furthermore, it has impeded pathways
to use glycoform-dependent interactions for drug discovery. Our research program integrates
techniques in chemical biology, molecular biology, and protein engineering, in order to address
these gaps. In this application, we describe our plans to create defined semi-synthetic
glycoproteins and proteoglycans, and to use these materials to study their interactions in live cells.
Identifying the glycoproteins associated with glycan-binding proteins allows the use of targeted
genetic approaches to study their functional contributions. The insights developed from these
studies will create an opportunity to discover small molecules that can selectively modulate
glycan-binding protein and glycoprotein interactions in order to regulate important biological
events."
10830322,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common childhood-onset motor disability, affecting 764,000 individuals
in the United States alone. The lifetime medical costs for a single individual with CP are estimated at $1.4M,
which represents a substantial healthcare and economic impact. A diverse set of risk factors contributes to CP,
including prematurity, intrauterine infection, and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. In approximately 20% of
cases, there are no clear perinatal risk factors (“cryptogenic CP”). There is accumulating evidence from rare
familial cases and a growing number of isolated cases suggesting that cryptogenic CP may result in part from
single gene disorders, including over 50 treatable inborn errors of metabolism. However, these studies have
involved small numbers of participants, with patient populations characterized using administrative data with
limited attention to precise clinical characterization. The full breadth of the genetic landscape of CP is
unknown.
 We hypothesize that a substantial portion of individuals with cryptogenic CP will have a pathogenic or
likely pathogenic variant in a single gene providing an explanation for their symptoms. We propose rigorously
phenotyping a large prospective cohort of individuals with both cryptogenic and non-cryptogenic CP who have
undergone exome sequencing through an institutional genomics pilot study, and then analyzing exome
sequencing data to determine the presence of single gene disorders in each subgroup.
 To accomplish these goals, we will classify patients as cryptogenic CP or non-cryptogenic CP. We will
systematically, rigorously, and longitudinally characterize neurological, motor, communication, and
neuroimaging phenotypes using research measures validated for CP. Next, we will analyze exome data using
an institutional pipeline for variant interpretation. Finally, we will build a statistical model that correlates the
presence of a genetic disorder with phenotypic measures in order to help predict which individuals with CP are
most likely to have a single gene disorder.
 If applied to the population at large, the proposed work could lead to identification of single gene
disorders in thousands of individuals with CP, including treatable conditions where a molecular diagnosis may
positively alter a child's developmental trajectory. Determining etiology represents a first step in understanding
the biological substrates of CP needed for developing rational therapeutics for this highly prevalent condition."

10874385,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant public health burden and remains the leading cause of mortality
among the U.S population. CVD progression can originate during childhood, and youth with overweight and
obesity (OW/OB) have an increased risk for CVD development. One mechanism that contributes to the
development of CVD is imbalanced cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. The cardiac ANS governs
the heart’s response to everyday conditions via sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation, in which balance
of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems indicates healthy cardiac ANS function. However, youth with
OW/OB present overactivation of the sympathetic modulation of the heart, which is strongly associated with
several adverse health outcomes.
Studies in youth demonstrated that increased sedentary time (ST) is related to higher CVD risk. However, it is
unknown whether the associations between ST and CVD are due to time displaced from physical activity to ST
or due to underlying physiological processes stimulated by ST. Reduced cardiac ANS balance may be mediating
the ST and CVD risk association, but few researchers have examined the associations between ST and cardiac
ANS function, and none have examined associations within a day or within a person, and have not experimentally
manipulated prolonged ST. Understanding the relationship of ST to cardiac ANS function may provide insight
toward methodologies to alleviate CVD development, especially in youth with OW/OB who are at significantly
higher risk for CVD.
This project aims to leverage data collection opportunities from the NIH-funded Sedentary Breaks Study 3 (P.I.
Dr. Britni Belcher; R01DK12333) to elucidate observational and experimental relationships between ST and
cardiac ANS function via measures of heart rate variability in youth with OW/OB. The first phase of this project
will investigate daily associations between objectively-measured ST and cardiac ANS function under habitual
conditions. In the second phase, this project will have an innovative experimental component to determine the
acute effects of interrupting ST on cardiac ANS function in-lab over seven consecutive days among three
conditions: 1) continuous sitting (SIT), 2) sitting interrupted by 3-minute bouts of moderate-intensity walking every
30 minutes (SIT+WALK), and 3) sitting interrupted by a single 18-minute bout of moderate-intensity walking (EX)."
10918053,"Project Summary: Uterine serous carcinomas (USC), uterine carcinosarcomas (UCS), and leiomyosarcomas
represent the most aggressive subtypes of uterine cancer and account for a disproportionate number of uterine
cancer related deaths in the United States. The lethality of these high-grade uterine cancers is largely due to the
propensity of these cancers to disseminate and metastasize, leaving patients with a lack of effective treatment
options. Despite this, the molecular drivers of the metastatic potential of these disease subtypes remain
incompletely understood.
 Previous work by our group and others have identified a recurrent mutational hotspot within the gene
encoding for the A scaffolding subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), PPP2R1A. These mutations,
P179R and S256F, occur exclusively within these high-grade subtypes of uterine cancer and are not found in
any other cancer type. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is a family of serine/threonine phosphatases, where the
active heterotrimeric form is comprised of the catalytic (C) subunit, the scaffolding (A) subunit, and a substrate
directing regulatory (B) subunit. In aggregate, PP2A is considered a tumor suppressor protein, but certain
heterotrimers have tumor promoting roles. We have shown that these mutations contribute to uterine cancer
tumorigenesis by modulating PP2A function in a manner that impairs the formation of tumor suppressive
heterotrimers, while leaving tumor promoting heterotrimeric complexes intact.
 My preliminary data show that the PP2A P179R and S256F mutations enhance tumor initiating capacity,
and the ability to form 3D tumor spheres in vitro. Importantly, uterine cancer cells expressing these mutations
also form intraperitoneal nodules at an increased rate in vivo, suggesting that these mutations may enhance the
establishment of new tumor formation in the peritoneal cavity. Conditioned media from the mutant expressing
uterine cancer cells promoted tumor sphere formation of WT expressing uterine cancer cell growth, indicating
that the mutant cells may create a more permissive tumor microenvironment for tumor formation. Preliminary
data suggests that the mutant cells have increased -catenin phosphorylation and WNT ligand expression.
 The working hypothesis of this proposal is that the recurrent mutants, P179R and S256F, enhance uterine
cancer metastasis through increased WNT signaling and secretion of WNT ligands. To test this hypothesis, we
will develop PP2A A knock-in xenograft models to determine how these recurrent mutants contribute to
enhanced metastasis in vivo (Specific Aim 1). Second, mechanistic studies will explore the secreted factors from
the mutant uterine cancer cells, exploring WNT ligands, coupled with secretome analysis. These studies will also
explore the link between loss of PP2A and WNT mediated EMT (Specific Aim 2). This proposal aims to decipher
the functional role of recurrent PP2A A𝛼 mutations on uterine cancer metastasis, which may identify a new
therapeutic target(s) of high-grade uterine cancers."

THE IMPACT OF EXEMPTING MEDICAL PROVIDERS FROM MALPRACTICE LIABILITY
Among the most controversial aspects of the U.S. health care system are the impacts of the medical
malpractice system on patient treatments and health care costs. Defensive medicine is an unintended effect of
the liability system in which physicians order extraneous tests, procedures and other services as a result of
fears over medical liability. The debate continues, however, regarding just how large these costs really are.
Missing from the literature's attempts to resolve this debate has been a true “treatment” group of medical
encounters with respect to which there is no liability recourse at all in the event of negligent care. We aim to
further the analysis begun under R01AG049898, in which we drew on institutional features of the Military
Health System (MHS) to estimate the effects of immunizing providers from liability, facilitating an
unprecedented assessment of the full extent of defensive medicine operating in our system. We propose to
continue this research to push the literature beyond its present focus on inpatient care and to place the effects
of liability in perspective by comparing liability's effects with other approaches, especially demand-side
approaches, to regulating medical encounters. Our focus will be on investigating the impacts of certain policy
levers on age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer.
The proposed continuation will address four aims. First we will explore the impact of medical liability pressure
on “high-value” outpatient care, while placing these estimates into perspective by likewise exploring effects on
the receipt of “low-value” care (drawing on high- and low-value measures currently emphasized in the medical
literature). Second, drawing on a unique feature of the MHS data, we propose to compare the effects on high-
and low-value care receipt stemming from the medical liability system – a classic supply-side approach to
regulating provider behavior – with those resulting from a classic demand-side approach to regulating the
physician-patient relationship: information disclosure to patients. Third, we will place independent emphasis on
one of the key dimensions of comparison necessary to execute the liability analysis – that is, the difference in
quality and quantity of care provided on the base through a coordinated direct-delivery system with that
provided off the base through the MHS's purchased-care system. Fourth, we will explore aspects of each of
the above aims specifically in the context of opioid use among the MHS population, while comparing the
effects of liability pressure and information disclosure on opioid use with the effects of one of the most oft-
discussed stated-based approaches to regulating opioid use: Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs."

Research: SLE carries increased risks of multiple comorbidities and double the risk of death compared to the
general population. Current treatment is limited in part by few proven medications and adverse treatment
effects. The central goal of this research is to improve long-term SLE outcomes by integrating personalized
risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient-centered use
of key lupus medications. To achieve this goal, she will risk stratify patients for potential harms of treatment,
i.e., hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection with belimumab use versus other immunosuppressants, and
other adverse outcomes, i.e., severe COVID-19 infection (Aim 1). She will elicit patient preferences for SLE
treatment through a discrete choice experiment (Aim 2a) and will integrate patient preferences with
personalized risks through a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the optimal hydroxychloroquine dose
in SLE care (Aim 2b). Completion of this proposal and training plan will position Dr. Jorge with the vital

10839810,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the United States that affects more
than 5 million Americans. Synapses are the earliest affected component of the brain during AD pathogenesis,
suggesting that the cognitive decline and neuronal loss in AD initiates with synaptic dysfunction. Despite much
effort, however, no definitive understanding of AD pathogenesis is available, and no therapies that alleviate or
even stop progression of AD are known. Genetic studies identified rare mutations in presenilin and in APP genes
that cause early-onset familial AD (FAD), and described common variants in several genes, chiefly the ApoE
and TREM2 genes, that predispose to sporadic AD, providing potential clues to AD pathogenesis. Presenilin
mutations impair the activity of γ-secretase, an intramembranous protease that cleaves a large number of
membrane proteins, including APP. Presenilin and APP mutations associated with FAD both enhance production
of Aβ, a cleavage product of APP. Moreover, all AD patients suffer from an accumulation of Aβ in brain, leading
to the `amyloid Aβ hypothesis' whereby AD is induced by Aβ amyloid accumulation in brain. However, therapies
that prevent or even reverse Aβ accumulation in brain have not been effective in treating AD. Furthermore, ApoE
and TREM2 are not directly related to Aβ, but seem to influence microglial function, inflammatory responses,
and/or lipid metabolism. Indeed, alterations in lipid content are a prominent feature of AD brains, suggesting that
Aβ may be related to AD pathogenesis in a manner that is not related to amyloid formation. Indeed, in preliminary
experiments we observed that a chronic decrease γ-secretase activity, as would be observed with FAD-
associated mutations of presenilin genes, causes a major decrease in synaptic transmission and an upregulation
of cholesterol synthesis. Based on the all of these findings together, we here propose an interdisciplinary project
that examines the role of changes in γ-secretase activity in synaptic function and lipid metabolism as a potential
pathogenetic mechanism in AD. We describe four specific aims that will investigate the relationship of γ-
secretase to synaptic transmission, the mechanism by which γ-secretase activity normally suppresses
cholesterol synthesis, and the possibility that increased cholesterol synthesis induced by a chronic decrease in
γ-secretase activity is responsible for the observed synaptic impairments. Moreover, the proposed specific aims
will explore the possibility that ApoE4, the ApoE variant predisposing to AD, also acts by altering lipid metabolism
in neurons. These experiments will adopt a multidisciplinary approach that will be carried out in human neurons
and in mouse brains, and will combine cell biology, transcriptomics, CRISPR, and electrophysiology techniques
to explore the underlying mechanisms. Among others, these experiments will contribute to our understanding of
how presenilin mutations that cause FAD and impair γ-secretase activity affect synapses, and test the overall
hypothesis that FAD-associated presenilin mutations and genetic ApoE variants predisposing to sporadic AD act
by a sucommon pathway regulating neuronal cholesterol levels, which in turn influences synaptic function."
10802361,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cardiovascular disease associated with myocardial infarction (MI) remains a major cause of death
worldwide. Cell reprogramming into cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs), bypassing the process of
pluripotency induction, has provided a promising approach for cardiac repair through simultaneous
neovascularization and cardiomyogenesis. One significant gap in current research is an unclear
understanding of the mechanisms of direct reprogramming. The activation of endogenous genetic loci
(that are occluded by repressive chromatin marks) in starting cells has been considered an important
criterion of high-quality fully reprogrammed cells. Therefore, we attempt to obtain a new source of CPCs
through direct manipulation of endogenous genes. To this end, we propose a combined use of
reprogramming technologies and CRISPR-based tools. CRISPR-induced gene activation is superior to
conventional techniques employing cDNA overexpression due to its effectiveness, simplicity of design
and avoidance of the need for additional transduction of transcription factor complexes. Our preliminary
data demonstrates that CRISPR-induced cells possess the properties of CPCs including clonality, self-
renewal, and cardiac tri-potentiality. Importantly, the CRISPR-induced CPCs (iCPCs) can blunt the
worsening of heart function and reduce infarct size after transplantation in MI mice. These findings are
the basis for a further systematic investigation of CRISPR-iCPCs in a preclinical setting. Accordingly,
three Specific Aims are proposed to develop a technical platform to generate new CRISPR-iCPCs, study
cell-reprogramming mechanisms, and evaluate the application of iCPCs for MI therapy. In Aim-1, a new
non-viral CRISPR system will be developed for generation of iCPCs using a clinically acceptable gene
vector system and the biological and functional features of new iCPCs will be characterized. In Aim-2,
epigenetic factors mediating iCPC generation will be the focus of experiments. Long non-coding RNAs
and targeted epigenetic mediators will be investigated to dissect the mechanisms of cellular
reprogramming. In Aim-3, iCPCs will be implanted using cell patch techniques, and their cell fate
decisions will be tracked in the infarcted heart. The extent and role of differentiated iCPCs will be
determined by in vivo imaging and distinguished from other consequences using a cell ablation approach.
In conclusion, this proposal will provide a new regeneration strategy for MI therapy through convergence
of CRISPR technology and tissue engineering in CPC development."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological condition affecting up to 1% of older adults, over 90% of
whom experience speech problems. These speech problems cause reductions in quality of life, as measured by
patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) of communicative participation, speech intelligibility, and naturalness, with
further declines as the disease progresses. Decrements in PCOs can be attributed to changes in underlying
physiological mechanisms of speech (i.e., the respiratory, laryngeal, and articulatory subsystems), yet the
relative contributions of changes in speech physiology to PCOs are unknown. Without this knowledge, precious
therapy time may be wasted on addressing physiological changes that do not matter to the patient experience.
Defining the relationships between speech physiology and PCOs would allow clinicians to focus on physiological
changes that are important to the patient. Furthermore, since many clinical settings do not have the resources
to implement physiological measures, research is needed to determine which clinically accessible acoustic
assessments are related to the individualized changes in speech physiology that drive changes in PCOs. We
propose a comprehensive, longitudinal study of PCOs, physiology, and acoustics in a large sample, which
should provide novel outcomes for clinical translation. In Aim 1, we will compare longitudinal changes in PCOs
in PD to concomitant changes in speech physiology. Regardless of whether we see group-level changes, this
aim will provide physiological targets that are tied to PCOs in the individuals who decline during the study period.
In Aim 2, we will develop and evaluate a refined set of acoustic correlates of speech decline in PD based on
their relationships with respiratory, laryngeal, and articulatory physiology. Finally, in Aim 3, we will
psychometrically assess the sensitivity to change of the measures of speech physiology and the acoustic
correlates. The ability of a measure to appropriately reflect change over time is a critical characteristic, essential
for measures to be used for clinical or research applications. To comprehensively assess sensitivity to change,
we will examine both decreasing (due to disease progression) and increasing (due to improvement with
behavioral cueing – clear speech) function. Our results will provide a roadmap for future evidence-based
treatment. Based on a physiological or acoustic evaluation, clinicians will be able to target specific speech
subsystems to improve PCOs. This work will guide the future development of personalized treatment for
individuals with PD."
10831826,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hoarding disorder (HD) is a debilitating neuropsychiatric and public health problem that affects up to 4% of the
general population and 6% of older adults. Despite formal recognition as an independent diagnosis in the fifth
edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, HD remains frequently underdiagnosed and
effective treatment is limited. To date, multiple challenges have precluded the development of effective HD
detection and intervention efforts, including problems arising from wide-ranging heterogeneity in HD symptom
presentation. Efforts to better understand this heterogeneity are lacking, though evidence from other psychiatric
disorders indicates extensive utility in identifying dimensional symptom subgroups defined by distinct risk factors
and requiring unique prevention and intervention needs. The identification of common symptom patterns may
improve our ability to detect clinically meaningful hoarding behaviors and quickly navigate patients to
personalized treatment. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to distinguish heterogeneity in HD
symptomatology, through which I will establish unique profiles of HD symptoms and assess the utility of symptom
subgroups for elucidating variability in disorder etiology and longitudinal course. I will achieve this goal through
three specific aims. First, I will identify and characterize HD subgroups on the basis of symptom profile and
clutter-related functional impairment and safety concerns. In this aim, I will conduct data-driven analyses using
self-report symptom data collected from more than 35,500 individuals who have completed assessments of
hoarding and clutter in the Brain Health Registry (BHR), an internet-based research registry of adult participants
who semi-annually complete comprehensive self-report assessments of health history and behavior. This rich,
epidemiologic data source allows for comprehensive and innovative investigation of HD on a population-level.
Second, I will investigate variation in HD etiology following classification of subjects into hoarding symptom
subgroups. In this aim, I will employ a social-ecological framework for quantifying subgroup diversity in
intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community-level risk factors for HD. Finally, I will assess the differential impact
of HD subgroups on the longitudinal course of hoarding symptom severity. In this aim, linear mixed-effects
models will be used to assess the predictive ability of HD subgroups for distinguishing symptom trajectory. This
work will enrich knowledge of symptom presentation in HD and its relationship to disorder etiology and
longitudinal symptom course, thus enhancing efforts to effectively identify and treat hoarding behavior, all the
while strengthening my technical and professional skills to support my ultimate career goal as an independent
investigator."
10766256,"Early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) facilitates early intervention, which improves lifelong
prognosis. Universal screening in the medical home during toddler check-ups is successful at detecting many
cases of ASD, yet uptake remains low, in part due to many barriers to successful ASD screening by
pediatricians, including limited time and resources during the well-child visits, and low confidence in the
screening process. In addition, underserved children from minority and low-income families are less likely to be
screened compared to their White and middle-class peers, exacerbating the known disparities in access to
early diagnosis and ASD intervention. The current proposal aims to expand beyond screening at pediatric well-
visits, by developing and evaluating novel strategies to successfully screen for ASD in childcare centers, where
many children spend more than 30 hours per week. Although there have been screening studies conducted in
childcare centers, the feasibility of routinely using this alternate setting has not been widely addressed yet, and
preliminary findings indicate that primary care strategies are not acceptable in childcare settings. Early
Childhood Education Providers (ECEPs) have extensive exposure to normative child behavior and many hours
of engagement with children, including many in underserved communities, enrolled in childcare. Thus,
engagement of ECEPs in toddler screening could present an opportunity for significant improvement in ASD
early identification and reduction of disparities in age of diagnosis and early treatment. However, there are
existing barriers to autism screening in childcare centers, including low parental acceptance, which is critical to
identify and address. Therefore, the goal of this pilot study is to explore barriers and facilitators of systematic
screening by ECEPs, including cultural hesitancy, and using the strategies identified, examine the performance
of the illustrated Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, Revised, with Follow-Up (M-CHAT-R/F) paired with
the Ages and Stages Questionnaires in childcare centers. The specific aims are to: (1) utilize qualitative
methods (field observations and semi-structured interviews) with ECEPs to investigate organizational barriers
and facilitators for implementation of ASD screening in childcare setting, (2) utilize qualitative methods (semi-
structured interviews) with disadvantaged parents of children attending childcare centers to investigate familial
and cultural barriers and facilitators for parent engagement in screening for ASD in childcare centers serving
underserved families, and (3) pilot novel strategies for ASD screening in childcare centers, informed by the
qualitative findings, to evaluate agreement between parents and ECEPs, accuracy of childcare screening, and
acceptability of ASD screening in childcare centers. Results of this proposed study will directly address a gap
in universal ASD screening, particularly for underserved families. Screening in childcare centers provides a
complementary strategy to existing screening at pediatric well-visits, which will improve access of children from
all backgrounds to early interventions and supports, critical for improved outcomes."
10758629,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects one to two percent of the population over age 60. Many treatments
are costly, and while they temporarily alleviate symptoms, none currently available slow progression.
Therefore, understanding the mechanistic basis of PD is critical to inform both preventive and therapeutic
efforts. Environmental factors are important contributors to PD, and laboratory, clinical, and
epidemiological studies have demonstrated a role for several specific chemical exposures. All of these
chemicals affect mitochondria. However, there is strong evidence for association with PD for only a few
chemicals, and because relatively few people are exposed to significant amounts of those chemicals,
they collectively likely explain only a small fraction of PD. Recent high-throughput toxicological screens
have demonstrated that hundreds if not thousands of chemicals in commerce cause mitochondrial
dysfunction and toxicity. It is not possible to test all of these thoroughly, and yet regulatory action requires
clear toxicological data. How can we rationally prioritize these chemicals for testing?
 A way forward is suggested by the fact that although these chemicals are all mitotoxicants, they
have multiple mechanisms of toxicity. These include inhibition of all four electron chain complexes, ATP
synthase, and Krebs cycle enzymes; redox cycling; mitochondrial DNA damage; and uncoupling of ATP
production from oxygen consumption. We propose to narrow the focus of efforts to identify
chemicals that could contribute to PD, by clarifying which of the many mechanisms by which
chemicals cause “mitochondrial dysfunction” can contribute to dopaminergic neurodegeneration.
We will define which specific forms of mitochondrial dysfunction result in dopaminergic
neurodegeneration. We will also test whether key downstream outcomes, oxidative stress and ATP
depletion, are required for dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This additional layer of mechanistic
understanding lends itself to high-throughput screening, and may be informative for therapeutic efforts.
We will test the causality of specific forms of mitochondrial dysfunction by using pollutants that act by
different mitotoxic mechanisms; by comparing the timeline of energetic and oxidative stress changes with
neurodegeneration; and by rescue experiments. In order to examine this large number of exposures in an
in vivo, yet rigorous and highly replicated fashion, we will work in the model organism Caenorhabditis
elegans. We are developing novel strains of C. elegans that will permit us to carry out aging-related, in
vivo assessments of cell type-specific changes to all of these parameters, in the same individuals.
 Overall, results from this work will serve to mechanistically delimit the landscape of chemical
exposures that could contribute to PD, guiding regulatory guideline development as well as justifying
additional future research in vertebrate models and epidemiological studies."
10930803,"Project Summary
Simultaneous use of alcohol and marijuana/cannabis (SAM) leads to increased craving, use, and
consequences compared to single use of either alcohol or cannabis. However, there is a dearth of knowledge
regarding the neural, neuroendocrine, and behavioral differences in SAM users that increases risk for these
negative outcomes. The current proposal aims to address this significant gap in knowledge by examining how
stress related neural and neuroendocrine processes may differ in SAM users relative to single substance users
or a control group. A sex-balanced sample of four hundred forty male and female individuals reporting SAM
use, alcohol use only, cannabis use only, or neither binge/heavy alcohol use nor cannabis use will be recruited
to complete a neuroimaging session and three 14-day bursts of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) over
the course of one year. During the neuroimaging session, participants will complete a stress cue reactivity task
while undergoing fMRI and will also have blood drawn to assess stress-induced cortisol response. Participants
will complete a baseline EMA burst that focuses on daily experiences of stress, craving and drug use, and will
complete follow-up bursts at 6- and 12-months post-baseline. This proposal aims to better understand how
stress processes are related to increased risk among SAM users. Specifically this proposal will investigate 1)
how neural and neuroendocrine responses to stress are moderated by group (i.e., SAM, alcohol-only,
cannabis-only, control), sex, and the interaction of group x sex; 2) how group, sex, and group x sex
interactions, and neural/ neuroendocrine responses moderate the momentary relationships between stress and
craving/use in daily life; and 3) how group, sex, and group x sex interactions, and neural/neuroendocrine
responses moderate the trajectory of craving/use over a one-year follow-up period. Broadly, we expect that
while single substance users will have some dysregulation, SAM users will exhibit the greatest stress
dysregulation relative to controls, and females (vs. males) will demonstrate greater dysregulation of
neural/neuroendocrine responses to stress, greater momentary relationships between stress and craving/use,
and steeper trajectories of craving/use. Successful completion of these aims will significantly advance our
understanding of the mechanisms by which SAM use increase risk for substance use disorders and other
negative outcomes, which will be key in guiding future intervention and prevention efforts."
10757725,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This proposal is significant because we aim to study the cellular mechanisms that regulate the
increased risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) development in Black women. This is important
because BCRL is a highly morbid disease that causes chronic and progressive arm swelling. Patients who
develop BRCL have diminished quality of life, require life-long care with compression garments, and can
develop recurrent infections that require hospitalization. Due to the high prevalence of breast cancer, BCRL is
the most common form of lymphedema in developed countries, afflicting 20–35% of women who undergo
axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).
 To identify risk factors for BCRL, our group has prospectively followed 276 women with arm
measurements before and after ALND for 2 years. We have found that Black women have the highest risk of
BCRL even after adjusting for confounding variables. In our study, Black race increased the risk of BCRL
development by >3.6 fold compared with White race. These findings are supported by two other published
studies reporting increased risk of BCRL development in Black women who undergo ALND for breast cancer.
Thus, while there is strong evidence that Black women have a significantly increased risk of developing BCRL,
the cellular mechanisms that regulate this risk remain unknown. This gap in our knowledge is important and a
major barrier to developing novel therapies that prevent or treat lymphedema in this patient population. In
addition, understanding how Black race increases the risk of BCRL may shed light on the mechanisms that
regulate the pathophysiology of this disease in general. Based on prior research and our preliminary studies,
our central hypothesis is that Black women have an increased risk of developing BCRL due to a baseline
increased propensity for inflammation and fibrosis. We propose to test this hypothesis using two Specific Aims.
In Aim 1, we will analyze how racial disparities modulate inflammatory responses following lymphatic injury.
This hypothesis is based on the finding that the pathophysiology of lymphedema is linked to chronic
inflammation and development of T-helper 2 (Th2)-biased immune responses. Black patients have a
propensity for inflammation in other pathological settings, suggesting that these differences may also
contribute to an increased risk for developing BCRL. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that Black women
have an increased fibrotic response to lymphedema. This hypothesis is based on the observation that fibrosis
is a key pathological feature of lymphedema and plays a major role in regulating lymphatic function. Black
individuals have an increased potential for fibrosis in a variety of pathological settings including inflammatory
skin disorders."

10786107,"Project Summary
 In 2020, approximately 1.6 million Americans were confirmed to have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
and it is expected that as many as 70,000 new cases of IBD are diagnosed in the United States each year. IBD
comprises of chronic, relapsing inflammatory disorders affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, such as Crohn’s
Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Among various immune cells that participate in IBD, neutrophils are not only the
first responder cell-type to inflammation, but also involved in limiting inflammation and facilitating wound repair.
Of note, there is a dearth of literature on the mucoprotective role of the enzyme peptidyl arginine deiminase-4
(PAD4), whose predominant function is to facilitate the generation of citrullinated histone 3 (H3Cit) and the
release of DNA as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The overall goal of the research is to study the role
PAD4 in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This proposal aims to systematically elucidate the role of PAD4-
mediated release of H3Cit and NETs during IBD. Three specific aims are proposed, each of which investigates
the molecular underpinnings by which PAD4 influence gut health and disease. The three aims are interrelated,
independently achievable and would systematically characterize: (i) the role of NETs in murine models of IBD,
(ii) the adverse consequence of PAD4-deficiency in potentiating the ‘spillover’ of neutrophil granule proteins and
(iii) the significance of NETs in preventing bacterial encroachment on the mucosa, that otherwise can perpetuate
intestinal inflammation."
10804739,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Animals respond to changes in their external environment and promote pro-survival behavioral output. Shifts in
an animal’s internal state, or a shift neuronal processing mediated through neuromodulation, drive these adaptive
behavioral responses, affecting sensory and memory processing. State-dependent modulation can be harmful
when it is related to drugs of abuse, particularly alcohol. This project aims to understand the mechanisms and
circuit motifs that mediate state-dependent modulation of alcohol memory circuits. Understanding these circuit
mechanisms will highlight how internal state, brought about by stress, mood, and physiological state, can affect
drug abuse disorders, cravings, and relapse. Briefly, Drosophila melanogaster were conditioned with a spaced-
training paradigm to associate an odor cue with an intoxicating dose of alcohol, and preference was tested the
following day. Octopaminergic neurons, the invertebrate equivalent norepinephrine, were found to modulate
olfactory reward memory circuits necessary for alcohol memory acquisition and retrieval in fruit flies.
Thermogenetic inhibition of octopaminergic neurons showed that modulation occurred only when flies were in a
food-deprived state, and this neuromodulation was necessary for the acquisition and retrieval of the alcohol
memory. In-vivo calcium imaging will be used to assess the activity of the subset of octopamine neurons
mediating this state-dependent modulation (satiated versus food-deprived states) and their downstream post-
synaptic partners. Neuronal activity of the identified state-dependent octopaminergic circuit will be assessed
during intoxication, naïve odor exposure, odor-alcohol pairings, and paired- or unpaired-odor re-cue. These
experiments will highlight state-dependent mechanisms for memory processing, by which shifts in internal state
can affect the acquisition and retrieval of memories related to drugs of abuse. The applicant will acquire training
in calcium imaging and sophisticated data-analysis methods to follow-through on these experiments, with
ongoing professional development training to help develop the applicant for the next stage of their career as a
postdoctoral researcher. The applicant will continue to pursue mechanisms of state-dependent modulation and
how that affects multi-sensory integration, to drive behavioral choices. In the postdoctoral phase, the applicant
will gain proficiency in calcium imaging techniques, computational skills, and continued training in analytical
methods to examine large-scale calcium imaging data sets. Additionally, the applicant will further their
professional development and grow towards becoming an independent researcher at an academic institution."

10710184,"The craniofacial skeleton of vertebrates develops under the guidance of highly
conserved gene regulatory networks active in cranial neural crest cells. Alterations to these
networks can lead to numerous human disorders such as cleft palate, premature closing of the
skull, and reduced teeth size. Laboratory studies of traditional animal models have contributed
to our understanding of the functional role of the core gene networks but have largely involved
significant gene modifications through induced mutations. As such, these systems may be less
fruitful for discovering how craniofacial gene networks adapt to gene loss and unique
morphologies because the abrogation of gene function can have a significant systemic effect. A
complementary approach is the study of evolutionary mutant models with adaptations that
recapitulate human diseases with similar altered morphology and/or gene changes. Variation
that is detrimental in humans may be neutral or even beneficial in evolutionary mutant models,
therefore allowing the study of gene regulatory networks in the context of normal organismal
function. Previously, limited genetic tools necessitated examining craniofacial models in select
animal models. Recent advances in sequencing (e.g. single cell) and functional (e.g. CRISPR)
technologies enable fruitful studies in less traditional species. By integrating single cell analysis,
whole genome comparisons, and functional assays, gene regulatory networks can be
successfully compared across species. My project will evaluate craniofacial gene network
conservation and malleability through cross species comparisons and studies of syngnathid
fishes (pipefish, seahorses, and seadragons). These amazing fish have elongated ethmoid
bones, altered hyoids, and a complete loss of teeth. In addition, we recently discovered that
syngnathids have lost key craniofacial developmental genes (fgf3 and fgf4) that we hypothesize
has led to rewiring of craniofacial gene regulatory networks. First, I will complete single cell
sequencing to capture the RNA and chromatin accessibility of cells in zebrafish and stickleback
(fish models with ‘normal’ craniofacial features), and pipefish (evolutionary mutant model).
Second, I will build whole genome alignments of these fish and 13 other vertebrates to identify
regulatory elements. Third, I will functionally test five identified regulatory elements using
zebrafish. These three approaches will reveal how well conserved craniofacial gene expression
patterns and sequences are across numerous species. In addition, genes and sequences
unique to syngnathids may play a role in adaptation to gene loss and produce altered faces, and
may identify novel genes and regulatory factors that can lead to human therapies."
10843740,"SUMMARY
Rett syndrome (RTT) (OMIM #312750) is a severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations
in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Although RTT patients suffer from many co-morbid phenotypes,
wake disordered breathing has a major negative impact quality of life and is associated with high mortality rate.
Evidence from mouse models of RTT suggest disordered breathing results in part from a disrupted ability to
regulate breathing in response to changes in tissue CO2/H+ (i.e., central chemoreflex). The retrotrapezoid
nucleus (RTN) is an important site of chemoreception, neurons and astrocytes in this region sense changes in
CO2/H+ to regulate breathing. Previous work identifies heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 channels as key determinants of
RTN astrocyte CO2/H+ chemosensitivity. However, homomeric Kir4.1 and heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 are
differentially CO2/H+ sensitive and regulate divergent astrocyte processes including membrane potential and
clearance of neuronally released extracellular K+, and it is not clear which of these mechanisms contributes to
RTN chemoreception and disordered breathing in RTT. Previous work from my sponsors group showed that
MeCP2 deficient mice have reduced levels of both Kir4.1 and 5.1 channels, diminished astrocytic Kir4.1
mediated currents and dysregulated extracellular K+. Preliminary data also show that global deletion of Kir4.1
from astrocytes blunts the ventilatory response to CO2, while re-expression of Kir4.1 specifically in RTN
astrocytes rescued this respiratory phenotype. Based on this, I hypothesize that MeCP2 deficiency results in
loss of Kir4.1/5.1 and compromised astrocyte chemoreception that contributes to disordered breathing in
RTT. To explore this possibility, I will test the following two Specific Aims: 1) Determine roles of astrocyte
Kir4.1 containing channels in RTN chemoreception in vitro; and 2) Identify differential roles of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1
channels in the control of breathing in RTT. Understanding how Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 contribute to RTN
chemoreception and disordered breathing may provide mechanistic insight for targeted treatment of disordered
breathing in RTT. This work will also provide valuable training opportunities in molecular, cellular and whole-
animal approaches that will prepare me for a successful future in science."
10745346,"The goal of this project is to gain a detailed mechanistic understanding of how nuclear-import receptors (NIRs) can prevent and reverse the cytoplasmic mislocalization and accumulation of insoluble protein aggregates of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of common neurodegenerative disorders. TDP-43 pathology is a hallmark of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but is also commonly found in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other AD-related dementias (ADRDs), marking it as a high priority target for therapy development. Our labs have discovered that 1) TDP-43 pathology is characterized by the co-aggregation of TDP-43 with FG nucleoporins (FG-Nups) in the cytoplasm, causing nucleocytoplasmic transport defects and 2) NIRs can reduce the aberrant phase transition of TDP-43 and other disease-causing RNA-binding proteins with prion-like domains. Our data demonstrate that specific NIRs can reverse the hallmarks of TDP-43 proteinopathy in cellular and animal models of FTD and ALS. Based on our findings, we propose a novel non-canonical role for NIRs as potent molecular chaperones that are recruited by FG-Nups into pathological TDP-43 aggregates, where they act to to reverse the aberrant phase transition and restore the normal nuclear localization and splicing functions of TDP-43, suggesting a promising new strategy for therapeutic intervention. To test this hypothesis, our team of experts in cellular and animal models of FTD (an ADRD) and ALS, as well as structural biology approaches, will use cutting edge in vitro and in vivo methods to gain a detailed mechanistic understanding of how NIRs restore solubility, nuclear localization and normal function of TDP-43; how NIRs reduce neurodegeneration; how NIR dysfunction contributes to human disease; and how we can use this knowledge of NIR functions to develop future therapeutic strategies for TDP-43 proteinopathies. Our specific aims are: (i) to determine how NIRs restore proper TDP-43 localization and reduce aberrant phase transition in vitro, using a combination of advanced neuronal cell culture models of FTD and ALS and biochemical characterization of TDP-43 liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and fibrillization, and rational protein engineering approaches to potentiate the chaperone activity of NIRs; and (ii) to identify how NIRs reduce TDP-43-dependent neurodegeneration in cellular and animal models in vivo, employing Drosophila, organotypic slice cultures and somatic brain transgenesis in TDP-43 proteinopathy mouse models, and clarifying the nature of NIR pathology in ALS and FTD (an ADRD) patient brain tissue. Successful outcome of this project will clarify the role of NIRs in regulating TDP-43 phase transition during pathogenesis and how this activity can restore normal localization and cellular function of TDP-43. This knowledge will be critical for developing new therapeutic strategies to target aberrant phase separation in ALS, FTD, and other devastating AD-related neurodegenerative disorders with TDP-43 proteinopathy."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disorder with urgent need for a medical cure. In order to
successfully ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis, a better understanding of fibrotic pathogenesis is vital.
Myofibroblasts are key fibrosis-effector cells. It has long been known that the response to changes in the
mechanical properties of the surrounding tissue/matrix, along with active TGF-β, are critical drivers of
myofibroblast differentiation. Although integrins and other receptors participate in cell-matrix interactions, the
specific mechanosensor driving myofibroblast differentiation has remained elusive. We have identified TRPV4
as the critical mechanosensor for driving both myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis in the lung. TRPV4 is a
stretch-activatable, plasma membrane cation channel in the transient receptor potential, vanilloid family
(TRPV4). Moreover, TRPV4 drives myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis at levels of matrix stiffness that are
directly biologically and clinically relevant to pulmonary disease. We have demonstrated TRPV4’s importance
to myofibroblast differentiation and experimental pulmonary fibrosis and human IPF. Our novel published and
preliminary data further suggests that TRPV4’s pro-fibrotic actions depend on its biochemical association with
cytosolic PI3Kγ via PI3kγ’s unique aminoterminal, non-catalytic domain, followed by the translocation of the
protein complex to the plasma membrane. Based on this data, we have formulated the novel hypothesis that
the TGFβ drives myofibroblast differentiation and pulmonary fibrosis by inducing the TRPV4-PI3Kγ
protein complex to translocate to the plasma membrane. Three coordinated specific aims with gain and
loss function experimental designs will determine the key TRPV4-PI3Kγ pathway interactions that drive
myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis. They will utilize gain and loss of function design in in silico, in vitro
and in vivo systems at the structural level, cellular level, and at the levels of established experimental murine
models, and in human disease. AIM 1 will precisely define the amino acid(s) interacting sites between TRPV4
and PI3Kγ, AIM 2 will determine the mechanism whereby TGFβ induces the translocation of TRPV4-PI3Kγ
complexes to the PM where they act to drive myofibroblast differentiation and AIM 3 will test the concept that
the aminoterminal domain of PI3Kγ is necessary and sufficient to drive pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. All key
findings will be validated in normal and IPF patient-derived cells and tissue. When complete, we will have a
detailed and comprehensive understanding of the precise mechanism by which the TRPV4-PI3Kγ axis
mediates pulmonary fibrosis. As several small molecule, selective inhibitors of both PI3Kγ and TRPV4 are in
various phases of development, the knowledge gained from this “proof of concept” study could rapidly translate
into novel therapeutic approaches for pulmonary fibrotic disorders."
10832603,"Tyrosine kinases are important regulators of growth, differentiation, and apoptosis in eukaryotic cells.
Inappropriate tyrosine kinase signaling is observed in many cancers and inflammatory diseases. This
project focuses on the structure, activity, and regulation of the Ack1 and Brk nonreceptor tyrosine kinases.
In collaboration with Dr. Frederic Geissmann and colleagues, we have discovered a series of loss-of-
function mutations in Ack1 and Brk in a cohort of patients with severe Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
(SLE). These are the first tyrosine kinase mutations found to be linked to this disease. Our preliminary work
shows that the mutations drastically decrease (or completely block) kinase activity, downstream signaling,
and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. We propose to conduct functional studies of the wild-type and mutant
forms of Ack1 and Brk in mammalian cells, including experiments in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-
derived macrophages from the lupus patients and their healthy relatives. We will carry out global screens of
substrate specificity to determine whether the mutations “rewire” cellular signaling networks. We will also
carry out mechanistic and structural studies on the purified mutant kinases, and test how they are coupled
to the cell surface receptor MerTK. The overall hypothesis is that Ack1 and Brk link recognition of
phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells to phagocytic engulfment. Regulation or tuning of this signaling
pathway could provide a new strategy for therapeutic approaches in autoimmune diseases."

 3 The overall goal of this project is to develop accurate and reliable prediction tools and pharmacological targets
4 for the prevention of rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Abnormal hemodynamic stress such as
 5 impingement flow with high wall shear and oscillating flow with low wall shear, is intimately linked with the growth
 6 and rupture of IAs. However, detailed mechanisms underlying weak IA walls are not yet defined due to (1) the
 7 absence of technologies for profiling the spatial distribution of gene expression of endothelial cells (ECs) induced
 8 by the complex hemodynamic flow stressors created in IAs, (2) difficulties in collecting sequential clinical images
 9 of growing IAs and acquiring human IA tissue samples to validate biologic mechanisms, and (3) the absence of
10 technologies allowing integration of the data from 3D multimodal techniques. To overcome these obstacles, we
11 have built a strong, multidisciplinary team and created a new experimental system that bridges human samples,
12 imaging, and dynamic modeling platforms. In this project, we challenge two fundamental questions regarding
13 hemodynamic stress and induced responses within the IAs. First, does complex abnormal hemodynamic stress
14 within human IAs induce abnormal regulation of EC signaling pathways? Second, what signaling pathways in
15 EC link unstable wall remodeling during IA growth and rupture? To address these questions, we have pioneered
16 a 3D Live EC Aneurysmal Flow Simulator (3D LEAFS) for profiling the spatial distribution of EC responses to
17 complex hemodynamic flow stress created in patient-specific IAs. Preliminary studies demonstrate that abnormal
18 flow in IAs induces abnormal EC morphology, cellular dysfunction and inflammation, and increased permeability.
19 We have developed an extensive database of clinical images of growing IAs and also tissue samples, exploiting
20 integrated flow analysis and 3D histological imaging of human IA tissue scanned with micro-CT and multiphoton
21 microscopy. With this database, we have linked abnormal flow with IAs to growth, wall thinning and weak wall
22 remodeling leading to rupture. By combining these state-of-the-art technologies, we propose to examine
23 fundamental impact of abnormal flow stress on ECs, and identify relationships between EC pathophysiological
24 responses and wall changes leading to fragile walls, growth and rupture. The proposed research is innovative
25 because this will be the first research to answer the above questions by utilizing multimodalities including
26 longitudinal follow-up images, surgical video, micro-CT, multiphoton microscopy, in vitro 3D endothelialized flow
27 simulator, and flow analysis for development of a pipeline for linking flow-induced EC responses to pathologic
28 changes in human IA tissue. The specific aims of this project are: 1) determine the EC signaling pathways
29 associated with unstable wall remodeling, 2) correlate pathological EC responses with IA growth, and 3)
30 determine the EC responses evoked by several characteristic abnormal hemodynamic flow conditions. The
31 proposed research will enhance development of precision medicine strategies that leverage diagnostic imaging
32 with risk prediction and translational therapies."
10788369,"Fluorescent Probes for Detection of Misfolded Protein Oligomers in Alzheimer's
 Disease and Related Disorder
 There is significant evidence that the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related disorders
are closely linked to the formation and proliferation of small oligomers that precede the emergence of the
prominent late-stage fibrils and plaques. Therefore, amyloid beta oligomers (AβOs) are the most direct
biomarkers for monitoring the onset and progression of AD. Attempts at utilizing this biomarker, however, have
been severely hampered by the dearth of techniques for the reliable detection of AβOs in biological samples and
tissues. While oligomer-selective antibodies have provided important insights into AβOs, their use doesn't extend
to detecting oligomer populations in vivo, let alone monitoring their temporal evolution. The overall objectives
of this proposal are therefore to identify small oligomer-selective dyes for the detection of AβOs and to validate
their specificity for AβOs, and potentially related oligomers, in tissues of animal models of AD and patient tissue.
 Multiple laboratories have observed that in vivo Aβ assembly displays not only purely sigmoidal but also
biphasic ThT kinetics. We have shown that the onset of biphasic ThT kinetics directly correlates with the onset
and rapid increase in prefibrillar oligomer populations with increases in monomer concentrations. Here we
propose to use this transition from essentially oligomer-free sigmoidal to oligomer-dominated biphasic kinetics
to screen a selection of readily available fluorescent dyes for their selectivity for AβOs over AβFs and monomers.
An initial test of this approach already yielded a highly promising dye candidate. Our preliminary data also
indicate that this dye specifically stains oligomer deposits in animal models of AD.
 While very encouraging, the utility of our current oligomer-selective dye requires further validation. In
addition, we seek to identify multiple chemically and structurally distinct oligomer-selective dyes to improve the
chances to develop one of them into a PET probe for in vivo imaging of oligomers. We will therefore extend our
current screen for AβO-selective dyes to a larger set of fluorescent dyes selected from different dye categories. In
parallel, we will scrutinize whether the current dye reliably detects AβOs at various stages of the disease, and
does so in animal models as well as patient tissues. Promising novel AβO-selective dyes identified through our
screening assay will be subjected to the same ex vivo validation of their specificity in tissues.
 We anticipate that these experiments will yield multiple promising AβO-selective dyes with application for
fundamental studies of oligomer formation, for the development of new assays for detecting AβOs ex vivo, and,
most importantly, as the detection moiety for a future oligomer-selective PET probe for antemortem in vivo
oligomer imaging in patients."
10830248,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
New strategies to targeted difficult-to-drug diseases such as cancers, neurodegeneration, and genetic disorders
are urgently needed. RNA manipulation is an emerging, therapeutically attractive paradigm which allows target
intervention orthogonal to drugging proteins and without the permanence of gene editing. A variety of tools for
RNA manipulation have been developed, but they rely on ribonuclear proteins, which are difficult to deliver in
vivo or are limited in scope of effect. This proposal aims to develop RNA-based bifunctional molecules (RBMs)
which will consist of an RNA oligonucleotide liked to a small molecule which recruits an effector protein, and will
enable modular, programmable targeting of RNA with a variety of manipulations. The proposed mechanism for
RBMs is based on small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides which are widely used as research tools and
have resulted in multiple approved therapeutics. In cells, siRNAs are loaded into Argonaute (AGO) proteins
which are part of the RNA silencing complex (RISC). AGO then guides RISC to mRNA targets complementary
to its loaded siRNA guide, which are cleaved upon binding, resulting in translational silencing. The
oligonucleotide portion of RBMs will function much like siRNAs but will feature key mismatches with the target
RNA. Such mismatches have been shown to oblate the cleavage activity of RISC while maintaining target
binding. Target binding will induce proximity between the target RNA and an effector protein recruited by the
small molecule ligand of the RBM, allowing the effector to act on the target. I will synthesize a small library of
RBMs with variable linker lengths and positions, and verify that they can interact with AGO and a model effector
protein in vitro (Aim 1). Next, I will use AGO pulldown to show that these interactions can be recapitulated in
cells, then use two model systems to show that RBMs can enable post-transcriptional control of mRNA targets
(Aim 2). Finally, I will show that RBMs targeting nuclear, long non-coding RNAs can enable control of gene
expression (Aim 3). Overall, this will create a platform in which the siRNA paradigm is expanded to enable a
much wider variety of manipulations, which will enable novel research tools and therapies.
 This project will use my existing skills in synthetic chemistry as a foundation and then allow me to branch out
in the field of chemical biology. The laboratory of my sponsor, Prof. Steven Banik, is a supportive research
environment which will enable me to successfully learn the new skills required to execute this proposal. Prof.
Banik is a member of Stanford's Chemistry Engineering and Medicine for Human Health (ChEM-H), a highly
collaborative and interdisciplinary institute. Stanford and ChEM-H will afford me all necessary research
resources, a variety of opportunities for professional development, and the opportunity to work with, and learn
from many, different scientists."
10794954,"Project Summary
The central goal of this proposal is to characterize the role of the insular cortex (InsCtx) in encoding
and shaping the physiological drive to consume nicotine in nicotine-dependent mice. The InsCtx
integrates sensory, visceral, and limbic information and is implicated in interoception: the sensing of internal
bodily states. Interoception plays a crucial role in the development of addiction because the rewarding effects
of addictive drugs and the aversive aspects of withdrawal are largely experienced as bodily sensations.
Functional imaging in human smokers shows that InsCtx responses to smoking-related cues increase with self-
reported craving intensity and with the expectancy of receiving nicotine. Intriguingly, after strokes involving the
InsCtx, smokers report increased rates of smoking cessation and fewer nicotine cravings. Nevertheless, it
remains unclear how the InsCtx encodes nicotine-replete and withdrawal states during the development of
nicotine dependence, and if targeted InsCtx manipulations can curb cued nicotine-seeking behaviors. This gap
in understanding is due in part to our inability to track the activity of large numbers of neurons throughout the
development of dependence on and withdrawal from nicotine (or other addictive drugs). I have overcome this
challenge by adapting our lab’s conceptual and technical framework for chronic two-photon calcium imaging of
hundreds of InsCtx neurons during shifts in hunger/thirst to investigate InsCtx encoding of nicotine states and
nicotine-predicting cues. Specifically, I propose to track InsCtx neurons as mice (i) develop nicotine
dependence via home-cage drinking water exposure, and (ii) learn to respond to visual cues in order to receive
oral nicotine rewards. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that as an animal becomes dependent on nicotine, the
pattern of InsCtx ongoing activity encoding states of satiety will change across days to reflect this new bodily
state. Because nicotine has direct effects centrally on the brain as well as peripherally on bodily physiology, I
will use natural and pharmacological manipulations to determine if ongoing InsCtx activity patterns reflect the
central and/or peripheral actions of nicotine. In Aim 2, I will examine how InsCtx responses to nicotine-
predicting cues correlate with concurrent recordings of mesolimbic dopamine release in the nucleus
accumbens, which is known to mediate some of the rewarding aspects of addictive drugs and is profoundly
altered in states of addiction. I will then test the hypothesis that acute optogenetic silencing of the InsCtx will
disrupt learned dopaminergic and behavioral responses to nicotine-predicting cues. These experiments will
advance our understanding of how InsCtx activity patterns change during the emergence of nicotine
dependence, and will define the role of the InsCtx in drug-seeking behaviors. This work will improve our
understanding of how exposure to nicotine modifies the neural representations associated with ‘physiological
satiety’ during the development of drug dependence, and may help establish a basis for novel manipulations of
insular cortex activity that achieve reductions in drug-seeking behaviors in patients with nicotine use disorders."
10820539,"Francisella tularensis (Ft), the causative agent of tularemia, is one of the most infectious bacterial pathogens
known. Due to its high infectivity and ease of aerosolization, it has been classified as Category A bioweapon by
the US government. The morbidity and mortality of tularemia are substantial, and given its extreme infectivity, a
significant outbreak of tularemia would readily overwhelm the capabilities of even the largest US medical
centers. Ft virulence requires genes expressed from the chromosomally encoded Ft pathogenicity island (FPI).
The expression of these genes are activated by a combination of Ft regulators: the stringent starvation protein
A (SspA), the macrophage growth locus protein A (MglA) and the pathogenicity island gene regulator (PigR),
which are expressed during Ft infection. MglA and PigR are unique to Ft whereas SspA proteins are found in
multiple bacteria. The Ft SspA, however, is unusual as it does not homodimerize but rather heterodimerizes
with MglA. PigR is a DNA-binding protein with a predicted winged-helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif.
Intriguingly, the “alarmone”, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), is also necessary for Ft virulence. Recently,
we showed that this alarmone binds directly to the MglA-SspA complex. We further showed that ppGpp binding
to MglA-SspA mediates high-affinity binding of PigR to this heterodimer. Strikingly, our data also revealed that
MglA-SspA interacts constitutively with the Ft RNAPs70 holoenzyme suggesting it represents a virulence
specialized RNAP. Given the extreme virulence and potential use of Ft as a bioweapon, there is an urgent
need to decipher the molecular mechanisms driving its virulence. The overarching goal of this proposal is the
molecular dissection of these mechanisms. Our central hypothesis is that Ft employs a conceptually novel form
of pathogenesis requiring a virulence-specialized RNAP containing MglA-SspA. We shall test our central
hypothesis and delineate the molecular mechanisms controlling the activation of Ft virulence genes through
the completion of three Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To fully characterize MglA-SspA interaction with Ft
RNAP. Structural, biochemical and cellular studies will dissect the mechanism of virulence regulation by MglA-
SspA. Specific Aim 2: To carry out structure and function analyses of Ft RNAP(MglA-SspA)-ppGpp-PigR
complexes. The mechanism behind PigR-mediated activation of the FPI will be analyzed structurally,
biochemically and in vivo. Specific Aim 3: To determine a high resolution (MglA-SspA)-ppGpp-PigR crystal
structure, identify inhibitors of ppGpp binding to MglA-SspA and obtain structures of MglA-SspA inhibitor
complexes. The successful completion of these Aims will reveal new paradigms in transcription regulation and
enable the rational design of novel anti Francisella-virulence therapeutics."
10768732,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are currently being used in three separate clinical trials
for gene therapy of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), sponsored by Solid Biosciences, Pfizer, Inc., and
Sarepta Therapeutics, respectively. The use of the first generation of AAV9 vectors in both Solid Biosciences
and Pfizer trials have led to a number of serious adverse events, including the death of a patient in the Pfizer
trial. Although the first generation of AAVrh74 vectors in the Sarepta trial were shown to be tolerated well, a
recent Phase II trial in patients with DMD failed to meet its primary functional endpoint. We have argued, based
on the fact that AAV evolved as a virus, and not as a vector for the purposes of delivery of therapeutic genes,
and thus, the full potential of the first generation of recombinant AAV vectors is unlikely to be realized. By
modifying the AAV capsid protein, we have developed the next generation (‘NextGen’) of AAV vectors, which
are up to 30-fold more efficacious at reduced doses. These vectors are also less immunogenic. We have also
modified the AAV vector genome to develop the generation X (‘GenX’) AAV vectors. These vectors mediate up
to 8-fold enhanced transgene expression. We have combined both these strategies to generate the optimized
(‘Opt’) AAV serotype vectors. These vectors are 20-30-fold more efficient at further reduced doses. We have
also documented that inclusion of specific regulatory elements within the AAV inverted terminal repeats can
significantly increase transgene expression levels. In this application, we propose to develop the Opt AAVrh74
vectors, and test the following hypotheses: (i) Liver de-targeted Opt AAVrh74 vectors containing novel muscle-
specific enhancer elements will lead to further increased levels of transgene expression at significantly lower
doses; and (ii) Opt AAVrh74 vectors can be delivered to target muscle cells at significantly reduced doses
following systemic administration in a mouse model of DMD in vivo. The following three specific aims will be
pursued:
Specific Aim 1: Development of capsid+genome-modified, liver de-targeted Opt AAVrh74 vectors for
high-efficiency transduction of primary human skeletal muscle cells in vitro, and in a mouse model in
vivo.
Specific Aim 2: Development of novel Opt AAVrh74 vectors with muscle-specific enhancer elements to
augment transgene expression at further reduced doses in a mouse model in vivo.
Specific Aim 3: Development of a novel Opt AAVrh74-micro-dystrophin vector (Opt74-µDys) for systemic
gene therapy of DMD in a mouse model in vivo.
 The development of optimized AAVrh74 vectors that are effective at lower doses, are likely to reduce the
probability of inducing the host immune responses, the vector production costs, as well as the economic cost
per patient, for the potential gene therapy of muscular dystrophies in humans."
10816553,"Project Summary/Abstract
Leukemic relapse remains the major obstacle to successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT).
Here, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) seeks to repair the underlying graft-versus-leukemia (GvL) effect that
drives allo-SCT efficacy. However the mechanisms driving clinical GvL outcomes remain poorly understood.
To address this challenge, Dr. Bachireddy has performed deep molecular phenotyping of both leukemia and
immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) across multiple timepoints during DLI response and
resistance. He previously showed reversal of T cell exhaustion, a unique form of T cell dysfunction, during DLI
response. Using high-throughput single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), he has now identified 2 main
subtypes of exhausted T cells: terminally exhausted (TE) cells, enriched in pre-DLI responding TMEs, and
progenitor exhausted (PE) cells, expanding consistently in responders post-DLI. While these subsets are
defined in murine models of T cell exhaustion that motivated inhibitors of the PD-1 pathway, their relevance to
human leukemia, roles in immunotherapeutic response, and relationship to oncogenic pathways have not been
previously elucidated. Thus, he will test the hypothesis that specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (1)
define the heterogeneity within and between TE and PE subsets and, moreover, (2) are influenced by
leukemic-derived mutations and gene expression states. In Aim 1, he will determine the regulation and function
of TE and PE subsets by, first, integrating scRNA-seq data with chromatin accessibility profiles to identify
GRNs for each subset and then functionally evaluating the relative anti-leukemic efficacy of each subset (and
each GRN) in vivo. In Aim 2, he will identify leukemic-derived molecular profiles that associate with DLI
outcome and shape T/PE T cell subsets. Leukemic genomic and scRNA-seq data will be jointly analyzed to
perform in silico identification of candidate leukemic drivers of DLI outcome and T/PE T cell subsets, which will,
in turn, be functionally evaluated in vivo. These results will identify GRNs that govern, and oncogenic pathways
that shape, TE and PE T cells, revealing novel targets for modulating cancer immunity and uncovering the
molecular circuitry underpinning leukemic-immune interactions in the post-transplant TME. Dr. Bachireddy has
outlined a five-year career development plan to meet his goal of becoming an independent investigator
focused on immunotherapy in hematologic malignancies. He has assembled an Advisory Committee of
internationally recognized experts to provide scientific/career mentorship and enlisted collaborators who are
experts in computational biology, systems immunology, and functional genomics to provide experimental
advice and specific training in the field. The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Broad Institute of MIT and
Harvard are the ideal environments for completion of his scientific and career goals, given their outstanding
research communities and substantial records for training independent physician-scientists."
10814883,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) comprises a collection of mature T-cell neoplasms that share elevated
expression of CD30 and anaplastic cytology. ALCL subtypes are divided into two classes based on the status of
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ALK+ and ALK-. While ALK+ ALCL is relatively homogeneous, ALK- ALCL
represents a heterogeneous group comprising systemic ALK negative and primary cutaneous ALCL (pC-ALCL).
The recently recognized breast implant-associated (BIA) ALCL, which arises in the seroma cavity surrounding
breast implants, was acknowledged as a distinct clinical and pathological entity that shares morphologic features
with ALK- ALCL. Current therapeutic strategies for ALCL are largely based on aggressive B-cell lymphoma
regimens. However, the outcomes are generally much worse in patients with ALK- ALCL than in those with ALK+
ALCL. Thus, there is a need to develop novel, preferably small molecule-based targeted therapies for these
lymphoid malignancies, especially in ALK- and BIA ALCL cases. A major barrier to this goal is the lack of a
systematic and comprehensive understanding of the deep molecular characteristics of ALK- and BIA ALCL
pathology, which is clearly needed in order to identify critical therapeutic vulnerabilities. To address the gaps in
knowledge, we applied an unbiased high throughput CRISPR screening in ALCL, and identified an unexpected
role of the IL-1R-MyD88 pathway in supporting ALK- and BIA ALCL. The IL-1R signaling pathway is a key
mediator of immunity and inflammation and has been shown to play a critical role in many solid tumors; however,
its role in lymphoid malignancies has not been established. Indeed, our preliminary studies provide the first
unequivocal evidence that IL-1R1 pathway plays an essential role in supporting ALK- and BIA ALCL cell survival.
Clinically, we found that IL-1 receptor and IL-1α expression are consistently elevated in primary ALK- cases, and
this is correlated with IL-1R signaling activation (p-IRAK4 level) in primary samples. Moreover, using RNA-seq
analysis, we identified a set of IL-1R pathway regulated genes in ALK- ALCL that overlapped significantly with
signatures reflecting JAK-STAT3 activity and TH17/TH1 phenotyping. Finally, a highly specific IRAK4 inhibitor
shows promising activity against ALK- and BIA ALCL in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Altogether, these
findings provide strong support for our hypothesis that the IL-1R pathway promotes ALK- and BIA ALCL
pathogenesis, and that targeting this pathway could be a novel therapeutic strategy in these diseases. In this
study, we will test our hypothesis through the following aims: 1) Elucidation of the exact role of IL-1R pathway in
ALK- and BIA ALCL, 2) Understanding of mechanisms regulating this pathway and its relationship to recurrent
genetic lesions in ALCL, and 3) Validation of the IL-1R pathway as a novel therapeutic target in these
malignancies. The proposed studies should provide critical insights into the molecular circuitry that drives these
types of ALCL and, consequently, result in the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies for these
distinct lymphoproliferative disorders."

GM1-gangliosidosis is a rare, fatal, neurodegenerative genetic disease caused by the deficiency of β-
galactosidase enzyme activity and characterized clinically by a wide range of variable neurovisceral,
ophthalmological and dysmorphic features. There are currently no effective therapies for GM1-gangliosidosis
and only symptomatic treatments are available. In preclinical models, adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene therapy
that restores the β-galactosidase enzyme activity is the most promising therapy for delaying symptom onset,
reducing storage in the brain and peripheral tissues, and increasing lifespan. These impressive results have
provided the foundation for AAV gene therapy clinical trials. One of the major challenges for developing
treatments for GM1-gangliosidosis is the difficulty in the evaluation of treatment efficacy due to the small and
heterogeneous patient population as well as slow progression in non-infantile patients. Recently we used liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify a pentasaccharide (referred to as H3N2b)
that is elevated > 20-fold in patient urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and in the central nervous
system (CNS) of the GM1-gangliosidosis cat. The CNS H3N2b levels in the GM1-gangliosidosis cat are reduced
in response to AAV-treatment. H3N2b has potential as a pharmacodynamics/response biomarker for
assessment of AAV-treatment efficacy in GM1-gangliosidosis. The goal of this proposal is to validate LC-MS/MS
methods for determination of H3N2b in human urine, plasma, CSF, which will be used to assess AAV gene
therapy treatment efficacy in a clinical trial. The aims of this application are 1) validation of LC-MS/MS methods
for quantification of H3N2b in human plasma, urine, and CSF; 2) assessment of H3N2b in samples collected
from GM1-gangliosidosis natural history study; and 3) application of H3N2b for assessment of treatment efficacy
of AAV gene therapy. The proposed work will provide a much-needed tool for assessing therapeutic efficacy."
10817764,"As they progress, malignant tumors accumulate cross-linked collagen fibrils that enhance matrix stiffness,
thereby activating collagen receptors that trigger cancer cell invasion and dissemination. We previously
reported that a collagen modifying enzyme called lysyl hydroxylase 2 (LH2) is highly expressed in metastatic
lung cancer cells and promotes metastasis by increasing the amount of a particularly stable type of collagen
cross-link called hydroxylysine aldehyde-derived collagen cross-link (HLCC). Although LH family members
(LH1-3) have highly conserved LH and glucosylgalactosyltransferase (GGT) domains, LH2 reportedly lacks
GGT activity and is unique among LHs in its ability to hydroxylate lysine (lys) residues on collagen N- and C-
termini (“telopeptides”) that are required to generate HLCCs. The structural basis for LH2's unique functional
properties remains unclear. The studies proposed herein will address this crucial knowledge gap. On the basis
of collagen LH and GGT domain crystal structures that we recently solved, we show that LH2 has telopeptidyl
LH (t-LH) activity owing to a unique basic residue cluster that generates electrostatic interactions with acidic
residues on collagen. Furthermore, by using a new collagen GGT activity assay we developed that is more
sensitive than ones reported previously, we show that LH2 has GGT activity owing to an alternatively spliced
exon 13a-encoded loop that resides at the entrance of the GGT active site. We show that LH2 isoforms that
lack (LH2a) or contain (LH2b) exon 13a are differentially expressed in the TCGA lung cancer cohort, and that
LH2b is the predominant isoform expressed in an orthotopic KMLC model in which LH2 promotes metastasis
and causes widespread alterations in intra-tumoral immunity. We developed defined collagen matrices that are
deficient or replete in LH2-mediated HLCCs (total or glucosylated) and used these matrices as tools to show
that HLCCs influence lung cancer cell behaviors. On the basis of these preliminary results, we postulate that
LH2 drives lung cancer metastasis through dual (LH- and GGT-mediated) collagen modifications and will test
this hypothesis by completing 3 specific aims. Aim 1: To demonstrate a causal relationship between LH2's
electrostatic interactions with collagen, HLCC formation, and lung cancer metastasis. Aim 2: To demonstrate a
causal relationship between inclusion of LH2's exon 13a, collagen glucosylation, and metastasis. Aim 3: To
demonstrate a causal relationship between LH2's dual (t-LH- and GGT-mediated) collagen modifications and
LAIR-1-mediated immunosuppression. In summary, the novelty of our proposal rests in an hypothesis that is
based on unique insight into LH2's dual enzymatic activities and the tools we developed to generate that
hypothesis (e.g., crystal structures, enzymatic assays, and defined collagen matrices). Findings from these
studies will provide a basis for future testing of selective LH2 antagonists that we have already identified from
high-throughput screens and have begun to optimize outside the scope of this application."

Randomized controlled trials by Basch (collaborator) and colleagues demonstrated that weekly electronic
home-based PRO symptom monitoring with automated alerts to clinicians (Home ePRO) in cancer patients
was associated with reduced healthcare utilization, improved quality of life, and increased overall survival.
However, these trials were administered using infrastructure supported by research funding. A knowledge gap
remains about optimal implementation strategies for and effectiveness of Home ePROs in real-world settings.
To address this gap, investigators from two institutions will conduct a large-scale, population-based
implementation of an evidence-based Home ePRO intervention for all adult cancer patients receiving
chemotherapy, including vulnerable populations such as African Americans, rural residents, and
socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. This implementation will leverage infrastructure from Medicare's
payment reform projects (Oncology Care Model, Oncology Care First Model), which require and financially
support patient navigators, a natural workforce for Home ePRO implementation. Our hypothesis is that the
deployed implementation strategies will result in successful navigator-delivered Home ePRO, which will
improve both patient and health system outcomes. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research (CFIR), this hypothesis will be tested using a hybrid type 2 design with three specific aims: 1)
evaluate implementation of navigator-delivered Home ePRO for all cancer patients across multiple practice
sites; 2) examine the barriers, facilitators, and implementation strategies used in implementing navigator-
delivered Home ePRO; and 3) assess the impact of Home ePRO on clinical and utilization outcomes. In Aim 1,
Home ePRO will be evaluated using implementation outcomes (service penetrance, provider
adoption/penetration, intervention fidelity). In Aim 2, we will gauge patient and healthcare team perceptions of
barriers and facilitators of navigator-led Home ePRO, implementation strategies used to address these
barriers, implementation strategy fidelity, and perception of implementation strategy ability to address barriers
using an iterative qualitative analysis. In Aim 3, patient-level outcomes (functional status, distress, depression,
healthcare utilization, cost, survival) will be evaluated using real-world data sources. The project is innovative
because it will be the first study to evaluate real-world implementation of navigator-led Home ePRO for all
cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, an approach that is both immediately scalable and sustainable within
value-based payment models. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to demonstrate
successful implementation of navigator-delivered Home ePRO and effectiveness of the ePRO intervention on
diverse patient populations. Furthermore, the project will generate an implementation blueprint of successful
implementation strategies that can be easily applied to other patient-reported outcomes, with the potential to
positively impact patient care as health care transitions to a value-based system."

Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the pathologic formation of extra-skeletal bone forming almost exclusively at
sites of mechanical stress, that occurs in ~20% of patients after hip arthroplasty, burns or musculoskeletal injury.
Currently, no therapeutics or physical therapy-based protocols exist to prevent HO. In this regard, there is a void
in our understanding of the causative mechanotransductive pathways behind this debilitating process. Our
unbiased transcription profiles in mouse HO-mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) recovered from HO sites in
combination with immunostaining of mouse and human HO revealed that a series of mechanotranduction-linked
pathways, including discoidin receptor 2 (DDR2), FAK and the Hippo effectors, YAP and TAZ, are highly
upregulated in tandem with observed changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) alignment. Using a novel, regional
MPC-specific inducible Cre system (Hoxa11-CreERT2), we have compiled preliminary data that support critical
roles for DDR2 signaling and stage-specific immobilization in both triggering FAK/YAP/TAZ signaling and MPC
lineage commitment, but also an unexpected function in controlling ECM alignment. Together, these
observations have led to our central hypothesis that MPC DDR2 signaling is necessary for mobility-induced
changes in ECM alignment that trigger aberrant osteochondral differentiation at HO sites and can be blocked by
DDR2 inhibition or injury stage-specific immobilization.
Aim 1: Define the role of DDR2 as a critical upstream regulator of FAK/YAP/TAZ signaling in controlling
the induction and progression of HO. We hypothesize that DDR2-mechanotransductive signaling alters
osteochondral differentiation and HO in vivo and can be targeted with cell specific deletion models or translatable
clinical therapies.
Aim 2: Determine the optimal post-injury timing during which MPCs can be redirected away from
aberrant osteochondral fate and pathologic ECM alignment through immobilization-based intervention.
We hypothesize that immobilization during the early proliferative phase after injury will block pathologic changes
in ECM alignment with disease-ameliorating effects on MPC fate determination and aberrant ossification.
Aim 3: Characterize the role of mobilization-induced DDR2 activation on collagen alignment/anisotropy
and mechanotransductive signaling. We hypothesize that DDR2 activity drives ECM alignment independently
of limb mobility in vivo or cyclic stretch in vitro.
Impact: The proposed studies will provide a comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of how DDR2 and
joint mobility regulate ECM alignment, cell fate and HO using conditional deletion models and clinical therapies."
10818470,"The vast majority of common genetic variation underlying risk for neuropsychiatric disorders 
resides in poorly annotated non-coding regions of the genome and likely impacts the regulation of 
gene expression. In order to move from a location in the genome associated with risk to a 
regulatory mechanism, there are several major gaps in knowledge including: (a) the causal 
variant(s) within the associated locus, (b) the regulatory elements impacted by those causal 
variant(s), (c) the cell-type(s) and developmental time period(s) at which the causal variants(s) 
exert their effects, and (d) the gene(s) impacted by those causal variant(s). In this proposal, we 
will identify genetic influences on two features of chromatin architecture (enhancer 
histone marks and their 30 interactions) during human cortical development in order to more 
completely explain regulatory mechanisms leading to risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. In a large 
population of post-mortem human developing cortical tissue that has previously undergone 
genome-wide genotyping and transcriptomic profiling, we will utilize a technique that 
allows us to simultaneously measure enhancer activity and its interaction profile 
(H3K27ac HiChIP). We will then identify genetic influences on these two features of chromatin and 
their co-localization with previous and growing neuropsychiatric disorder genome-wide association 
(GWAS) risk loci. Psychiatric disorder risk variants may exert their regulatory impact by (1) 
changing enhancers (H3K27ac QTLs or histone acetylation (ha)QTLs) and/or (2) chromatin 
interaction (interaction-QTLs). This novel class of QTLs will enhance our understanding of 
the molecular processes underlying human neurodevelopment and how that development is altered in 
neuropsychiatric disorders. Further, we will conduct two orthogonal methods to validate the impact 
of the genetic variants and assess their cell-type specificity. We will perform cell-type specific 
massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) to validate the functional impact of haQTLs. In this 
assay, cloned oligos containing the enhancer associated alleles drive expression of barcoded 
transcripts that can be used to assess regulatory differences and identify causal variants. We 
will also apply a haplotype-specific chromatin imaging technique to visualize how regulatory 
variation impacts chromatin interactions in individual nuclei. This technique paints 
sections of each chromosome with allele-specific oligos in order to visualize and 
measure the physical interactions of the 0NA molecule. Completing the aims of this proposal will 
allow us to identify largely complete regulatory mechanisms impacting human brain development and 
risk for neuropsychiatric disorders."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) is a prototypic autoimmune disease marked by a disproportionate
prevalence and severity burden in women of African ancestry (AA). There is a critical need for efforts that identify
the molecular mechanisms through which positive and negative social determinants of health contribute to the
lupus health disparity, so that progress in improving disease outcomes can be made and the health disparities
gap can be closed. This research project addresses the objectives of PAR-19-372 to “1) advance understanding
of mechanisms by which social factors lead to epigenetic changes that affect minority health and health
disparities, and 2) promote epigenetics research to better predict disease or resiliency among health disparity
populations.” We are seeking to identify and characterize the epigenetic mechanisms by which positive and
negative social experiences affect gene function and thereby influence SLE in AA women. We have previously
shown that racial discrimination is associated with worse disease outcomes in AA women, while social support
seems to have a positive impact. Multiple environmental exposures, including psychosocial factors, affect
variation in DNA methylation. Despite their influence on SLE in AA women, it is not known how environmental
experiences affect and operate through the individual epigenome to influence disease. We will test the following
hypotheses in AA women: 1) exposure to adverse and protective social contexts is associated with epigenomic
changes involving immune, inflammatory, and energy metabolism pathways, which in turn are associated with
disease outcomes; and 2) social support compensates for the detrimental, independent effect of racial
discrimination on SLE through epigenetic and gene regulatory mechanisms. We will leverage our existing registry
and infrastructure, together with our community partnership, to accomplish this community-engaged integrative
mechanistic study. We will enroll 300 AA women with SLE and 300 unaffected AA women, collect
sociodemographic, medical, genotypic, leukocyte proportion, DNA methylation, and gene expression data, and
use validated measures to assess life course racial discrimination and social support. We propose to: identify
variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) associated with (a) exposure to racial discrimination, (b) exposure to social
support, and (c) epigenetic age acceleration (Aim 1); to assess whether social DNAm sites affect gene
expression (Aim 2); and identify the synergistic effects of social factors on DNAm changes on SLE and develop
a social factors-DNAm predictive model for disease outcomes (Aim 3). This will be the first study investigating
epigenetic mechanisms by which risk and resiliency factors affect gene function and lupus in AA women. These
results will greatly expand the knowledge of how social factors affect gene function, disease outcomes, and
health disparities, which might inform the development of effective interventions to close the health disparities
gap. Finally, given the shared etiologic mechanisms, these findings have broader applicability to other
autoimmune diseases."
10832061,"Circadian disruption, such as that seen in shift workers, predisposes to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes
(T2D), and increases the rates of coronary and carotid atherovascular disease (AVD). AVD is the leading cause
of death in the United States and diabetes increases the risk of AVD by 4-fold. However, to date there are no
proven interventions that prevent or mitigate these deleterious effects of circadian disruption. It is, therefore,
imperative to define the molecular underpinnings of circadian disruption on diabetes and atherosclerosis and to
test targeted environmental and pharmacological circadian protective interventions. We have shown previously
that in mice genetic disruption of the circadian clock, by deletion of Bmal1, a non-redundant core clock gene
leads to oxidative stress in β-cells and diabetes. Our preliminary data demonstrates that in mice chronic rotating
shift work schedule-induced circadian disruption is associated with glucose intolerance and diabetes, and with
accelerated atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaque phenotypes. RNA-seq analysis from livers of these mice
demonstrated enrichment of genes involved in oxidative and ER stress. The overarching hypothesis for this
proposal is (1) loss of synchronization between environment, hypothalamic central clock and cell-intrinsic
peripheral clocks leads to dysregulation of cellular stress responses in insulin-sensitive tissues and arterial
macrophages, resulting in metabolic syndrome, T2D and AVD and (2) resynchronizing or enhancing the
molecular clock function will mitigate circadian desynchrony-induced diabetes and AVD. We will use inducible,
cell-type specific genetic Bmal1 deletion, rescue and gain-of-function mouse models to mechanistically test the
differential central and peripheral clock regulation of oxidative and endoplasmic-reticulum (ER) stress pathways
in the pathogenesis of T2D and AVD. These are coupled with clock-modulating environmental and
pharmacological interventional studies of potential translational significance to mitigate risk of T2D and AVD.
The SPECIFIC AIMS for this proposal are: Aim 1- To test if modulating light-dark patterns (circadian-blind but
vision-permissive) will prevent or mitigate circadian desynchrony-induced T2D and AVD. Aim 2-
Pharmacological clock modulation to mitigate circadian desynchrony-induced T2D and AVD. Aim 3- Genetic
deletion and rescue of Bmal1 in central and peripheral clocks to determine the cell-specific requirement of
intrinsic clocks in transcriptional regulation of cellular stress responses in the pathogenesis of circadian
desynchrony-induced T2D and AVD. This Multi-PI proposal is from an interdisciplinary team of three PIs with
complementary expertise in circadian biology, genetic models of circadian disruption diabetes and metabolism
(Dr. Yechoor), lighting interventions, work-related circadian disruption (Dr. Figueiro), AVD, its molecular
mechanisms and foam cell biology (Dr. Paul). The successful completion of these aims will provide mechanistic
insight into the cardiometabolic consequences of circadian desynchrony and possibly lead to translatable
pharmacological and/or environmental interventions."
10827951,"ABSTRACT
Approximately 5.7 million Americans have dementia. Alzheimer’s dementia accounts for the majority of cases.
The rising prevalence and impact of dementia in the US, coupled with a lack of effective treatments to prevent,
cure, or slow dementia progression, have galvanized an urgent need to identify modifiable risk factors. One
may be obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This highly underdiagnosed and consequential sleep disorder affects
at least 24% of older Americans. Although emerging evidence has linked OSA to cognitive impairment and
dementia incidence, existing reports have insufficiently examined potential key confounders as well as
biologically relevant biomarkers that may influence this relationship. Furthermore, little research has focused
on the effects of OSA treatment with positive airway pressure therapy (PAP) on risk for development of
dementia. Recent data from the investigators demonstrate a lower incidence of Alzheimer’s dementia among
Medicare beneficiaries with OSA who are treated with PAP, compared to non-PAP users. This suggests a
protective role for PAP use on dementia risk in OSA-affected older adults. Data from the investigators also has
shown sex disparities in OSA treatment. The vulnerability of women to both Alzheimer’s dementia and OSA
under-treatment further highlights the question of whether OSA is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s dementia.
Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to assess the longitudinal impact of OSA and PAP on
cognitive outcomes among older women and men, and to deconstruct unexplored pathways between
pathological sleep and dementia. This will be accomplished by leveraging objective cognitive, sleep, health,
and biomarker data that are collected biennially from the Health and Retirement Study. Data from this
nationally representative, multi-ethnic longitudinal cohort of older adults will be harmonized with Medicare
claims data to create a large dataset uniquely suited to address critical questions that would be unfeasibly
expensive to investigate in a prospective manner. Findings from this study will provide new insight into sleep-
based targets to reduce cognitive morbidity of older women and men; inform more targeted randomized clinical
trials; and foster efforts to identify older individuals most likely to benefit from evaluation and treatment for
sleep disorders."
11057264,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 As pediatric trauma mortality in the United States has declined over the past several decades, children
are surviving after increasingly severe injuries. Many children surviving severe trauma experience prolonged
impairments in quality of life, function, and psychosocial health. Existing studies have only evaluated how injury
characteristics affect morbidity; it is unknown whether any modifiable factors influence long-term outcomes.
Critically injured children often experience medical complications of their initial injury with prolonged treatment
in the intensive care unit, and thus there may be components of their clinical course that contribute to morbidity
beyond the effects of the injury alone. Identification of these clinical factors may provide targets for
improvement in critical care management in order to optimize recovery from severe pediatric trauma.
 The long-term career goal of the K23 candidate, Elizabeth Killien, MD, MPH, is to build an
independently funded research program to develop interventions to improve long-term outcomes among
critically injured children. Her proposed research project will evaluate the contribution of a variety of clinical
factors to long-term deterioration in health status after pediatric trauma. The specific aims are to 1) evaluate
how the longitudinal trajectory of post-discharge recovery differs among children surviving critical injury
compared to other acute illnesses; 2) determine which clinical exposures are associated with outcomes for
trauma compared to other acute illnesses; and 3) assess the generalizability of the important clinical exposures
identified locally in a multicenter national trauma cohort. These objectives are consistent with the priorities of
the Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Branch of NICHD to conduct “multidisciplinary research across the
continuum of care” to understand “the long-term impact of trauma on child health outcomes.”
 To acquire the skills necessary to accomplish this project and subsequently develop an R-series
proposal, Dr. Killien will undertake didactic and experiential training to 1) develop expertise in multi-
dimensional, longitudinal assessment of post-hospitalization outcomes; 2) gain experience with prospective
study design and management and collaboration with research networks; 3) acquire skills in advanced
statistical methods; and 4) facilitate her transition to independence. Dr. Killien has assembled an
interdisciplinary mentorship and collaborator team with expertise in pediatric trauma, critical care, organ
dysfunction, outcomes assessment, and statistical methodology to ensure completion of the proposed
research and training and a successful transition to independence. Her research and training will be conducted
at the University of Washington's Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center. The proposed award will
augment Dr. Killien's existing strengths in outcome assessment after critical illness and provide the additional
training necessary for her to become an independent investigator in pediatric critical care medicine."
10824445,"Project Summary
Rapid detection and response to injury is essential for the survival of all organisms. In animals, wounded tissues
must quickly heal and locally regenerate. Failure in wound detection causes acute and chronic conditions ranging
from poorly healing wounds and infections to chronically inflamed skins, fibrosis and cancer. Although the exe-
cution mechanisms of wound healing (involving cytokines, growth factors, etc.) have been extensively studied,
its initiation mechanisms remain little understood. My vision is to develop a genetically and physically plau-
sible model of wound detection. There is a fundamental gap in understanding of how wounds are initially
detected, and how the first wound signals rapidly transmit information on injury over tissue-scale dis-
tances to faraway leukocytes, epithelial, and other cells that participate in healing.
I study wound detection in live zebrafish whose wound responses and immune system resemble those of mam-
mals yet are better amenable to high-resolution, real-time imaging at high animal throughputs. To this end, my
lab combines quantitative intravital imaging with unbiased computational image analysis and various interdisci-
plinary approaches ranging from biophysics to mathematical modeling. Over a decade, I have identified three
chemical and one physical wound signals: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), extracellular ATP (eATP), arachidonic acid
(AA), and nuclear membrane tension. These discoveries triggered new activity in an old field. Yet, critical mech-
anistic gaps remain: How is eATP sensed to mediate rapid wound closure, and how does it instruct faraway cells
although it is rapidly broken down in the tissue and cannot diffuse far from a wound? How are H2O2 and AA
signals integrated to mediate rapid inflammatory responses to wounds? Wound signals cause inflammation- do
they also resolve it? How is wound mechanotransduction regulated on the molecular and cell biological level?
These questions are of high basic biological interest, and the pathways they concern are major disease regula-
tors. Answering them over the next five years can pave way for novel therapeutic approaches.
My work on wound signaling has opened the door to other areas of biology where analogous mechanisms may
drive medically important processes, such as infection responses, cancer and bone regeneration/remodeling.
Although the primary focus of my group will remain on early wound signaling, I plan to explore some of these
new areas, taking advantage of the R35’s flexible funding scheme."
10817103,"The growing epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes requires new strategies for prevention and treatment.
We discovered a structurally novel, family of endogenous bioactive lipids, branched fatty Acid esters of
Hydroxy fatty Acids (FAHFAs). A subfamily, Palmitic Acid esters of Hydroxy Stearic Acids (PAHSAs), has
anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects. PAHSA levels are low in serum and adipose tissue of insulin-resistant
versus insulin-sensitive people, and levels correlate highly with insulin sensitivity. In insulin-resistant
mice, PAHSA administration improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, in part by enhancing insulin
action to suppress hepatic glucose production which results from improved lipolysis suppression. PAHSAs are
anti-inflammatory and reduce colitis severity and the incidence of auto-immune Type 1 diabetes in mice. We
have made tremendous strides in discovering new activities for PAHSAs, identifying additional families of
bioactive and storage forms of FAHFAs, and uncovering biochemical pathways and enzymes that control
tissue FAHFA levels. These studies underscore that FAHFAs are a highly-regulated class of lipids with
tremendous translational potential. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms that
regulate tissue and serum FAHFA levels in physiologic and disease states by identifying enzymes and
pathways that regulate FAHFA biosynthesis, degradation and incorporation into other lipids. We will use
innovative and robust assays we developed with isotopically-labeled FAHFAs and their precursors to measure
FAHFA synthesis and degradation in vivo, target specific pathways of FAHFA regulation, and identify
additional, missing enzymes and other factors that regulate FAHFA biosynthesis, degradation, transport and
storage. We have already made terrific progress by identifying 3 FAHFA hydrolases and the first FAHFA
biosynthetic transacylase. We will delineate this new biosynthetic pathway using novel mechanistic studies.
We also propose a highly complementary, innovative, systems analyses that will integrate transcriptomic data
with targeted FAHFA measurements. First, we will take advantage of the large, reciprocal regulation of
FAHFAs in our unique mouse models with altered expression of Glut4 and ChREBP, to find unknown factors
mediating this regulation. Since Glut4 and ChREBP expression in adipose tissue from humans correlates with
insulin sensitivity and adipose FAHFA levels, genes identified with these experiments could have clinical
relevance. The second approach exploits the natural genetic variation in the diversity outbred (DO) mice,
which have as much natural genetic variation as the human population. We will perform targeted
measurements of ~300 different FAHFA isomers in adipose tissue, liver and plasma of ~500 DO mice and
leverage the existing genetic and transcriptomic data from DO mice to find new ""drivers""/regulators of tissue
FAHFA levels. These studies will advance our understanding of FAHFA biology in health and disease and
potentially uncover novel enzymes and pathways in lipid metabolism that can be targeted for clinical benefit."
10830957,"This proposal aims to manipulate DNA deaminase enzymes to generate hyperactive and controllable base
editors that can be targeted for precise gene editing. Base editing of the immunoglobulin locus by AID, the
ancestral member of the AID/APOBEC family of cytosine deaminase enzymes, normally initiates maturation of
antibody responses in B-cells, while APOBECs provide protection against retroviruses. Out of their physiological
context, when DNA deaminases are directed by catalytically-impaired CRIPSR/Cas proteins, their base editing
activity can be used to introduce targeted mutations at a desired genomic locus. While this system offers a
potentially powerful means to edit the genome for biological or therapeutic purposes, base editors have two
barriers that limit their broader application in basic and translational research. First, DNA deaminases have
naturally evolved to be constrained enzymes with low overall catalytic activity, as hyperactivation is associated
with increased oncogenic mutations. Second, when dysregulated, AID/APOBECs are known to act outside of
their targets, promoting cancer mutagenesis, chromosomal translocations, and resistance to chemotherapy.
Given that natural regulatory constraints on DNA deaminases are lost in base editor complexes, these constructs
pose similar risks to the genome. In this proposal, we harness our extensive knowledge of the mechanism,
structure and function of deaminase enzymes in order to overcome these challenges. For one, hyperactive
deaminases have been generated to overcome the naturally attenuated activity, and we will exploit these variants
to evaluate the hypothesis that increasing the deamination rate can improve the efficiency of the base editing
reaction, while simultaneously improving precision. Second, we have devised split deaminases that can only be
reconstituted at the targeted locus under the control of a small molecule. This strategy newly offers
spatiotemporal control, a critical requirement that will facilitate the use of base editors in the lab and is essential
to therapeutic applications in patients. Given the wide range of potential uses for base editors, we will
demonstrate the importance of efficiency and control broadly across diverse genomic sites, and then specifically
by generating enhanced chimeric antigen receptor expressing T (CAR-T) cells as a model system. The tools
developed here will globally advance deaminases as base editors and will readily translate to other innovations
in CRISPR/Cas proteins, and to genome engineering more generally."

Calvarial bone defects commonly occur as a result of trauma, congenital anomalies and iatrogenic conditions.
The healing of bone defects relies on the regenerative capability of calvarial bones to replace damaged bone
tissues and the availability of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) is one of the key factors for generating new bones to
restore both structural and functional integrity. Calvarial SSCs that express marker gene Gli1, Axin2 or Prx1
reside in the sutural stem cell niche and contribute to calvarial bone homeostasis and healing after injury. It
remains unclear how calvarial SSCs translocate from the sutural niche to distant regions of the calvarial bones
for bone repair after injury of sites remote to the suture. Our preliminary analysis through 2-photon imaging
indicates that Gli1-expressing calvarial SSCs not only reside in the sutural niche but also line the walls of blood
vessels distributed widely throughout the postnatal calvarial bones. In this project, we will test the hypothesis
that calvarial SSCs in the sutural niche could translocate with vascular invasion that initiates at the postnatal
suture, and could reside within calvarial bones to contribute to bone regeneration after injury. We propose two
specific aims for this project: 1) Determine if vascular invasion from the suture results in bone marrow cavity
formation in postnatal calvarial bones, and 2) Determine if calvarial SSCs in the sutural niche translocate with
vascular invasion to establish the SSC niche in bone marrow cavities of postnatal calvarial bones. This
research proposal leverages the unique expertise of two investigative labs to address a key gap in our
knowledge of calvarial healing. Successful completion of this exploratory research will set the stage for further
mechanistic studies such as molecular regulation of calvarial SSC translocation, which could facilitate the
development of new therapeutic approaches for rapid bone regeneration after injury."
10824245,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome organization is driven by chromatin, the fundamental unit being the nucleosome that is made up of
histone proteins. In addition to canonical histones, histone variants exist that diversify chromatin and play
specialized roles in genome maintenance. Although best studied in transcription, histone H2A variants in
particular are emerging as critical participants in DNA damage responses including DNA repair that protect cells
from the constant threat of endogenous DNA damage and mutations, which are known to be drivers of human
diseases including cancer. Based on our studies, macroH2A1.2 plays vital functions in DNA repair and DNA
damage associated transcriptional regulation. Here, we will employ innovative biochemical and cell-based
systems to identify mechanistically how macroH2A histone variant, in collaboration with PARP1 and the histone
demethylase KDM5A, orchestrate DNA damage response functions.
 Specifically, we will determine how macroH2A and KDM5A are involved in radiation and PARP inhibitor
(PARPi) responses. We hypothesize that PARPi can interfere with KDM5A function and that effector proteins
promote the function of these factors at breaks, including transcription regulation and HR repair. We will identify
macroH2A functions in DNA repair and therapeutic responses using cancer and non-transformed cell lines.
Using cell complementation, we will define the specific interactions, domains and modifications involved in these
pathways and responses. Although macroH2A, KDM5A and other macroH2A effector proteins are known to be
involved in cancer, these studies will identify their genome integrity functions and importance for DNA damage
responses involving radiation and PARPi.
 Our long-term goals are to define mechanistically how chromatin and its associated factors contribute to
genome integrity and how deficiencies in these pathways can be targeted in cancer. This proposed work
contributes to these goals through a combination of genetic, biochemical and cellular approaches in human cells
to identify and define macroH2A pathways that promote genome integrity, including through DNA repair and
transcriptional responses. These studies will deliver new mechanistic insights into how this pathways protects
the genome and determine if dysregulation of this pathway in cancer can provide opportunities for therapeutic
interventions."

This application seeks partial support for the 2023, 2025, and 2027 Conferences on Implantable Auditory
Prostheses (CIAP). The 2023 CIAP is scheduled to be held at the Granlibakken Conference Center, Lake Tahoe,
CA, July 9-14, 2023. The cochlear implant (CI) is the first neural prosthesis in widespread clinical application for
restoring sound sensation and speech understanding to the severely hard-of-hearing population who have
difficulties understanding speech with acoustic hearing aids. Over the past 30 years, dramatic improvements in
patients' performance with these devices have been achieved and hence a wider population of patients can
benefit from cochlear implants. Currently the average speech understanding score for implanted postlingually
deafened adults is nearly 80% correct for sentence recognition in quiet and 50% correct in low levels of
background noise. Congenitally deaf children who receive a CI prior to age 2 are achieving nearly normal rates
of speech and language development. CIs can even provide significant improvement in communication for adults
who have substantial residual acoustic hearing. These advances have benefitted considerably from the collective
efforts of researchers in a broad array of scientific disciplines, from cellular biology, physiology, materials science,
and signal processing, to linguistics and cognition. This interdisciplinary collaboration and cooperation has been
fostered in large part through a series of biennial conferences, originating with a 1983 Gordon Conference. These
conferences are the only forum related to CIs in which scientific research issues are the sole focus of active
participants in the auditory community who contribute to moving the field forward. Even the best CI users though
face significant limitations in music perception as well as speech perception in challenging listening
environments. The long-term goal of CIAP is to generate cutting-edge research ideas to improve the design and
function of auditory prostheses. The Specific Aims are to provide (1) a global forum for the presentation and
discussion of the latest and highest quality research, (2) an atmosphere that is conducive to: disseminating new
findings through scientific discussion, stimulating new lines of research, and facilitating collaborations through
social networking, and (3) an opportunity for young investigators and many trainees in the field to present their
work and network with established investigators. CIAP conferences use the Gordon Research Conference model
of organization, with ample time for discussion within the program, unstructured time to encourage spontaneous
informal discussions and brainstorming, and an isolated “retreat” location where participants spend most of their
waking hours with other conference participants."
10756571,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Secondary lymphedema is a common and dreaded disease that occurs in patients treated for a variety
of solid tumors. An estimated 20–40% of Americans treated surgically for breast cancer, melanoma,
gynecological or urologic tumors go on to develop lymphedema. Once the disease develops, it is usually
progressive and causes significant functional impairment, recurrent infections, and decreased quality of life.
Current treatments are palliative, aiming to treat symptoms and prevent progression rather than cure the
underlying anatomic abnormalities. Thus, development of novel treatments for this disease is an important
goal.
 Recent studies have shown that infiltration of T helper 2 (Th2)-differentiated CD4+ cells is an important
mediator of lymphedema development by regulating fibroadipose tissue deposition, preventing formation of
collateral lymphatics, decreasing lymphatic pumping, and causing lymphatic leakiness/dysfunction. However,
the cellular mechanisms that activate these Th2 inflammatory responses remain unknown. In preliminary
studies, we have found that the epidermis may play an important role in regulating Th2 inflammatory
responses in lymphedema. For example, we have found that the expression of Th2-inducing cytokines—
cytokines known to coordinate Th2 inflammation in other chronic skin disorders—is significantly increased by
keratinocytes in lymphedematous tissues of patients with unilateral upper extremity lymphedema. We have
also found that the expression of serine proteases, an important mechanism regulating Th2-inducing cytokine
expression in other skin disorders, is also increased. Using mouse models, we have found that epidermal
changes, including decreased expression of skin barrier proteins and of Th2-inducing cytokines, precedes
infiltration of Th2 differentiated CD4+ cells. Based on these preliminary studies, as well as the pathophysiology
of other Th2-mediated chronic skin disorders, we will test the hypothesis that impaired skin barrier function and
skin pH regulate the expression of Th2-inducing cytokines by keratinocytes following lymphatic injury. Our
study is innovative because the role of the epidermis has not been elucidated. This gap in our knowledge is
important as epidermal changes are a prominent finding in lymphedema. We will test our hypothesis by
analyzing skin barrier function, pH, and Th2-inducing cytokine expression in patients with unilateral breast
cancer-related lymphedema. In other studies, we will use animal models to analyze the cellular mechanisms
that regulate epidermal Th2-inducing cytokine expression and how these changes regulate the
pathophysiology of lymphedema."
10754244,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a driver of carcinogenesis in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma
(OPSCC). HPV infects epithelial keratinocytes and alters host cell signaling to suit viral replication. HPV
simultaneously promotes basal cell growth and represses cell differentiation programming causing increased
basal cell retention within stratified squamous epithelia and tumorigenesis from high-risk HPVs. The HPV
protein E7 is a major driving oncogenic factor responsible for promoting these effects. While it has been
documented that high-risk E7 causes degradation of host retinoblastoma tumor suppressor RB1, leading to
increased cell growth and DNA replication, RB1 degradation does not solely cause E7 tumorigenic activity. E7
activity is more tumorigenic than RB1 loss alone. In addition to growth stimulation, HPV requires repression of
cell differentiation. Our lab has documented E7 facilitates degradation of an additional tumor suppressor,
PTPN14. PTPN14 degradation by E7 represses cell differentiation and induces translocation of YAP1, an
oncogenic transcription coactivator. The mechanism connecting PTPN14 to YAP1 regulation is unknown.
 My preliminary data indicates PTPN14 degradation by E7 suppresses YAP1 inhibition. Phosphorylation
of YAP1 at S127 coincides with YAP1 exclusion from the nucleus. YAP1 inhibition is induced by the Hippo
kinase cascade. I have shown PTPN14 loss is transformative and E7-mediated degradation promotes
dephosphorylation of YAP1 at S127. I have also shown PTPN14 induces YAP1 phosphorylation at S127. My
results show these effects in immortalized human foreskin keratinocytes and my goal is to apply my findings to
oral keratinocyte models. The specific aims of this proposal are to 1) determine if E7-mediated PTPN14
degradation promotes YAP1 dephosphorylation, stability and nuclear translocation in HPV positive
OPSCC and 2) determine the mechanism of YAP1 phosphorylation by PTPN14. In Aim 1 I will establish
effects of PTPN14 degradation in an oral keratinocyte cell model, quantifying phosphorylation levels of YAP1
and YAP1 stability by cycloheximide-chase experiments. I will test rescue of YAP1 inhibition on E7 knockdown
and also perform rescue experiments with an E7-binding mutant of PTPN14 to reestablish normal YAP1
regulation in HPV positive OPSCC cells. YAP1 localization in three-dimensional organoid cultures of OPSCC
cells will also be analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. In Aim 2 I will determine how PTPN14
promotes YAP1 S127 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear exclusion in oral keratinocytes. PTPN14
mutants containing single deletions of function domains will be expressed with YAP1 phosphorylation
quantified by immunoblot. I will determine interactors of PTPN14 important for its ability to induce YAP1
phosphorylation by performing BioID biotin labelling of proteins under conditions of phosphorylated YAP1 and
dephosphorylated YAP1."
10873950,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Despite extensive
studies, no FDA-approved therapy is available for any stage of ALD due to the limited understanding of disease
pathogenesis. Therefore, the unmet need to identify novel targets for developing effective therapeutics against
ALD is urgent. Alcohol not only alters hepatic lipid and bile acid metabolism but also disrupts the gut microbiome
and intestinal barrier function, which results in a leaky gut and bacterial translocation as well as activation of
systemic and hepatic inflammation. We have previously reported that conjugated bile acids activate sphingosine-
1 phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2), which further activates ERK1/2 and AKT. S1P is one of the most studied
sphingolipids and is synthesized from sphingosine by either sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) or SphK2. S1P can
regulate various fundamental cellular responses either as an intracellular signaling molecule or a ligand for five
GPCRs, S1PR1-5. SphK2-generated nuclear S1P is a potent natural inhibitor of histone deacetylases
(HDAC1/2). Activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) also has been identified as critical signaling
in ALD. A recent study reported that SphK2-mediated production of nuclear S1P in CD11b+ macrophages is a
strong inhibitor of STING and suppresses the inflammatory response in alveolar macrophages. We have
reported that SphK2-/- mice developed more severe fatty liver and hepatic injury in the NIAAA ALD mouse model.
Hepatic SphK2 expression levels were markedly reduced in both ALD cirrhotic patients and ALD mouse models.
Alcohol-feeding significantly increased intestinal permeability and bacterial translocation in SphK2-/- mice. Our
preliminary data further showed that 1) alcohol-feeding induced more severe liver injury in the global SphK2-/-
mice than hepatocyte-specific SphK2 knockout (SphK2Hep-/-); 2) intestinal epithelial cell-specific SphK2 knockout
(SphK2IEC-/-) mice were more prone to alcohol-induced liver injury compared to SphK2fl/fl mice; 3) RNAseq
analysis showed that chronic alcohol feeding significantly disrupted hepatic sphingolipid, fatty acid, and bile acid
metabolism and activated inflammatory and fibrotic responses; 4) deletion of SphK2 inhibited the growth of
intestinal organoids. Based on these key findings, we HYPOTHESIZE that disruption of SphK2/S1P-mediated
signaling pathways in the gut-liver axis plays a critical role in alcohol-induced liver injury. Two specific aims are
proposed to test the hypothesis. 1) To investigate the role and mechanisms of SphK2 in modulating hepatic lipid
metabolism and inflammatory response under the conditions of acute and chronic alcohol-induced stress. 2): To
define the role of SphK2 in modulating intestinal barrier function and to identify the cellular mechanisms by which
SphK2 modulates the gut liver axis in response to alcohol-induced stress. Accomplishing these specific aims will
significantly advance our current understanding of the tissue and cell-type-specific roles of SphK2/S1P-mediated
signaling pathways in ALD, which holds great promise for developing novel therapeutic interventions not only for
ALD but also for other related metabolic diseases."

The formation of functional neural circuits is critical for the proper functioning of the brain. To establish the
most efficient synaptic circuits, synaptic connections must be refined by neural activity during development.
However, the manner and molecules by which synapse refinement is regulated remain to be elucidated.
We have established mouse in vivo systems, in which neural activity can be conditionally controlled, and
showed that inactive synaptic connections are eliminated during development, but they are eliminated only
when there are other active connections with which to compete. This suggests that active connections send a
""punishment"" signal to inactive ones and instruct them to leave by triggering ""elimination"" signals within the
inactive synapses. Active connections are kept by the presence of ""stabilization"" signals. By performing various
screens, we have identified that the tyrosine kinases Pyk2 and JAK2 serve as ""elimination"" signals of inactive
synaptic connections during development. Pyk2 and JAK2 are turned on at inactive synapses in response to
""punishment"" signals sent from active synapses to drive inactive synapse elimination. Furthermore, we found
that a cell adhesion molecule SIRPa from postsynaptic neurons serves as a ""stabilization"" signal for active
synapses. Together, we propose that neurons calculate the balance between the ""elimination"" signals
(Pyk2/JAK2) and the ""stabilization"" signals (SIRPa) and determine whether to eliminate or stabilize their
synaptic connections. Interestingly, our recent preliminary data suggest that the elimination signals Pyk2 and
JAK2 have different roles, with Pyk2 in synapse elimination and JAK2 in axon elimination. Additionally, we
found that astrocytic ensheathing of synapses also plays important roles in synapse elimination.
To further uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying synapse refinement in vivo, we propose to:
Aim 1. Investigate the differential roles of Pyk2 and JAK2 for synapse and axon refinement and how SIRPa
regulates their activity. Aim 2: Visualize the elimination signals and their regulation of activity-dependent
synapse/axon refinement in vivo. Aim 3: Examine the role(s) of astrocytic sheaths in regulating the elimination
signals and synapse refinement.
Our project will molecularly delineate how neurons decide to establish functional synaptic connections in the
mammalian brain. Many forms of mental illness including autism and schizophrenia are associated with
abnormal alterations in synapse refinement. Thus, our studies should also yield novel insights into the etiology
and treatment of such disorders."

Telomeres are specialized DNA-protein complex that protect the ends of linear chromosomes. Mammalian
telomeres are composed of highly conserved tandem repeat sequences of duplexed (TTAGGG)n, ending with a
3’ single stranded (TTAGGG)n sequence that is bound to telomere specific proteins known as the shelterin
complex. In healthy somatic cells, progressive loss of telomeres results in cellular senescence. In 85% of cancer
cells, however telomeres are elongated by telomerase, while the remaining 15% of cancers use alternative
lengthening of telomeres (ALT). ALT pathway leads to overexpression of Telomeric repeat containing RNA
(TERRA), a long noncoding RNA that is transcribed from telomeres. TERRA is capable of trans annealing by
invading the telomeric duplex to form an R-loop (DNA-RNA hybrid) structure. Consistently, the accumulation of
R-loops is one of the hallmarks of ALT cancer. In addition, a recent study showed that R-loop formation is
promoted by Rad51 recombinase, but it is antagonized by RNase H1. Despite the mounting evidence of
TERRA’s critical role in telomere structure and function, our molecular understanding of TERRA is limited. Here,
I propose to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying TERRA recruitment and invasion into telomeres in
the context of shelterin proteins and the extent to which TERRA regulates telomere length in cells. Aim 1 will
probe TERRA-induced R-loop formation and the role of shelterin proteins. My preliminary results using single
molecule (sm) FRET show that TERRA trans anneals to telomeric DNA, and unexpectedly, the resulting R-loop
exhibits dynamic movement that is stabilized by TRF2. I also employed an sm-colocalization assay to measure
the efficiency for trans annealing of TERRA to telomeric DNA. My results from this assay show that the presence
of non-TERRA sequence, which represents the subtelomeric DNA, as well as the presence of G-quadruplex
(G4) telomeric overhang significantly enhances TERRA binding to telomeric duplex. Aim 2 will elucidate the
mechanism underlying TERRA recruitment and invasion by Rad51 and shelterin proteins. I present my
preliminary results using an sm-colocalization assay which show that RAD51-TERRA complex invades telomere
duplex more efficiently than TERRA alone. Aim 3 will measure telomere length as a function of TERRA levels in
ALT- and telomerase dependent cancer cells. Additionally, this aim will study the role of TRF2, POT1, Rad51,
RNaseH1 in TERRA regulation of telomeres in cells. Completion of these aims will provide a molecular
mechanism underpinning TERRA function in telomere protection and length regulation and thereby help develop
treatment for ALT positive cancers in which TERRA is upregulated."
11005686,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 The formation of the brain’s intricate neural network begins in embryogenesis. Axon guidance is a critical
developmental stage in which precise wiring of the central nervous system is achieved when axonal fibers
connect with specific target cells. Errors in axon guidance can result in wiring defects that are associated with
neurological disorders including epilepsy. The tips of axons have highly motile structures called growth cones
that can sense and respond to extracellular guidance cues to direct axon migration. Growth cones depend on
actin-based structures called filopodia to sense their surrounding environment and detect external guidance
cues. The formation of filopodia is dependent on the bundling of parallel actin filaments by actin cross-linking
proteins including Fascin1. During the guidance response, growth cone filopodia undergo remodeling, stabilizing
in the direction of attractive cues and collapsing in response to repulsive cues. I hypothesize that the loss of
Fascin1 in developing hippocampal neurons will result in erroneous axon guidance due to an inability to regulate
filopodia remodeling. The studies proposed here will utilize molecular, cellular biology, and imaging techniques
to study the role and regulation of Fascin1 in axon growth cones using cultured rat hippocampal neurons and an
in vivo Drosophila model.
 In Aim 1.1, the effects of Fascin1 depletion via CRISPR-Cas9 editing on filopodia extension, persistence,
and retraction will be studied. Three different axon guidance assays will be utilized to determine if Fascin1
depletion alters the ability of growth cones to undergo the guidance response. Aim 1.2 will study the
spatiotemporal dynamics of Fascin1 in growth cones of cultured rat hippocampal neurons undergoing guided
migration and the regulation of neuronal Fascin1 by protein kinase C (PKC). Previous work established that
phosphorylation of Ser-39 of Fascin1 by PKC abrogates Fascin1’s filament bundling ability and I hypothesize
that PKC regulates growth cone filopodia stability during axon guidance via this role. Aim 2 uses a Drosophila-
based approach to study the role of Fascin1 in axon guidance in vivo. Drosophila express an single ortholog of
mammalian Fascin1 called Singed and my preliminary studies indicate that the presence of Singed is required
for proper formation of the mushroom body, a neuronal structure that is dependent on axon guidance to form.
The studies proposed here will further the knowledge of cytoskeletal regulation during axon guidance which is
of importance due to the association of errors in axon guidance with neurological disorders, including epilepsy."
10746124,"Mutations in the skeletal muscle (SkM) sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release channel (Ryanodine Receptor
Type 1, RYR1), a component of the macromolecular complex that controls SkM excitation- contraction coupling
(ECC), are known genetic causes of Malignant Hyperthermia sensitivity (MHS) and Environmental Heat
Illness/Environmental Heat Stroke (EHI/EHS). MHS/EHS display incomplete penetrance, variable expressivity
and discordant inheritance. The reasons for this variability remain enigmatic. There are no effective treatments
for individuals with RYR1 pathogenic variants who experience life-threatening MHS/EHS episodes outside of
clinical settings (febrile pediatric patients, athletes, military personnel in hot environments).
Our goal is to develop approaches to prevent EHI-related deaths associated with RYR1 pathogenic variants.
We propose the existence of an environmentally sensitive, epigenetically regulated, feedback loop between
SkM and BAT that sensitizes MHS humans and mice to heat. Our specific hypotheses are: 1) Heat and
increased SkM activity drive metabolic and epigenetic changes in SkM and BAT to increase thermogenesis in
MHS mice. 2) Increased body temperature in MHS mice enhances SR Ca2+ leak, lactate production, AMPK
activation and metabolic changes in SkM, which, in turn, drive epigenetic modifications in SkM and BAT that
further enhance sensitivity to heat. 3) Heat-driven epigenetic changes are sex-biased and heritable and
contribute to discordance These hypotheses will be tested in 3 Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Define the roles
of heat, glycolysis, lactate, and adaptive thermogenesis in the enhanced sensitivity of MHS/EHS mice to heat.
Specific Aim 2: Define the role of RyR1 Ca2+ leak and AMPK activation in SKM on the enhanced sensitivity of
MHS mice to heat. Specific Aim 3: Determine if epigenetic changes driven by heat are heritable and sex biased.
Completion of these studies will elucidate fundamental molecular and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie
variability in EHS penetrance, expressivity, and genetic discordance, as well as provide new information on the
complex interplay of environment and genetics in these disorders. These data will lead to a new understanding
of the drivers of EHS episodes and, ultimately, to strategies for their prevention."
10873676,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation, pathological vascular remodeling is driven by macrophage
(Mφs) infiltration, and the mechanisms regulating macrophage-mediated AAA development remain undefined. In
the normal aortic wall, a balance exists between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which function to break
down the aortic wall, and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which prevent the actions of
MMPs on the aortic wall. However, in a pathologic setting, an imbalance occurs between the MMPs and TIMPs
in favor of MMP activity, resulting in AAA development. Although epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to
regulate Mφ phenotype in tissues, the regulation of these epigenetic pathways in aortic tissue remains unknown.
Our preliminary data identifies that SETDB2, a histone methyltransferase that selectively methylates histone 3
at lysine 9, decreases gene transcription and is increased in murine and human AAA Mφs. Further, we found
that JAK1/STAT3 signaling may regulate Setdb2 in aortic Mφs. Considering these findings, we hypothesize
that SETDB2 drives AAA formation through a JAK/STAT signaling pathway which shifts Mφs towards a
decreased TIMP production, favoring unregulated MMPs and AAA development. This hypothesis will be
investigated through the following specific aims: 1) Determine the JAK/STAT/SETDB2-mediated mechanism(s)
that regulate Mφ-specific Timp1-3 expression in human and murine AAAs 2) Examine the therapeutic efficacy
of Mφ-specific JAK/STAT/SETDB2 inhibition on AAA expansion. In this translational approach, our data will pave
the way for the development of promising preventative therapeutic agents aimed at cell-specific targeting of
epigenetic enzymes that mediate Mφ inflammation and thereby prevent AAA expansion and rupture."

 Intercalated disks (ICDs) connect the termini of adjacent cardiomyocytes (CMs) physically, electrically, and
chemically. The structural role of ICDs to preserve CM integrity in the face of billions of cycles of forceful con-
traction and relaxation is well appreciated; however, the function of ICDs as essential CM signaling hubs is
only now emerging. Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM) provides a unique window into the function of
ICDs and specifically desmosomes. ACM is a potentially lethal disorder characterized by high arrhythmia bur-
den, loss of contractile myocardium, and replacement by fibro-fatty tissue. Mutations of desmosome genes
(PKP2, DSG2, DSC2, DSP, JUP) occur in approximately half of ACM patients. Despite growing knowledge
about ACM disease pathogenesis, the mechanistic links between desmosome mutations and arrhythmias, my-
ocardial dysfunction, and fibrofatty replacement remain poorly understood.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to gain insights into the mechanisms by which desmosome mutations
cause arrhythmia and myocardial dysfunction; Our overarching hypothesis is that desmosomes are inte-
gral for maintaining normal cardiomyocyte homeostasis through both their structural and signaling
activities. ACM mutations disrupt these activities to cause both loss of structural integrity and aberrant
signaling. We will test these hypotheses through four parallel but complementary Specific Aims: (1) We will
examine cell composition and gene regulation of human ACM myocardium, using concurrent single nucleus
RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics (snMulti-seq) with massively parallel single molecule fluo-
rescent in situ hybridization (MERFISH); (2) We will use mosaic, adult, cardiomyocyte specific inactivation of
Dsp to probe the cell autonomous functions of desmosomes. This model will be studied using snMulti-seq and
MERFISH, followed by interrogation of key predicted regulators using in vivo gain- and loss-of-function ap-
proaches; (3) Using proximity proteomics of ICD component N-cadherin, we identified novel ICD components
and ICD components that are altered by Dsp ablation. We will use in vivo gain- and loss-of-function ap-
proaches to study the function of selected candidates identified by this screen; (4) Define the contributions of
WNT and GSK3 signaling to ACM phenotypes in DSP mutant hiPSC-CMs. Using genetic approaches in bioen-
gineered hiPSC-CMs, we will dissect the involvement of GSK3 and WNT signaling to ACM pathogenesis.
 Impact: This proposal will advance our understanding of the function of desmosomes and ICDs in CM
homeostasis and the molecular pathogenesis of ACM. This knowledge will accelerate efforts to develop
targeted ACM therapies."

Animals can exhibit goal-directed behaviors in novel environments, despite limited experience
with them. How does the brain make and use inferences about the underlying statistics and
generative structure of environments to guide behavior? The field of reinforcement learning refers
to this capacity as “model-based” reasoning, meaning that it relies on an internal model of the
structure of the world. Critically, this internal model can be used to flexibly estimate the best
actions by mental simulation or planning, without direct experience. In contrast, in “model-free”
reinforcement learning, an agent chooses the best action based on direct experience, without
explicit knowledge of the underlying sequential transition structure of a task or environment.
 Model-based and model-free mechanisms coexist in the brain and are mediated by distinct
circuits, although the neural circuit mechanisms by which the brain arbitrates between these
decision systems remains unknown. Theoretical and behavioral studies suggest that human
brains use the system that yields value estimates with the lowest uncertainty. The lateral
orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) is a compelling candidate to perform arbitration because while it is
implicated in model-based reasoning, for instance by enabling inferences about hidden task
states, it lies upstream of the dorsal striatum, which is critical for both model-based and model-
free decision making. Intriguingly, we have found that lOFC neurons project exclusively to the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a region critical for model-free behavior, and not the dorsomedial
striatum (DMS), which is critical for model-based behavior. We hypothesize that projection
specific neural circuits in lOFC arbitrate between these systems by suppressing the model-free
system.
 I will use state-of-the-art viral, electrophysiological, and computational methods to
determine whether DLS-projecting lOFC neurons mediate uncertainty-based arbitration between
decision-making systems (Aim 1) and characterize the underlying circuit logic that supports
arbitration (Aim 2). By optogenetically tagging DLS-projecting lOFC neurons I will selectively
characterize and perturb their activity while monitoring the behavioral strategy rats use in a task
with latent structure. To determine how arbitration is instantiated in the dorsal striatum I will
optogenetically activate OFC→DLS neurons while recording from different genetic cell types in
the striatum, in vivo and in vitro. We predict that OFC→DLS neurons enable model-based
behavior by activating inhibitory interneurons to suppress the DLS and the model-free system."

Accurate protein transport in the secretory pathway is vital for cell function and growth. Our research
program is focused on coat-dependent sorting mechanisms that drive protein trafficking between the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. Nascent secretory proteins are translated at the ER and
then fully folded proteins are selectively packaged into COPII coated vesicles for anterograde transport to
the Golgi complex. This forward pathway is balanced by retrograde transport from the Golgi, which
selectively returns proteins to the ER in COPI coated vesicles. To ensure delivery of only folded secretory
proteins, a process known as ER quality control largely retains nascent proteins in the ER until correctly
folded or targets terminally misfolded proteins for degradation. The coordinated mechanisms that maintain
organelle identity, advance folded biosynthetic cargo and retain misfolded proteins are not well understood.
We identified a set of transmembrane cargo receptors that function in coat-dependent sorting and quality
control in the early secretory pathway. This research plan will address key questions on how cargo receptors
recognize their clients and catalyze net directional traffic of proteins. In the past funding period, we
characterized the Erv41-Erv46 complex as a retrograde receptor that retrieves ER-resident proteins through
the activity of a conserved thioredoxin-like domain in Erv46. Our recent findings indicate the Erv41-Erv46
receptor also retrieves misfolded secretory proteins that have exited the ER. The specific aims of this
proposal will test the molecular model that the Erv46 subunit recognizes hydrophobic features displayed by
escaped cargo in the low pH environment of Golgi compartments. After return to the ER, redox activity on
the Erv46 thioredoxin-like domain releases bound cargo from the receptor at neutral pH. Through these
mechanisms, pH and redox gradients drive efficient protein sorting in the early secretory pathway. This
model will be tested in the following experimental aims. Aim 1: Define the molecular mechanisms of Erv41-
Erv46 cargo binding at reduced pH of the Golgi compartment. Aim 2: Determine the mechanism by which
cargo is efficiently released from Erv41-Erv46 in the ER. Aim 3: Test the model that Erv41-Erv46 recognizes
and binds directly to misfolded cargo for active retrieval to the ER. We will rigorously test our models by
exploiting iterative genetic, cellular and biochemical approaches to monitor protein function in vivo, in cell
free assays and in reconstitution experiments with purified factors. Defining the molecular mechanisms that
underlie conserved protein sorting processes will provide fundamental insights on cellular organization and
contribute to treatments for human diseases connected to secretory pathway function."

The burden of non-communicable diseases, especially hematological malignancies and cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs), is rising in Africa. Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) is an age-related risk factor
for all-cause mortality, blood cancer and CVDs, prompting huge interests in the development of drugs targeting
CHIP mutations to intercept progression to malignancies. However, individuals of African descent are a minority
in these CHIP studies hence the need to understand the spectrum and frequency of CHIP variants in African
populations. My long-term research goal is to generate a pan-African database of somatic mutations
associated with the risk of developing myeloid leukemia. Recent genome-wide association analyses have
identified germline loci predisposing individuals to increased risk of CHIP acquisition. These include the
rs144418061 intergenic variant near TET2 found only in African-ancestry populations. The central hypothesis is
that there is a high burden of CHIP variants in normal-aging Africans compared to age-matched healthy
Caucasians. To address this, I propose the following specific aims: Aim 1 determines the frequency of CHIP
mutations in a cohort of clinically healthy Nigerians. Whole blood samples from healthy Nigerian volunteers
≥40 years will be collected and error-corrected targeted sequencing will be carried out to genotype 54 genes
known to be frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies. Aim 2 describes temporal trends and clinical
outcomes of CHIP acquisition over a three-year period. Each subject will be followed up for three years and
the temporal dynamics of CHIP clonal dominance over the period will be determined. In addition, hematological
changes correlating with the CHIP architecture will be described. It is suspected that varying behavioral and
clinical states will impact the rate of CHIP progression in different individuals. Aim 3 will determine the
inflammatory markers associated with CHIP burden in the study population. Here, Luminex-based Human
Cytokine/Chemokine assay will be adopted to tease out inflammatory signals correlating with CHIP burden. This
K43 project will generate information on CHIP mutations in normal-aging Nigerians. This aligns with the study I
am currently leading on CHIP burden in Nigerians with varying comorbidities. My career development goal of
this K43 application is to gain skills on error-corrected sequencing, variant calling as well as data analysis and
generate sufficient data for a competitive hypothesis-driven R01 submission by the fifth year of this award. This
will enable me to build research capacity for blood cancer genetics in Nigeria and establish my independence
as an Africa-based medical geneticist. My training and research activities will benefit from a strong committee of
mentors comprising established US and Africa-based researchers in hematology, population genetics,
bioinformatics and computational analysis. I will maximize my time at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research
carrying out hematological analysis and sequencing while taking advantage of hands-on training activities,
important data science and research leadership courses available at the National Institutes of Health."
10828391,"Project Summary / Abstract
Rapid and reliable access to synthetically-derived chemical structures plays an essential role in many aspects
of biomedical research. The underlying objective of this proposal is to provide fundamentally new strategies for
highly selective bond formations that will enable more rapid and efficient access to biologically active
compounds of potential therapeutic value. A suite of new reactions will be developed that rely on the boron-
catalyzed coupling of organofluorine and organosilane substrates. Glycosylation reactions that rely on this
reactivity paradigm will be developed in concert with catalyst design, mechanistic study, and computational
evaluation. Robust methods that enable efficient assembly of glycosidic bonds with high degrees of
stereocontrol and broad functional group tolerance will allow access to any desired stereochemical outcome
while allowing a platform for iterative assembly of complex oligosaccharides. New late transition metal-
catalyzed processes will be developed utilizing the framework of connecting organofluorine with organosilane
substrates using boron co-catalysis. Methods where remote complexation of fluorine allows leaving groups to
be activated on demand will developed as a general strategy for applications in carbohydrate chemistry and in
carbon-carbon bond-forming methodology. Following the above focus on the development of new catalytic
methods, approaches to the efficient assembly of glycosylated structures will be pursued to provide new
methods for accessing novel chemical probes and potential therapeutic agents. This component will include
developing new strategies for accessing rare carbohydrates and for the stereoselective glycodiversification of
peptides, natural products, and complex synthetic intermediates. Methods for tailoring complex naturally
occurring and synthetic structures will include derivatization of existing hydroxyl functionality or biocatalytic
functionalization of unactivated C-H bonds. These capabilities will serve as a foundation for a broad array of
collaborative studies including the discovery of new antimicrobial and anticancer therapeutic agents and new
chemical probes to provide insight into diverse biological questions such as mechanisms of transcriptional
activation and enzymatic degradation of host and dietary oligosaccharides. The synthetic approaches
developed represent a merger of rarely combined fields of chemistry and biology: main group element
catalysis, transition metal catalysis, carbohydrate chemistry, and biocatalysis. The unique multidisciplinary
perspective allows examination of strategies that cannot be addressed by conventional approaches. The
improved entries to biomedically important structures made possible by this research will enable their biological
function and therapeutic potential to be more efficiently studied."

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) affects more than 200,000 adults each year in the United
States and carries a high mortality risk. Heterogeneity in susceptibility and outcomes are prominent features of
ARDS, and improved understanding of the genetic underpinnings of ARDS would advance our ability to define
ARDS subphenotypes, predict disease risk, and identify new therapeutic targets: a critical challenge identified
in the NHLBI’s most recent Strategic Vision plan. This K01 proposal will provide Dr. V. Eric Kerchberger, MD
with critical training for his long-term career goal of bringing precision medicine to critical care by applying his
expertise in biomedical informatics and genetic analysis to leverage the power of large-scale electronic health
record (EHR) databases and DNA biobanks. The project will be completed under the guidance of primary
mentor Lorraine B. Ware, MD and co-mentor Wei-Qi Wei, MD, PhD, and a research advisory committee of
experts in precision medicine, biomedical informatics, and functional genomics. By integrating existing GWAS-
level genotyping with PrediXcan, an advanced functional genomics framework, this project will quantify tissue-
specific gene expression levels for lung tissue and immune cells in 3,100 critically ill adults enrolled in the
Validating Acute Lung Injury Markers for Diagnosis (VALID) Study cohort. Then, leveraging Dr. Kerchberger’s
expertise in EHR phenotyping, we will validate the genetic findings from VALID in an independent sample of
ARDS patients from BioVU, Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s large de-identified DNA biobank. This
mentored research project has three specific aims: Aim 1: Test the association between genetic regulation of
gene expression and ARDS susceptibility in at-risk adults. Aim 2: Test the association between genetic
regulation of gene expression and patient-centered outcomes in ARDS. Aim 3: Use advanced phenotyping
methods to identify ARDS patients and at-risk controls in BioVU, and replicate gene expression associations
identified in VALID.
Completion of these studies will yield novel methods to identify ARDS patients and at-risk controls from large
EHR databases, and advance our understanding of tissue-specific gene expression in ARDS, bridging the gap
between genetics and biology. The knowledge gained from this proposal will provide vital preliminary data for
Dr. Kerchberger to design and execute future R01 proposals to study functional genomics in ARDS using NIH-
supported EHR biobanks such as the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network and the NIH All of
Us Project. Furthermore, Dr. Kerchberger will gain new skills in the clinical translation of functional genomics
and advanced EHR phenotyping, forming the foundation for Dr. Kerchberger to independently lead
collaborative teams of clinicians, geneticists, and data scientists to conduct large EHR-based studies of critical
illness syndromes that will improve risk prediction, identify novel disease subtypes using genetic risk, and
ultimately bring precision medicine to the critically ill patient."
10823273,"Although preventable, dental disease is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States
and exacts a substantial personal and societal toll. It is closely linked to low oral health literacy and poor oral
hygiene behaviors (OHBs). Using the high prevalence and burden of dental disease as a proxy, there is a large
gap between knowledge about quality oral hygiene routines and what is practiced by individuals. The causes
are many but ultimately distill down to a systemic failure to communicate oral hygiene instructions (OHIs)
effectively or to engage and motivate patients in their own oral self-care.
 To address the know-do gap, we begin by distilling desired brushing behaviors into a simple 2x2x4 OHI
(brushing 2 times a day, for 2 minutes each time, all 4 dental quadrants). We will leverage tracking capabilities
of our innovative eBrush platform to remotely monitor tooth-brushing activities in home settings. Using the 2x2x4
OHI and eBrush as foundational elements, we will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of personalized Digital
Oral Health Interventions (DOHI) for promoting ideal OHBs in at-risk individuals. In the UG3 phase, we will build
out the technologic infrastructure for collecting brushing data and delivering the DOHI. Then, we will engage
target end-users in the co-design of an app for oral self-care and establish the usability and feasibility of the
system. In the UH3 phase, we will build and validate computational models to infer the quality of OHBs from
brushing data and personalize the DOHI. Using a cohort of 130, we will conduct a 10-week Micro-Randomized
Trial to optimize the adaptive tailoring of engagement strategies. Finally, we will evaluate effectiveness of the
computationally-driven, adaptive DOHI in promoting sustained engagement in the 2x2x4 OHB. We hypothesize
that a dynamic and personalized DOHI will be more effective than traditional, static, clinician-delivered OHI in
improving oral health and adherence to 2x2x4 OHBs. We will test our hypothesis through a 6-month, pragmatic,
randomized, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Eligible adults from safety-net dental clinics will be equipped
with an electronic toothbrush and the smartphone app for tracking brushing data. After a run-in period (4 weeks)
to ensure technical proficiency and establish baseline OHBs, 260 at-risk subjects will receive a clinician-delivered
2x2x4 OHI and randomized to either: (a) an intervention arm where subjects receive ongoing, personalized
DOHIs at opportune times; or (b) a control arm where subjects lack such feedback. Subjects will be followed for
20 weeks. Trained dental examiners will conduct assessments at each visit (baseline, randomization and after
20 weeks). Primary outcomes are changes in dental health from baseline (Modified Gingival Index and Plaque
Index). Secondary outcome is the quality of adherence to the 2x2x4 OHI. We will explore subject-level features
that predict the magnitude of response to the DOHI. Our team science approach presents a potentially paradigm
shifting opportunity to leverage the growing ubiquity and reach of digital technologies to activate, educate, and
engage patients in optimal oral health self-care in ways and at a scale previously unimaginable."

 RNA polymerase (RNAP) pausing and termination are important components of gene expression in all
organisms. NusA and NusG are two general transcription elongation factors that are capable of stimulating
pausing and termination in bacteria. Pausing allows synchronization of the position of RNAP with RNA folding
and/or regulatory factor binding. Using a method that combines nascent elongating transcript sequencing with
RNase I digestion (RNET-seq), it was determined that NusG-dependent pausing occurs at 1,600 sites throughout
the B. subtilis genome. ~25% of these pause sites are in 5'UTRs, and the role that several of these 5'UTR pauses
have in regulating downstream gene expression will be examined. The other 75% of the pause sites are in open
reading frames and the possibility that some of these pauses are involved in maintaining coupling of transcription
and translation will be tested. The structural basis for NusG-dependent pausing will also be investigated using
cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM). The in vivo roles of NusA and NusG in pausing have not been explored in
E. coli because both proteins are essential. The recent ability to deplete NusA and NusG will be exploited to
examine NusA-dependent and NusG-dependent pausing in E. coli using RNET-seq. Promoter proximal pausing
is a distinct pausing mechanism that is mediated by σ factor interaction with -10 promoter elements or -10-like
sequences in the DNA. These backtracked pauses are relieved by Gre factors that stimulate the RNA cleavage
activity of RNAP. Following cleavage, the RNA 3' end becomes properly aligned in the active site such that
elongation can resume. The prevalence of σA-dependent promoter proximal pausing in B. subtilis, as well as the
role that GreA plays in this process, will be investigated using RNET-seq.
 Intrinsic and Rho-dependent termination are generally thought to occur via two distinct and non-overlapping
mechanisms. Intrinsic terminators consist of an RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract. Using a 3' end-mapping
strategy (Term-seq) it was shown that that NusA and NusG function as general intrinsic termination factors in B.
subtilis. NusA-dependent terminators have weak RNA hairpins and/or poor U-tracts, whereas NusG-dependent
terminators require NusG-dependent pausing to provide sufficient time for folding of hairpins with weak A-U base
pairs at the bottom of the stem. In Rho-dependent termination, Rho promotes transcript release when it catches
up to paused RNAP. E. coli NusG participates in some Rho-dependent termination events by serving as a bridge
between RNAP and Rho. Of particular interest, B. subtilis Rho functions as a third intrinsic termination factor, in
stark contrast to the accepted view that Rho only participates in canonical Rho-dependent termination. The
mechanism of Rho-dependent intrinsic termination, and the potential role of NusA or NusG in this process, will
be explored. In addition, Term-seq will be used to perform a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis to determine
the roles of NusA, NusG and Rho on termination throughout the E. coli genome. Selected terminators will then
be examined in vitro."

Cigarette smoking accounts for 1 in 5 preventable deaths in the United States. Sexual and gender minorities
(SGM) are at higher risk of cigarette smoking and tobacco-related deaths. Preliminary evidence indicates that
sexual minorities have higher eligibility rates for low dose computed tomography (LDCT), a reliable screening
test that reduces the risk of lung cancer mortality caused by tobacco smoking. Recently, the age and smoking
pack years were reduced in the eligibility guidelines, which determine who qualifies for LDCT screening. This
led to an increase in the number of people who were eligible, but no work on differences by sexuality or gender
identity comparing the new and old criteria has been conducted. One possible cause of SGM individuals
having higher eligibility rates is the number of risk factors SGM individuals experience at the individual,
interpersonal, community, and policy levels based on the social ecological model. However, individual national
data sets do not contain enough individuals that identify as SGM to make inferences about possible risk factors
and the corresponding high LDCT eligibility for SGM individuals. To improve estimates and identity potential
disparities and risk factors among SGM individuals for LDCT eligibility, one promising option is to merge data
from multiple national data sources. Additionally, there is a need to determine whether SGM individuals who
are eligible for LDCT are smoking at a higher rate compared to heterosexual and cisgender individuals,
especially over time. Overall, I have three main aims: 1) Merge four nationally representative data sets
together, and compare these methods of merging to generate better estimates of cigarette smoking and LDCT
eligibility for SGM individuals.; 2) Compare trends in the new and old LDCT screening eligibility criteria over
time to understand how many people are eligible and how SGM individuals compare to their cisgender and
heterosexual counterparts; and 3) Guided by the social ecological model, identify the risk factors associated
with LDCT eligibility for SGM individuals. To address these aims, state-of-the-art techniques for merging data,
complex survey analysis using longitudinal and multi-year cross-sectional data, and structural equation
modeling will be used under the mentorship of Drs. West and McCabe to understand the effects multiple levels
of the social ecological model have on LDCT eligibility. Upon completion of the aims, the papers,
presentations, and reports will enhance my methodological and substantive training and advance multiple
fields of research. In the survey methodology field, I will compare methods of data merging for small
subpopulations, understand measurement differences, and improve estimates for SGM individuals. In the
public health realm, I will expand our understanding of possible differences between SGM, heterosexual, and
cis-gender individuals in LDCT eligibility, lung cancer, and lung conditions, and I will aim to understand the
effects of multiple levels of the social ecological model on SGM individuals and their LDCT eligibility."
10840794,"PROJECT SUMMARY The highly-organized packing of eukaryotic genetic material as chromatin fibers in three-
dimensional space is critical for proper gene expression and genome maintenance. Of note are topologically-
associated domains (TADs) containing neighborhoods of insulated chromatin loop regions bound by clustered
cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) homodimers. The integrity and maintenance of these insulated
neighborhoods are important as disruptions to loop structure can result in gene misregulation and proto-
oncogene activation. However, current biochemical tools are insufficiently developed to study questions
concerning the mechanism of neighborhood formation, regulation and dynamics. Thus, we need molecular tools
that enable real-time, high-resolution analysis with minimal pertubation on cellular function.
 This proposal will combine molecular biology tools with the knowledge of photochemistry to develop
an optogenetic tool for labeling the molecular interactome within live cells. A genetically-encodable
photocatalytic protein (SOPP) is used to generate reactive intermediates from a biotin-appended probe that in
turn, covalently tag biomolecular interactions within radial distance of protein localization. Preliminary
experiments nuclear proteins can be labeled with high temporal specificity using short irradiation times. I
anticipate that this method will be applied towards mapping the protein interactomes of other organelles, using
quantitative proteomic data as further confirmation of this method. Conditional systems for proximity labeling
using split-SOPP (sSOPP) will be developed for proximity-gated microenvironment mapping. Finally, SOPP-
activatable chemical probes with different reactivities and radial labeling radius will be synthesized and validated.
 Using this new optogenetic proximity labeling tool, the three-dimensional architecture of chromatin will be
mapped using nuclease dead Cas9 (dCas9)-SOPP fusions guided to genomic sites using defined signal guide
RNAs (sgRNAs). SOPP-CTCF and SOPP-cohesin fusions will be used to map multisite interactions. This
approach should provide insight into the dynamics of factors that engage genes within insulated regions.
Additionally, using the sSOPP approach for proximity-gated CTCF-cohesin labeling will provide a more accurate
picture of loop region interactomics. Lastly, the dCas9-SOPP technology will be used to study the differences in
the interactome of intact and disrupted proto-oncogene containing loops, especially with regard to the factors
involved in gene regulation. As a more holistic approach to mapping molecular interatomics, an orthogonal
nucleic acid labeling method will be adapted to this workflow to create a multiplexed system capable of mapping
both protein and nucleic acid chromatin neighborhood loop interactomes in live cells.
 Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a new optogenetic tool that will be used
by the broader epigenetics community to understand the causative impacts of higher-order
chromosomal architecture on gene regulation, and their role in cancer development and progression."

Hypertension disparities persist and are particularly worst in African Americans (AA). Suboptimal hypertension
self-management, including adherence to medication-taking of antihypertensives remains a major public health
concern. Poor adherence to antihypertensive medications is estimated to occur in 43-78% of patients, with
approximately 50% discontinuation after a year, and worse in AA. Even more alarming, AA older adults may not
be prescribe evidence-based practice treatment regimens known to more efficient in the AA population. There
is a critical need for behavioral approaches and long-term self-management strategies that are feasible,
replicable, and scalable. Mobile Health (mHealth) technologies (mobile phone applications [app], text, video
messaging) are promising tools to facilitate behavioral change and sustain self-management.
 While reports support using mHealth technologies for the management of chronic diseases have grown,
there is limited data specific to AA older adults. Other gaps identified in the literature regarding mHealth
technology include the lack of being theoretically driven, the clinical/epidemiologic investigations are primarily
conducted outside of the U.S. limiting generalizability, and the lack of evidence on long-term sustainability and
impact on clinically relevant health outcomes. This R01 application, OPtimizing Technology to Improve
Medication Adherence and BP Control (OPTIMA-BP) is testing a technology-based interventions compared to
a wait-listed control (WL) in a prospective, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. OPTIMA-BP includes
evidenced-based strategies, web-based education, and behavioral skills training to use a theoretically driven
mHealth medication management app in conjunction with a guideline directed treatment regimen and nurse
counseling.
 The aims of this study are: [1] To test the effects of OPTIMA-BP vs. WL on systolic BP and serum high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) in AA older adults with hypertension in a prospective, RCT format; and [2]
To test if the attitudinal/knowledge mechanisms of self-management (hypertension knowledge, self-efficacy,
perceived social support) and proximal behavioral target mechanisms (taking medications to reduce systolic BP,
diet, exercise) mediate OPTIMA-BP vs. WL’s impact on the primary and secondary outcomes (systolic BP,
diastolic BP, health-related quality of life, serum lipids, and at least 62% of the sample with BP <130/80 mmHg)
over a 12-month time period. A secondary aim of this study will assess OPTIMA-BP and WL’s impact on the
primary and secondary outcomes while controlling for covariates/contextual variables such as age and gender.
A supplemental and complementary feature of this proposal is the qualitative evaluation to confirm self-
management barriers and perceived strengths or limitations of the intervention, which will inform future
refinements should these RCT findings be positive."
10757325,"Project Summary/Abstract
Youth resilience is best conceptualized as multidimensional1–3 and dynamic,4–6 such that individuals may
demonstrate changes in academic, social, or psychiatric resilience over time. Despite this broad consensus,
the majority of empirical work on resilience has been cross-sectional and tends to focus on a single domain of
resilience (e.g., psychiatric resilience). This has notably limited the field’s understanding of the development of
resilience over time, including the trajectories that best characterize resilience, the specific biological
mechanisms underlying those trajectories, and whether domains of resilience follow similar or disparate
developmental courses. The current F31 proposal will address these gaps in the literature by examining the
developmental etiology of youth resilience to neighborhood adversity by using a large multi-informant and
multi-wave dataset of twins exposed to substantial levels of neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., poverty,
community violence). Specific Aim 1 will employ growth mixture models to group individuals based on their
domain-specific patterns of resilience (i.e., academic, social, psychiatric) across three time points: middle
childhood, early adolescence, and late adolescence; the first study of its kind. Specific Aim 2 will identify
longitudinally-predictive biomarkers of resilience trajectories through the first methylome wide association study
(MWAS) of resilience development. To eliminate genetic confounds prominent in human epigenetic studies, I
will also include discordant monozygotic twin difference analyses. By illuminating the developmental etiology of
resilience, these findings should inform policy and intervention efforts for youth in disadvantaged neighborhood
contexts.
To facilitate the completion of these aims, the proposed NRSA fellowship will provide training in 1) longitudinal
statistical methods, 2) advanced epigenetic analytics, 3) the development of an integrated, conceptual theory
of the development of resilience (essential for understanding the results for scientific aims 1 and 2 given the
dearth of relevant literature), 4) the preparation of grants and manuscripts, and 5) the ethical conduct of
research. These five areas of training will significantly further my development as an independent
interdisciplinary researcher and ultimately facilitate my goal of creating a program of research focused on the
study of youth resilience within a developmentally, genetically, and environmentally informed context."
10832979,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) is a form of cancer most prevalent in children under four years old.
Targeted AMKL-specific treatment options are limited, and survival rates remain variable. A major obstacle to
improving therapy options for AMKL is the dearth of data regarding the mechanisms that contribute to AMKL
leukemogenesis. Of several known causative genomic alterations in AMKL, the t(1;22) translocation, which
encodes the RBM15-MKL1 (RM) fusion protein, is considered a neonatal mutation as it is always diagnosed in
children younger than 6 months old. RNA-binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) is required for recruitment to RNA
of the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) writer complex and subsequent epitranscriptomic modification of the
transcripts. Megakaryoblastic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is a transcriptional coactivator and is involved in gene
expression and megakaryocyte maturation. RM retains all functional domains of both proteins and, despite our
understanding of these proteins, the properties of RM itself remain poorly understood. The goal of this proposal
is to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which RBM15’s association with RNA in the context of the RM
fusion protein contributes to leukemogenesis. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that RM alters
gene expression via binding to RNA and promoting modification of the epitranscriptome which promotes
oncogenesis via aberrant Wnt signalling. To test this hypothesis, two Aims are proposed. The first Aim is to
identify RNAs bound and m6A modified by RM using enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation
sequencing techniques. This will determine which transcripts are targeted by RM and which adenosine residues
are modified following RM binding, and functional analysis will determine pathways important to leukemogenesis.
Computational integration with RNA-seq will provide insight into the fate of RNAs targeted by the RM fusion
protein in contrast to control RBM15. The second Aim is to investigate the role of candidate proteins in RM-
mediated leukemogenesis by knocking down select candidates in a physiologically relevant murine
megakaryoblastic cell line model. In vitro and in vivo assessment of leukemogenesis will determine the
requirement of these candidates for the survival of leukemia cells in vitro and for maintenance of disease in vivo.
These experiments will provide insight into the transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic effects of RM that are critical
to the mechanistic function of the fusion protein. A better understanding of the mechanisms driving RM-mediated
AMKL will significantly broaden knowledge of AMKL leukemogenesis and provide potential novel therapeutic
avenues to improve outcomes and survival rates of neonates with this disease."

 Immune dysfunction and imbalances in synaptic pruning have been implicated as contributing factors to
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Recent studies
suggest that dysregulation of complement may be involved. Complement deposits on neuronal synapses to
mediate synaptic pruning by microglia and refine neural circuits during critical windows of brain development.
Complement can also aberrantly tag synapses for removal in inflammatory and neurodegenerative
diseases. Self-directed complement activity is usually held in check by complement regulatory proteins
expressed on cell membranes. Nevertheless, the role of complement inhibitors has been largely ignored in
studies of complement-mediated synaptic pruning and is the subject of this grant. Our preliminary data shows
that the Sez6 family (consisting of Sez6, Sez6L, and Sez6L2) are novel, complement inhibitors. Sez6 family
members are highly expressed by neurons during development and in adulthood. Sez6 proteins have been
shown to modulate synapse numbers, synaptic plasticity, and dendrite morphology. Genetic loss of Sez6
genes results in impaired cognition and motor deficits. Sez6 family members also have genetic connections to
autism, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, epilepsy, and bipolar disorder. We propose that Sez6 proteins
modulate synapse numbers and brain development by putting the brakes on complement-mediated synaptic
pruning by microglia. Furthermore, disruptions in this process may contribute to the pathogenesis of
neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD. We will investigate mechanisms of complement regulation by
Sez6 family members and whether these are disrupted by missense mutations previously identifed in ASD
patients. Then will determine if Sez6 family genetic knockout phenotypes are complement-dependent and/or
exacerbated by the inflammatory environment of maternal immune activation. Finally, we will investigate
whether neuronal activity and the endocytic motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of Sez6 proteins differentially
place Sez6 proteins and their complement inhibitory function on the cell surface of active synapses as opposed
to weak and inappropriate synapses. This would couple the functional strength of specific neuronal
connections to synapses that can be tagged and removed by complement-mediated pruning. This research
program will provide insight into the mechanisms of how Sez6 proteins are protective factors against excessive
complement-mediated pruning by microglia that may be especially relevant to the pathogenesis of various
neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD."
10818616,"Project Summary
Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a fundamental feature of asthma and is the hallmark of the disease in
the majority of patients with asthma. Our lab has been working to understand the underlying
immunopathogenesis of AHR and recently discovered using three-dimensional quantitative imaging of the
airway wall that in asthma there is a shift in mast cells (MC)s from the submucosa to the airway epithelium that
is closely related to the severity of AHR as well as features of type-2 (T2) inflammation. This shift is critical as
we identified a IL-33 dependent feed-forward loop in which MCs regulate the expression of epithelial IL-33
(IL33), indicating that MCs serve not only as effector cells but also regulate T2 inflammation through IL-33.
This feed-forward loop is accentuated in airway epithelial cells (AEC)s from individuals with asthma indicating
that the unique microenvironment that is established by the epithelium in asthma is critical for the propagation
of AHR and T2 inflammation through this feed-forward interaction between MCs and the airway epithelium.
The major goals of this research are to identify the underlying basis for MC infiltration of the airway
epithelium, the molecular details of this interaction between MCs and primary AECs from individuals
with asthma and the in vivo relevance of the IL-33-MC-axis using selected murine models of asthma.
Given that mature MCs arise from circulating progenitors, we hypothesize that the number of MC progenitors
(MCP)s in the airways is increased in asthma, and these cells function in concert with the susceptible airway
epithelium to orchestrate T2 inflammation. We will directly address our hypothesis by using airway samples
and primary AECs from individuals with and without asthma and/or allergic sensitization, combined with AEC-
MC coculture models, and murine models of asthma in which we examine the function of the IL-33-MC-axis. In
specific aim 1, we investigate the differences in the number and proliferation potential of MCPs in the airways
and peripheral blood of subjects with asthma and AHR, relative to non-asthmatic control subjects with and
without allergic sensitization. We further examine the expansion of MCPs in the airways following allergen
challenge in individuals with asthma. In specific aim 2, we determine how the asthmatic airway epithelium
interacts with MCs to regulate T2 inflammation, using an ex vivo model of primary AECs from subjects with and
without asthma to examine this feed-forward mechanism. In specific aim 3, we use selective IL-33 receptor
deletion in MCs in an in vivo model to understand how IL-33 acts through MCs to regulate the development of
T2 inflammation and AHR. The completion of these studies using airway samples, phenotyped AECs, and
sophisticated murine models will move the field forward through a better understanding of the interplay
between AECs and intraepithelial MCs that serve to regulate AHR and the T2 immune response."
10818626,"The impact of acute airway inflammation is mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα),
and underlies a number of respiratory diseases. A fundamental question is why are some
individuals more susceptible than others to the negative impact of airway inflammation. We will
explore a novel homeostatic mechanism, which protects airway smooth muscle (hASM) cells from
the negative impact of inflammation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and
protein unfolding (endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress). We believe that a failure in this homeostatic
mechanism leads to increased ROS formation thereby exacerbating oxidative and ER stress.
Overall Hypothesis: TNFα-induced ROS formation and protein unfolding activates the
pIRE1α/XBP1s ER stress pathway in hASM, which initiates a homeostatic response directed
towards increasing mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial volume density to reduce O2
consumption and ROS formation by individual mitochondrion, while still meeting the increase in
ATP demand – sharing the energetic load across mitochondria. Furthermore, reduced Mfn2
disrupts mitochondrial tethering to the ER, thereby decreasing mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and
maximum respiratory capacity of mitochondria.
Aim 1: TNFα-induced activation of pIRE1α/XBP1s ER stress pathway increases mitochondrial
volume density and reduces O2 consumption and ROS formation per mitochondrion.
 In hASM cells, the downstream impact of TNFα-induced activation of the pIRE1α/XBP1s ER
stress pathway will be explored using transfection of a non-phosphorylatable IRE1α mutant
plasmid (DP-IRE1α) or an unspliceable XBP1 (uXBP1) mRNA. In addition, we will examine the
effects of siRNA knockdown of PGC1α and Mfn2 overexpression on TNFα-induced changes in
mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial volume density, O2 consumption and ROS formation.
Aim 2: TNFα-induced reduction in Mfn2 disrupts mitochondrial tethering to ER, decreases
mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and reduces maximum respiratory capacity of mitochondria.
 In hASM cells, we will examine the impact of DP-IRE1α or uXBP1 mRNA transfection and
siRNA Mfn2 knockdown on TNFα-induced disruption of mitochondrial/ ER tethering, decreased
mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and reduced maximum respiratory capacity of mitochondria.
Aim 3: The impact of TNFα on activation of the pIRE1α/XBP1s ER stress pathway and
downstream effects are mitigated by ROS scavenging and chemical chaperone treatment.
 In hASM cells, the mitigating effects of ROS scavenging and chemical chaperone treatment
on TNFα-induced activation of the pIRE1α/XBP1s ER stress pathway will be examined."

and public health practitioners. Its mission is to catalyze multidirectional translation of research between 
diverse model systems, population-based studies, and community partners to advance understanding about 
the effects of environmental exposures on human health and facilitate use of this information by affected 
communities to improve public health. The intentional disciplinary diversity of the IHSFC leaders has 
developed the Core into a highly effective resource for CHHE’s internationally renowned scientists who 
leverage diverse models for environmental health science (EHS) research, bioinformaticists who integrate data 
streams from across the health sciences, and epidemiologists and community engagement specialists who are 
substantively involved in local communities and translating CHHE research to improve public health. The 
IHSFC has been highly successful in its goal to establish key translational partnerships and resources and 
facilitate new and impactful interdisciplinary research connections and community engagement initiatives. 
Reflection on these successes revealed that a major factor in these connections was access to data science 
resources for interpreting, linking, and communicating results from basic science experiments through human 
studies and, ultimately, community engagement. Therefore, in the next funding cycle the previously separate 
data science efforts have been expanded and integrated into a new IHSFC Environmental Data Science Group 
(EDSG) that provides Center members clear access to significant data science capabilities. With expertise 
drawn from the Bioinformatics Research Center and the NC State Libraries, the EDSG component of IHSFC 
provides best-practices in data management, analysis, and sharing into all Center activities. Additionally, in the 
next funding cycle the IHSFC will revise its key personnel to accommodate the addition of the EDSG, will 
establish and extend key programmatic partnerships, and is creating new and enhancing existing resources at 
NC State and partner institutions. These activities will promote new opportunities for multidirectional translation 
between basic science, clinical research, and community organizations."

Now in its 13th year, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium is perhaps the most innovative and productive
experiment in the history of psychiatry. The PGC unified the field and attracted a cadre of outstanding
scientists (802 investigators from 157 institutions in 41 countries). PGC work has led to identification of ~500
genetic loci in the 11 psychiatric disorders we study. Our work has led to 320 papers, many in high-profile
journals (Nature 3, Cell 5, Science 2, Nat Genet 27, Nat Neurosci 9, Mol Psych 37, Biol Psych 25). As
summary statistics are freely available, psychiatric disorders often feature prominently in papers by non-PGC
investigators. To advance discovery and impact, we propose to continue the work of the PGC across 11
disorder groups. Considerable new data are coming in the next five years. We thus can rapidly and efficiently
increase our knowledge of the fundamental basis of major psychiatric disorders.
Aim 1: we will continue to advance genetic discovery for severe psychiatric disorders in all working groups,
systematically interface with large biobank studies to ensure maximal comparability, and aggressively promote
new studies of individuals with psychiatric disorders from diverse ancestries to increase discovery and improve
fine-mapping. Aim 2: most studies analyze common variation (Aim 1), rare CNV (Aim 2), and rare
exome/genome resequencing results (via collaboration) in isolation: we will apply an integrative framework to
rigorously evaluate the contributions of all measured types of genetic variation on risk for psychiatric disorders.
Aim 3: we will move beyond classical case-control definitions to a more biologically-based and nuanced
understanding by enabling large trans-diagnostic studies, convene trans-disciplinary teams to use genetics to
address unresolved questions about the nature of psychiatric disorders, and to promote large studies of the
severest cases seen in psychiatric practice (leveraging the global reach of PGC investigators). Aim 4: we will
work to maximize the impact of our work via translational efforts: close collaborations with neuroscience
consortia to understand the biological implications of our findings; work to identify modifiable causal risk
factors; and work to robustly predict clinical outcomes and identify patient subsets. Aim 5: we will increase
impact of our work by extending and formalizing outreach to different communities (including pharma and
biotech), via digital media (Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia), and by developing, distributing, and updating
resources/educational material for patients, families, and medical professionals. We will convene a Scientific
Advisory Board to ensure we respond positively to those invested in our results
Successful completion of this body of work will greatly advance knowledge of the genetic basis of psychiatric
disorders with potentially major nosological and treatment implications. These goals are consistent with a core
mission of the NIMH, and the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically,
clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights."
10933580,"Toward a deeper understanding of allostery and allotargeting by computational
approaches
Understanding allosteric mechanisms of action and their modulation by ligand binding (allo-
targeting) gained importance in recent years, as allosteric modulators allow for selective
interference with specific protein-protein interactions (PPI) or cellular pathways. Yet, despite the
growth of data and methodologies, we still lack a solid understanding of allosteric mechanisms
that underlie biological function. We propose that a completely new framework, with focus on the
change in structural dynamics rather than changes in the states only, is needed. Furthermore,
rather than limiting our attention to transitions between two end-states (e.g. open/closed forms of
a protein), one needs to consider the complete ensemble of conformers, and evaluate the effect
of intermolecular interactions or mutations vis-à-vis the changes elicited in the conformational
landscape. Toward this goal, we propose to develop, implement, and apply innovative
computational models and methods that will focus on the essential dynamics of biomolecular
systems. Essential dynamics refers to the global modes of motions intrinsically accessible to the
overall structure, i.e. they cooperatively engage most, if not all, structural elements of the biological
assembly. We propose to: (1) develop, test, and validate an essential site scanning analysis
(ESSA) methodology for predicting ‘essential’ sites that dominate the essential dynamics, and
discriminating allosteric sites among them (Aim 1), (2) enhance the capability and accuracy of our
pathogenicity predictor, RHAPSODY, for evaluating the impact of mutations (single amino acid
variants) on biological function, by including in our machine learning algorithm the features derived
from global motions of biomolecular systems, the signature dynamics of protein families, and the
experimentally resolved PPIs (Aim 2), and (3) develop a hybrid methodology for efficient
assessment of conformational landscapes applicable to proteins containing cryptic sites and cryo-
EM structures (Aim 3), and finally extend and integrate these new methodologies to enable their
efficient translation to biomedical and pharmacological applications. Method development, testing,
validation, and further extensions will entail rigorous benchmarking against other methods and/or
relevant databases where applicable, in addition to detailed case studies in collaboration with
other labs (see support letters from six experimental and one computational collaborator).
Integration of the methodologies within our well-established application programming interface
ProDy will enable efficient dissemination and wide usage of the new technologies by the broader
community."

homeostasis. Mutations of proteins within this network can lead to degenerative diseases
including muscular dystrophy. We have now identified mutations in two domains of an HSP40
co-chaperone, DNAJB6, in an autosomal dominantly inherited Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy
(LGMDD1). Our central hypothesis is that LGMDD1 mutations alter the conformation of
DNAJB6 such that the interface between these two domains is disrupted, leading to myofibril
disorganization and muscle dysfunction. Based on our results, we further hypothesize that all
LGMDD1 mutations in DNAJB6 can be rescued by perturbation of Hsp70 interaction or activity.
Thus, our approach is to employ all of the tools we have developed to test these hypotheses. In
order to tackle this challenging problem, we will explore DNAJB6 chaperone function and
dysfunction utilizing multiple systems and the expertise of two PIs. Aim 1 will explore whether
manipulating DNAJB6:HSP70 interactions rescues LGMDD1 phenotypes in mouse models and
human cells. Aim 2 will determine the effect of newly identified LGMDD1-associated DNAJB6 J-
domain mutations on chaperone activity in cellular models. Aim 3 will determine the effect of
LGMDD1 mutations on chaperone and co-chaperone function in vivo and in vitro. Our
preliminary data suggest that we have identified additional therapeutic targets that may be
better tolerated in patients than global inhibitors of Hsp70. The overarching goal of this work is
to leverage our transdisciplinary success to develop therapeutic intervention for patients with
LGMDD1."

Migration affects hundreds of millions of families worldwide. Migrants often leave family members in their origin
communities, which can challenge the wellbeing among the children. It is not well understood how migration
influences left-behind family members’ socialization of children or children’s social competence and adjustment
problems in sending communities. Migration is expected to alter how family members engage with, make
expectations for, and provide for children, and alter children’s experiences and resources. These challenges
and opportunities are expected to affect children’s social competence and adjustment problems. For instance,
family members’ migration is hypothesized to predict less monitoring by left-behind caregivers and, in turn,
higher drug and alcohol use for children. Benefits of migration are also anticipated, for instance, children’s
increased responsibilities may positively predict their behavioral control. The project will follow children who
previously participated in 2 time points of data collection and provide new data on the children, their primary
caregivers, and their fathers at 2 additional time points. In combination with the prior waves of data from the
same children and their caregivers, the project will yield high-quality information about children (5 to 17 years
old at Time 1) across 6 years in a large sample that is representative of the study area. Key developmental
transitions into school, adolescence, and adulthood are captured. The research will illustrate the complex ways
in which family members’ migration predicts children’s socio-emotional outcomes. The specific aims of the
project are: 1) to investigate reciprocal effects of caregivers’ socialization and children’s socio-emotional
development, 2) to determine how family members’ migration is associated with socio-emotional outcomes,
and how child, family, and migration characteristics moderate associations, and 3) to explore fathers’ roles in
children’s socio-emotional outcomes, and compare fathers’ familial relationships and socialization for those
who do versus do not participate in migration. This is an innovative extension of prior research; the project will
provide a longer and more detailed view of children’s development and the dynamics of migration in and out of
their households. Furthermore, including migrating and non-migrating fathers’ interviews supports an
innovative investigation of their unique contributions to children’s socio-emotional development that goes
beyond their economic contributions. Migrating fathers are expected to have poorer marital quality than non-
migrating fathers, which may indirectly affect children’s socio-emotional outcomes via parent-child
relationships. The new knowledge developed about migration’s costs and benefits will be useful for families as
they adapt to changes migration brings to relationships and caregiving, help policy makers anticipate the
challenges migration poses to children’s socio-emotional wellbeing, and inform children’s rights protections."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health crisis with no available cure. Given recent failures of
many AD clinical trials, there is an urgent need for developing effective strategies to identify new AD targets for
disease modeling and new candidates for drug repurposing and development. We propose here a research
project to develop transformative big data analytic approaches in the fields of translational bioinformatics,
machine learning and deep learning to advance drug repurposing for AD. Our overarching goal is to develop
innovative machine learning and deep learning approaches as well as informatics tools and pipelines that
leverage big data in relevant biomedical domains. These big data include large-scale genetic, multi-omics,
imaging, cognitive and other phenotypic data from landmark AD studies, functional interaction data among
drugs, proteins and diseases, pharmacologic perturbation data, electronic health record data, and MarketScan
data. Our proposed computational research is aimed at developing novel translational informatics approaches
to analyze various types of molecular, clinical and other relevant data to identify individual drugs or drug
combinations with favorable efficacy and toxicity profiles as candidates for repositioning against AD or AD-
related dementia (ADRD). To achieve our goal, we have four Aims. Aim 1 is to develop network-based multi-
omics data integration methods to identify genes and pathways as novel targets for AD drug repositioning
research. Aim 2 is to develop informatics strategies to prioritize and evaluate promising candidate targets via
examining their associations with AD biomarkers and phenotypes. Aim 3 is to develop knowledge-driven drug
repurposing methods using network reinforcement and drug scoring to identify AD candidate drugs. Aim 4 is to
prioritize and evaluate the identified candidate drugs for repurposing against AD/ADRD using pharmacologic
perturbation, EHR and MarketScan data. Successful completion of these aims will produce novel translational
big data analytic methods and tools to improve our understanding of the genetic, molecular and neurobiological

10808160,"Despite focused research efforts, the five year survival for ovarian cancer (OC) has remained
unchanged for decades and novel therapies are urgently needed for this deadly disease. Therapies that
activate the immune system to kill cancer cells, including anti-PD-1 checkpoint blockade therapy, have shown
vigorous and durable responses, but the majority of patients, including those with OC, fail to respond. The
underlying mechanism remains unclear. Repetitive elements (REs) comprise the majority (45%) of the human
genome. In most somatic tissues, REs are silenced by DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications to
prevent their transcription. We demonstrated that treating OC cells with DNA methylation inhibitors (DNMTis)
and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) increases immune signaling from tumors through demethylation of
REs and production of RE double-stranded RNA to activate the interferon response. This signaling recruits
CD8+ T cells to sensitize tumors to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. REs translate proteins that can be targeted as
tumor-associated antigens. Thus RE activation both promotes interferon signaling to reverse the immune-
suppressive tumor microenvironment and presents potential tumor-specific antigens as T cell targets.
 The premise of this proposal is that P53 and epigenetic mechanisms regulate REs in cancer and thus
mutant TP53 will affect immune signaling and response to epigenetic and immune therapy. Approximately half
of all cancers have mutations in TP53, the gene encoding the P53 protein, 90% of which are “hotspot”
mutations located in the DNA binding domain. These missense mutations encode functional proteins with
reduced transcriptional activity at canonical cell cycle target genes that may also exhibit oncogenic gain of
function transcriptional activity at new targets. High grade serous OC makes up about 70% of all cases and is
characterized by nearly 100% mutant TP53. While the critical role of P53 in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis
is known, P53 regulation of REs in cancer remains poorly defined. Approximately 30% of P53 binding sites are
found in REs and our preliminary data show that P53 binds directly to REs. Further, we show that P53 hotspot
mutant cell lines treated with DNMTi/HDACi exhibit significantly increased chromatin accessibility at REs and
transcription of REs compared to TP53 wild type cell lines. We hypothesize that mutant P53 aberrantly
activates REs, amplifying the RE-induced immune response.
 We will test this hypothesis via the following aims: In Aim 1, we will determine how wild type and mutant
TP53 regulate REs to affect the DNMTi/HDACi-induced interferon response. In Aim 2, we will determine how
p53 status affects the DNMTi/HDACi-induced T cell response and sensitization to immune therapy in a mouse
model of OC and a clinical trial of OC patients treated with immunotherapy. In Aim 3, we will evaluate REs as
tumor antigens in different P53 backgrounds. Results of this innovative work will answer novel basic science
questions about REs and P53 and open new directions for epigenetic and immune therapy in OC."

 The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that impact a range of
human behaviors including arm function, speech, and vision. Tools that can quantify motor deficits in a
granular and objective manner are needed to support early recognition of clinical disease onset, more
sensitively determine efficacy of a therapy, and make personalized predictions about disease progression.
Such tools are needed for upcoming disease modifying clinical trials in SCAs, in order to reduce sample size
and trial duration and better understand how a given therapy modifies human behaviors. Powered off of the
currently available primary outcome measures for these rare ataxias, clinical trials are likely to face patient
recruitment and retention challenges, especially with multiple co-occurring clinical trials. These challenges may
impede or slow our ability to successfully discover therapies for our patients.
 We have recently made substantial progress in capturing multimodal behavioral signals from speech,
eye movement, and arm motor function using everyday technologies: a microphone, iPhone camera, and
computer mouse. Our initial data indicate that these scalable technologies have strong potential to extend
current clinical assessments in ataxia and that our novel machine learning approach for generating disease
severity estimates performs better than the traditional regression model approach. Our algorithms are able to
quantitatively identify signs of ataxia and parkinsonism in SCA individuals' speech and arm movement, even
when absent on clinical assessment. Furthermore, our novel severity estimation algorithm enabled
measurement of disease progression more sensitively than clinical scales. We propose to substantially expand
longitudinal data collection and further develop our novel analytic approaches to train more powerful models for
characterizing and quantifying human motor behavior. The technologies developed have the potential to
facilitate clinical trials aimed at bringing disease modifying therapies to individuals with SCA. While the focus of
this project is on SCA, the novel methodological approaches and data generated are applicable to other
neurodegenerative diseases affecting movement and speech. Furthermore, this project will bring new insight
into how motor abnormalities initially arise and progress.
 The overall goal of this project is to develop widely available systems for improving early detection of
clinical disease onset, severity assessment, and prognostication of spinocerebellar ataxias while
simultaneously learning how these disorders impact fine-grained motor behavior."

The Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP)—the only randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing foster
care to institutional care for young children—was designed to address essential questions about human
development and when and how to intervene with children exposed to early severe psychosocial deprivation.
The BEIP has identified the effects of being raised in large institutions in life on psychopathology and brain
structure and function, yet, to date, understanding of the broader health consequences remain unknown. We
propose a new assessment of BEIP participants at age 22 years to provide data regarding cardiometabolic risk
factors and health behaviors to answer timely questions about the long-term impact of severe early neglect,
and the subsequent social experiences and biological risk factors capable of attenuating or amplifying later
health risk as these individuals enter adulthood, a key time period for cardiovascular risk. This proposal
leverages existing repeated assessments from when the participants were infants and toddlers still living in
institutions, after randomization to care as usual or foster care placement, and through age 16. We propose to
conduct physical health assessments of BEIP participants at age 22, via clinical examinations, laboratory tests,
and self-reported health behaviors. We will assess six outcome domains: 1) body size, fat, and fat distribution;
2) blood pressure; 3) serum-based metabolic risk markers; 4) inflammatory biomarkers, 5) telomere length,
and 6) self-reported health behaviors, including sleep, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco use, and diet. In
Aim 1, we will examine the long-term effects of early institutionalization and the foster care intervention on
cardiometabolic risk in young adulthood. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the moderating effects of stress reactivity in
adolescence and telomere attrition from mid-childhood to adulthood on the associations between early
institutionalization and foster care on cardiometabolic risks in young adulthood. In Aim 3, we will determine the
moderating effects of institutional rearing and foster care on the associations between stressful life events and
cardiometabolic risk. Our overarching hypothesis is that severe neglect in early life will negatively impact
cardiometabolic wellbeing in young adulthood and that subsequent social experiences and biological risk
factors can moderate this trajectory. Our proposal is innovative as the RCT design provides an unparalleled
opportunity to test how early psychosocial deprivation and later caregiving shape cardiometabolic risk in early
adulthood. Our results will provide the most comprehensive examination to date of the long-term impact of
early deprivation and foster care on cardiometabolic risks and related health behaviors. This proposal is
significant as it is expected to inform policies pertaining to millions of children exposed to institutional care
worldwide and clinical practices for children exposed to the most prevalent form of child maltreatment, neglect."
10799631,"ABSTRACT
The major obstacle to successful cancer therapy is the rapid development of drug resistance. While targeted
therapies often extend overall survival in the subset of patients with sensitizing mutations, their effects are
short-lived. Patients who initially respond to these drugs generally develop resistance within a few months.
Single-cell sequencing of tumors has revealed significant genetic heterogeneity; tumor cells without the
sensitizing mutation survive therapy and re-populate the tumor. At the same time, compensatory epigenetic
and genetic changes relieve dependence on the targeted pathway, also contributing to resistance. There is
thus a critical unmet need for new therapeutic strategies capable of providing more robust cancer control. A
robust system continues to function even when an individual component fails. In the context of drug
development, a robust therapy would produce parallel, redundant anti-cancer effects, each of which is
sufficient to inhibit tumor growth. One approach to achieving such redundancy is to embrace the pleiotropic
actions of natural compounds. Endogenous signaling molecules produce coordinated and complex responses
by targeting multiple signaling nodes in parallel. For example, endogenous sphingolipids exhibit potent tumor
suppressor activity by producing multifaceted and incompletely characterized changes in signaling pathways
that trigger proliferative arrest in normal cells and death in cancer cells. SH-BC-893 (893), a synthetic
sphingolipid with improved drug properties, retains the anti-neoplastic activity of these natural compounds. In a
rigorous, genetically-engineered mouse model for aggressive prostate cancer, 893 reduces autochthonous
tumor growth by 82%. In a related subcutaneous isograft model, 893 produces tumor regressions in >50% of
mice. 893 is also effective against patient-derived prostate tumor organoids that are resistant to standard-of-
care therapies. The major argument against pleiotropic agents has been that toxicity will be unacceptably
amplified relative to more specific drugs. However, natural sphingolipids induce quiescence in normal cells as
part of an adaptive, homeostatic response to stress. Indeed, 893 does not cause organ toxicity or disrupt the
proliferation of normal cells in the bone marrow or intestinal crypts even after 3 months of treatment with the
anti-neoplastic dose. Normal cells are more resistant to 893, but 893’s pharmacokinetic properties also likely
contribute to its safety margin. Our preliminary data showing that 893 engages multiple, high-value oncology
targets results raise the possibility that 893 will be less susceptible to drug resistance and could overcome
resistance to FDA-approved therapies. This proposal will test this provocative hypothesis. The expected results
would have a significant positive impact by changing thinking in the field and providing a novel therapeutic
strategy that would be effective in patients with late-stage, lethal prostate cancers."
10813137,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell growth triggers human cell division at the G1/S transition before DNA is replicated. This process is important
because it determines the size of proliferating cells, which is important for their physiological functions. Larger
cells, including macrophages and hepatocytes, often have additional copies of their genome in proportion to their
increased cell size. Typically, such large cells maintain their DNA-to-cytoplasm ratio by triggering DNA synthesis,
but not division, at cell sizes in proportion to their ploidy. However, while cell size and ploidy are frequently
correlated, the function of maintaining the DNA-to-cytoplasm ratio is unclear. Moreover, we do not know the
molecular mechanisms controlling the DNA-to-cytoplasm ratio despite having identified many key cell cycle
regulatory proteins. Here, we propose to determine both the function of the DNA-to-cytoplasm ratio and the
regulatory mechanisms linking cell growth to DNA replication in vivo by examining mouse hepatocytes in
developmental and regenerative contexts. The scientific premise of this work is a recent breakthrough that my
laboratory made in understanding how cell growth triggers division. Contrary to expectations that growth would
increase Cyclin D-Cdk4,6 activity, we found instead that cell growth dilutes the cell cycle inhibitor Rb to trigger
division in cultured cells. Our discovery of the Rb dilution mechanism in vitro raises the question if this mechanism
operates in vivo. Here, we propose to definitively test the Rb dilution, and an alternative model in which small
cells activate p38 to inhibit cell division in mouse hepatocytes. We will measure changes in hepatocyte cell size
and how cell growth is coupled to cell cycle progression in a series of mouse lines in which Rb1 has been
conditionally deleted, knocked down or over-expressed. Preliminary data indicate that for hepatocytes of the
same ploidy, the DNA-to-cytoplasm ratio is inversely correlated with Rb1 gene dosage, consistent with the Rb-
dilution model. We will use these genetic models that change the DNA-to-cytoplasm ratio to test its function in
the liver. More specifically, we will use inducible knockdown and over-expression alleles to generate hepatocytes
that are larger and smaller than wild type and have aberrant DNA-to-cytoplasm ratios. We will then perform a
panel of liver function and regeneration tests. This is important because aberrant DNA-to-cytoplasm ratio is
associated with various pathological states, but its function in vivo is still unclear in any cell type. Taken together,
the proposed work is important because determining how cell growth triggers cell division is a fundamental
question in cell and developmental biology. Its understanding will also provide insight into cancers, where this
process is misregulated."

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a curative therapy most commonly applied in
treatment of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). The progeny of alloreactive ab T cells in the
allograft can kill recipient leukemia cells, thereby mediating the graft-vs-leukemia effect (GVL). Nevertheless,
disease relapse, indicative of insufficient GVL, is the single most common cause of death post-transplant.
GVL-resistance and sensitivity are not equal across classes of leukemias, despite all expressing alloantigens.
For example, chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (CP-CML) is exquisitely GVL-sensitive whereas
blast crisis CML (BC-CML) is GVL-resistant, despite sharing common biology. Likewise, AML and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia are relatively GVL-resistant. Because GVL-resistance and -sensitivity track with the
class of neoplasm, we reasoned that they are leukemia cell-intrinsic properties. We therefore established GVL
against mouse models of mCP-CML and mBC-CML created with authentic human oncogenes. Through the
creation of gene-deficient leukemias we discovered that for effective GVL, mBC-CML requires IFN-γR
stimulation whereas GVL is fully intact against STAT1/STAT2-/- mCP-CML that cannot respond to any type of
IFN. IFN-γR-/- MLL-AF9 was also GVL-resistant. These data indicate that effective GVL against myeloblastic
leukemias requires a high magnitude alloreactive T cell response that generates IFN-g whereas a more
smoldering T cell response that does not create much IFN-g can be effective against CP-CML. These results
also strongly suggest that the delivery of IFN-g, in conjunction with alloreactive or leukemia-reactive T cells,
would have a major clinical impact. However, key questions need to be answered to optimally apply IFN-g or
agents that induce some of its effects in the clinic. First, while all AML subtypes share some common biology,
there is substantial heterogeneity in driver genes. It will therefore be critical to understand which AML
molecular subtypes require IFN-g for optimal GVL. We aim to do so by using CRISPR-Cas9 to delete the IFN-
γR from transplantable leukemias that develop in compound gene-edited mice that express key AML-driver
genes, sometimes in conjunction with a gene deletion. We have already successfully edited the IFN-γR from
JAK2V617F/p53-/- and FLT3-ITD/DNMT3-/-/NPM1c AMLs. Second, IFN-g is a blunt tool with pleiotropic effects
that could promote graft-vs-host disease. Therefore, we aim to understand under what alloimmune conditions
IFN-g is required and what specific downstream effects are essential to sensitize AML cells to GVL. We have
already developed approaches to restore expression of key IFN-g-induced genes (e.g. CIITA, NLRC5, ICAM-1)
to IFN-γR-/- leukemias in order to specifically interrogate their relevance. Further targets will be discovered
through single cell RNAseq, focusing on IFN-g-induced gene expression changes in subpopulations with stem
cell qualities. These targets could then be deleted or expressed in IFN-γR leukemias to further define their
importance."

evidence-based treatments. This K23 study will examine how multidisciplinary team functioning in CACs is
associated with implementation of a screening and referral protocol and whether improving team functioning
can enhance implementation efforts. Understanding how multidisciplinary teams facilitate or hinder

10810657,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Sepsis is a critical problem around the world causing 20% of all global deaths. The lack of highly
effective therapeutics leaves critically ill patients with systemic organ dysfunction often caused
damage the vascular endothelium. Our lab has shown that one of the drivers of vascular
dysfunction in sepsis is circulating oxidized cell-free hemoglobin (CFH). During septic conditions,
red blood cells become increasingly fragile leading to lysis and release of CFH into the vascular
circulation allowing for oxidation from ferrous (2+) and oxidized ferric (3+, methemoglobin)
forms. Data from our lab demonstrates that only the oxidized 3+ form of CFH induces
microvascular barrier dysfunction. However, the intracellular mechanisms underpinning this
dysfunction are not well understood. My preliminary studies suggest that oxidized CFH causes
mitochondrial dysfunction such as increased superoxide production and loss of total
mitochondria. In parallel to circulating CFH being increased in septic patients, there is increased
circulating extracellular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) during sepsis. Importantly, the mechanism
underlying release of mtDNA during sepsis remains a key knowledge gap. In addition, it is
unknown whether the mtDNA is released as freely soluble molecules or if it is inside
extracellular vesicles (EVs). Understanding if mtDNA is contained inside EVs could inform
potential effects, distribution, and stability of the circulating mtDNA. In this project, I will test
the hypothesis that CFH-induced oxidative damage causes mtDNA release from the vascular
endothelium leading to downstream loss of macrovascular barrier integrity. The first aim of this
project focuses on identifying the mechanisms behind CFH-induced oxidative damage and its
role in mtDNA release from the pulmonary microvascular endothelium. We will evaluate the
impact of CFH on mitochondrial oxidative damage and permeability pore activation. In addition,
we will quantify whether the mtDNA is freely soluble or contained inside EVs, and if
antioxidants block this secretion. The second aim of the project will determine the effect of
mtDNA on endothelial barrier function. We will also use platelet poor plasma from a highly
characterized prospective cohort of sepsis patients to quantify circulating mtDNA and correlate
levels with mortality, ARDS development, and markers of endothelial damage. At the
conclusion of this study, we will have uncovered a novel molecular mechanism of CFH induced
vascular dysfunction, and characterized both the effects of mtDNA and how it is released from
endothelial cells. This proposed project will provide multidisciplinary experience and growth to
establish the foundation for a successful career as a mechanistic and translational scientist."

 Epigenetic dysregulation is a shared mechanism of many developmental disorders. One such disorder,
Tatton-Brown-Rahman Syndrome (TBRS), results from heterozygous mutations in the de novo DNA
methyltransferase, DNMT3A. TBRS is characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, overgrowth, multiple
developmental abnormalities, and a predisposition to various malignancies. Since its 2014 discovery, more than
200 patients with TBRS have been identified. In the blood, patients with TBRS exhibit decreased methylation at
developmental gene clusters, and abnormal tissue development in patients with TBRS results in numerous
lifelong complications. However, a major gap in knowledge is that the mechanism by which DNMT3A regulates
development of non-hematopoietic tissues remains unknown. Our lab has identified two individuals who exhibit
a mixture of wild-type and DNMT3A-mutant cells throughout their bodies, such that they are constitutive mosaics.
The distribution of mutant cells is highly variable across their tissues, and concomitant analysis of wild-type and
mutant cells reveals methylation differences that suggest a role of DNMT3A in tissue development. We
hypothesize that DNMT3A wild-type and mutant cells have distinct propensities to form different tissues
when directly competed with one another. Understanding which tissues are favored by mutant cells in somatic
mosaics will lend insight into the pathogenesis of TBRS.
 To test our central hypothesis, I have established a novel mouse model of somatic mosaicism. I will use
this mouse and an in vitro cell culture system to address two aims: 1) I will investigate the effect of Dnmt3a loss
on the differentiation capacity of specific stem cell populations, and 2) I will investigate the downstream
contribution of Dnmt3a-mutant versus wild-type cells to post-natal mouse tissues. Our long-term goal is to identify
tissues in which DNMT3A loss confers a selective advantage or disadvantage and to explore the mechanism of
this differential tissue composition. The project is designed to prepare me for a career as an academic pediatric
oncologist specializing in inherited developmental and cancer predisposition syndromes. The Goodell lab has
made seminal discoveries in DNMT3A biology and has a long track-record of successful MSTP trainees. The
collaborative training environment at Baylor College of Medicine, with its state-of-the-art technology cores and
prime location in the Texas Medical Center will facilitate the success of this project. In the future, the results of
these studies may inform the clinical care of patients with TBRS by identifying tissues in which a DNMT3A
mutation is poorly tolerated. The studies may also help to inform genetic counselling of parents of patients with
TBRS about their risk of recurrence by characterizing expansion or depletion of DNMT3A-mutant cells in gonadal
tissues. Finally, these results will expand our understanding of how mutant cells that appear in early
embryogenesis compete with wild-type cells to shape normal and disordered development."

Recent developments in single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) such as direct library preparation
(DLP) have enabled rich interrogation into the genomic diversity of hard-to-treat breast and ovarian cancers.
Studies from the Shah Lab have used DLP to infer clonal fitness from time-series sampling and assess the
impact of mutational processes on structural genomic plasticity; however, these studies only looked at
genomes from non-replicating cells. The proposed project leverages S-phase cells captured by DLP to
prospectively predict clonal fitness and chemosensitivity using data from a single time point (Aim 1) and,
separately, to measure the contribution of aberrant replication towards the accumulation of copy number
aberrations (CNAs) across cancers of various genetic context (Aim 2). For my first aim, I propose a
computational framework for assigning S-phase cells to phylogenetically inferred clones and subsequently
calculating the S-phase fraction (SPF) within each clone. For my second aim, I propose a Bayesian model to
estimate single-cell replication timing in a manner that is robust to somatic CNAs. I hypothesize that SPF will
be a proxy for proliferation rate and thus high SPF clones will have higher treatment-naïve fitness and
sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy than their low SPF counterparts. I further hypothesize that
heterogeneous replication timing will correlate with the extent of replication stress in a particular DLP sample.
Investigating both hypotheses will be important for extending the clinical utility of DLP since identifying which
clones will respond to chemotherapy will help guide clinical management and identifying the presence of
replication stress will help stratify patients for next-generation targeted therapies, such as ATR inhibitors, that
selectively kill cancer cells undergoing replication stress. In summary, the proposed computational methods
will extend the utility of scWGS technologies which capture replicating cells by connecting replication dynamics
to clonal fitness, replication stress, CNA patterns, and drug sensitivities in genomically unstable cancers."
10844375,"Motivational drive is an adaptive process that helps individuals overcome obstacles to obtain essential needs and hence ensure survival. Motivation is composed of two major components. The first component is the directionality of motivation (the orientation of goal-oriented behavior), such as seek food/shelter or avoid pain. The second is the activational motivation (the energizing of goal-oriented behaviors) such as increase vigor, and persistence of these actions. Impairments in these components of motivation are common characteristic among individuals who suffer from psychiatric disorders. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling different components of motivational drive have yet to be conclusively identified.  It is known that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediates different components of motivation through different subregions, the NAc shell (NAcshell) and the NAc core (NAccore). Indeed, the NAcshell facilitates the directionality of motivation through suppression of goal-irrelevant behaviors; whereas the NAccore is known to mediate the activational, or invigorating aspects, of motivational drive. However, NAc neurons rely on glutamatergic extra-striatal inputs to initiate and maintain goal-oriented behavior and motivation. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) integrates visceroceptive signals (originating from the brainstem and hypothalamus) to promote adaptive responses via projections to the NAc. Previous research and my preliminary data show that the PVT has two major distinct subpopulations of neurons, Type1PVT and Type2PVT, which differ on their genetic identity, connectional features, and functionality. Particularly, Type1PVT neurons send strong inputs to the NAccore and are activated during the activational components of motivational drive. Whereas, Type2PVT neurons project almost exclusively to the NAcshell and are active during omissions of expected rewards. However, despite this evidence, the contribution of PVT inputs to the NAc in mediation of goal-oriented behavior and motivation remain largely unknown.  My central hypothesis is that Type1PVT–NAccore and Type2PVT–NAcshell neurons are part of independent but complementary thalamo-striatal pathways and they each play a distinct role in motivation. Specifically, Type1PVT-NAccore neurons are critical for the activational component of motivational drive, while Type2PVT–NAcshell neurons facilitate the directionality of motivation by suppression of goal-irrelevant behaviors. Using a multidisciplinary approach that includes a combination of anatomical, imaging, optogenetic, and behavioral techniques, I will characterize PVT-NAc connectivity with anatomical and functional precision. Thereafter, I will then establish the role of Type1PVT–NAccore neurons and Type2PVT–NAcshell neurons in mediating the activational and directionality components of motivated behavior. These findings will advance our understanding of the contributions of thalamo-striatal circuits promoting motivational drive that can create fundamental insights to develop novel approaches for individuals suffering from motivational deficits."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of late-onset dementia. The extents of tau pathology are
closely related to memory decline. How pathogenic tau causes cognitive deficits is not clear. While most
studies on tau have been focused on direct effects of tau on neurons, compelling human genetic studies linked
maladaptive innate immune responses, including microglial responses, to elevated risk of developing late-
onset Alzheimer disease. The striking enrichment of innate immune genes as risk alleles for Alzheimer
disease supports critical disease-enhancing role of maladaptive microglia in tau-mediated cognitive deficits.
Identifying how maladaptive microglial enhances tau toxicity could lead to new therapeutic strategies. In our
preliminary studies, we found that tauopathy mice exhibit hyperactive Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-
Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling. As a major sensor of cytosolic DNA, cGAS-STING pathway
mobilizes antiviral responses via activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and expression of cytokine
and type I interferon genes. The hyperactive cGAS pathways contributes to tau toxicity since genetic reduction
of cGAS protected against tau-mediated spatial learning and memory deficits in a tauopathy mouse model of
Alzheimer disease. In addition, the protective effects were associated with reduced interferon-enriched
microglial subpopulations and reprogramming of disease-associated microglial states as identified using single
nuclei RNA-seq. We hypothesize that microglial cGAS-STING hyperactivation mediates the maladaptive
disease-enhancing microglial response in tauopathy. To test this hypothesis, In Aim 1, we will first determine
how cGAS activation in microglia enhances tau toxicity (1a). Using a combination of single nuclei RNA-seq,
pathological and functional analyses, we will investigate if toxicity from cGAS hyperactivation in microglia or
bone marrow-derived monocytes (1b, 1c). In Aim 2, we will dissect if the toxic effects of cGAS activation in
tauopathy are mediated by STING-dependent or -independent mechanisms, we will determine if loss of STING
phenocopies the effects of cGAS inactivation on tau toxicity and transcriptomic changes (2a). We will then
determine STING-independent mechanisms of cGAS activation by assessing how cGAS inactivation affects
tau toxicity on Sting null background (2b). The significant protective effects of partial loss of cGAS supports that
partial inhibition with pharmacological inhibitors of cGAS could be beneficial for tauopathy. We showed that a
specific cGAS inhibitor, TDI6570, is brain permeable and effectively inhibit expression of type 1 interferon
target genes in tauopathy mice. We will then optimize the dosing using formulated chow based on PK/PD, and
evaluate the beneficial effects of the cGAS inhibitor before or after the onset of cognitive deficit in tauopathy
mice in Aim 3. Completion of the proposed study will identify novel disease-enhancing properties of innate
immune responses in AD, and provide new therapeutic direction for pharmacological intervention."

under-representation in genome-wide association studies – accounting for 23% of the global population but
only 1.2% of individuals studied – and polygenic prediction efforts to date, as well as a key public health need
for enhanced risk stratification. Individual level data in ANVIL will be paired with summary association statistics
of >100,000 South Asians and individual >1 million individuals of other ancestries, which will enable enhanced
fine-mapping, sore weighting, and transethnic benchmarking activities.
 Our Study Site aims to (1) Aggregate and harmonize genotyping and phenotype data and deliver a
sharable and scalable end-to-end analytic pipeline that starts with genotyping array data and a phenotype file
and enables automated output of polygenic score benchmarking parameters.; (2) Develop and share the new
‘FFAIRR-PRS’ statistical genetics framework, leveraging: (i) fine-mapping to assign causal probabilities based
on >180 functional genomic annotations; (ii) incorporating correlations between effect sizes across traits; and
(iii) integration of South Asian and non-South Asian GWAS data; and (3) Benchmark FFAIRR-PRS scores for
27 important phenotypes in the South Asian datasets, and develop risk models that integrate genetic and
nongenetic factors. Performance will be benchmarked in accordance with ClinGen Complex Disease Working
Group recommendations and compared against individuals of European and other major ancestry groups.
Beyond enhanced polygenic scores – aware of an ultimate aim of clinical implementation – we will develop a

matched control subjects without pathological changes in the frontal lobe. In this proposal, we aim to develop
a large-scale proteomics platform to map the temporal occurrence of PTMs as disease progresses. We will
examine a valuable new set of cases, selected to encompass all Braak stages from 0 to VI. All cases in this
new cohort will have detailed premortem clinical data, which will allow us to detect and assess correlations
between clinical and pathophysiological findings and any tau PTM that is identified in this study. For this
analysis, we will study 3 brain regions (entorhinal/amygdala, and temporal and visual cortex) in 20 Braak 0
subjects; 40 early stage Braak I/II subjects; 40 mid stage Braak III/IV subjects; and 40 end stage Braak V/VI
subjects. We will also map the global proteomes of the brain specimens from this well-characterized patient
cohort to identify the enzymes associated with these Braak stage dependent PTMs. The findings of the tau
characterization and mapping of the proteomes will be validated using widely accepted Tau sensor assays
used to study Tau aggregation in AD.
In summary, this Tau PTM specific dataset, the deep proteome maps and the subsequent validation
experiments in seeding assays will be used to test our overarching hypothesis: Understanding how the
progressive accumulation of Tau PTMs results in the toxicity and seeding competence of tau, and mapping the
disease progression dependence of these PTMs and the enzymes responsible for them will allow us to develop
interventional strategies at earlier and prodromal stages of disease."

 MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemias account for 5-10% of human acute leukemia and is associated with
poor prognosis. The unmet clinical needs and the lack of an effective targeted therapy to the MLL-r
leukemias emphasize the need for novel regimens. Recent cancer epigenetics studies discovered a central
role for the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L in MLL-r leukemogenesis. Important
clinical responses have been noted with DOT1L inhibitor treatment as a single agent, however, it is expected
that combination treatments will be necessary.
 Our preliminary studies based on a Tudor domain focused CRISPR screen in MLL-r leukemia identified
SGF29 as a novel vulnerability in MLL-r leukemia. The objective of this application is to determine the critical
epigenetic mechanisms that mediate the availability of KAT2A/B to maintain H3K9ac and oncogene expression
in MLL-r leukemia. Our central hypothesis is that SGF29, an H3K4me3 reader protein, mediates recruitment
of KAT2A/B to maintain histone H3K9ac and MYC oncogenic program in MLL-r leukemia. We will dissect the
SGF29-mediated epigenetic mechanisms (Aim 1) and investigate the efficacy of SGF29 targeting (alone or in
combination with DOT1L inhibition) as a novel therapy in MLL-r leukemia (Aim 2).
 This study is innovative because (1) it introduces a novel concept of simultaneously targeting multiple
components of an epigenetic network to efficiently suppress the cancer programs, and (2) it establishes a
brand new genetic screen approach for a sub-protein level functional pocket and drug discovery. The impact
of this research will be of significance because (1) it immediately provides novel therapeutic opportunities
against the difficult-to-treat MLL-r leukemias, and (2) it will help identify novel functional elements in
epigenetic regulators for future pharmaceutical targeting."

Pancreatic beta cell insulin production is the critical lynchpin that determines diabetes resistance or susceptibility.
ER stress is one cause of beta cell dysfunction and failure, not only in T2D but also in T1D and some forms of
monogenic diabetes. Many published reports show that the ATF6 pathway, one of three principal ER stress
response pathways, plays important roles in cellular adaptation to stress. In particular, ATF6 is known to drive
beneficial effects including increased ER capacity, cell survival in the face of stress, and more recently evidence
from our group and several others implicate ATF6 in beta cell compensatory proliferation in response to insulin
demand. For these reasons, activation of ATF6 has been proposed as a potential beta cell therapeutic approach
that might improve beta cell mass and insulin production capacity. We have developed two novel, exciting tools
that allow us to activate ATF6 in beta cells with temporal precision, either ex vivo or in vivo in live mice. Initial
experiments, however, show that when we indiscriminately activate ATF6 for an extended period of time we
observe a mix of beneficial and harmful effects, in some ways reminiscent of glucotoxic beta cell failure.
Specifically, we do observe evidence of increased beta cell proliferation and survival, but activating ATF6 in vivo
continuously for a 14-day period leads to frank glucose intolerance due to beta cell dysfunction. Remarkably, if
we allow ATF6 to turn off, beta cell function gradually returns to normal. Molecular and morphological preliminary
data suggest that in vivo chronic continuous ATF6 activation mimics, in many ways, chronic beta cell stress in
T2D, with similarities to mouse and human observations. As such, this model represents a tremendous
opportunity to study the proximate causes of beta cell failure after chronic activation of one ER stress response
pathway (ATF6), as well as a unique and exciting chance to understand the in vivo recovery process if that stress
pathway activation is able to shut off. In this project we will explore the causes of beta cell failure after ATF6
activation, with in-depth molecular, morphological and tissue homeostasis experiments. We will determine the
cellular and molecular bases for beta cell recovery when ATF6 is allowed to turn off. Finally, we turn our attention
to the molecular mechanisms driving benefits and harms of ATF6 activation and seek to identify conditions in
which beneficial responses can be separated from harmful responses, to see whether it may be possible in the
future to harness ATF6 for safe therapeutic potential in diabetes treatment or prevention. If successful, this
project will lead to important new insight into beta cell stress-induced diabetes, the in vivo recovery process after
ATF6-induced beta cell dysfunction, the molecular mechanisms by which ATF6 drives benefits and harms, and
whether it may be possible to separate benefit from harm for future therapeutic benefit."
10850900,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overarching goal of the research presented in this application is to dissect the genetic, epigenetic, and
metabolic programs that encode and transmit a memory of environmental exposure for several generations. In
that context, we aim to understand how environmental influences alter the reproductive program of organisms
in a transgenerational fashion and what makes the germline a particularly important and sensitive target of
exposures.
 In mammals, in utero ethanol exposure is associated with an array of well-characterized morphological,
neurobehavioral, and reproductive issues. However, there is mounting evidence in a variety of model
organisms that some adverse reproductive and neurological features are also detectable in the third generation
following exposure indicating a transgenerational effect. Alcohol also has a clear epigenetic impact and directly
contributes to the modification of the epigenome. Nevertheless, despite the fact that heritable effects of alcohol
imply an alteration of the information contained in germ cells, it is unclear how the memory of ethanol exposure
is initiated in the germline and then transmitted to future generations. Here, we combine the tractability and
conservation of the model system C. elegans with state-of-the-art epigenomic analyses, classical genetic, and
cytological approaches to shed light on the mechanisms of memory of ethanol exposure. Our preliminary data
shows that ethanol exposure causes strong transgenerational reproductive and behavioral impairments. We
also show that, in line with recent mammalian studies, ethanol causes an increase in histone acetylation.
Thus, we hypothesize that ethanol exposure causes transgenerational perturbations of germline
function by altering the germline epigenome, specifically histone acetylation. Our aims are designed to
address the molecular, metabolic and epigenetic requirements for these transgenerational impacts of ethanol.
In aim 1, we will build on our preliminary reproduction data to interrogate through classical genetics tools
meiotic pathways at the root of ethanol's trans-generational increase in germline apoptosis and embryonic
lethality. In aim 2, we will examine via mass spectrometry the modulation in 80 different histone marks
stemming from direct ethanol exposure and test whether increased histone acetylation is a required event for
the initiation ethanol's transgenerational reproductive effects. Finally, in aim 3, we will test the epigenetic
requirement for the transgenerational transmission of ethanol's effects and also map by CUT&RUN the
changes in the epigenetic landscape of histone modifications in the germline.
 At the completion of the aims, we will have identified the molecular underpinnings for the initiation and
transmission of ethanol transgenerational reproductive outcomes."
10771227,"New biologically-based therapeutics that target signaling pathways have tremendous potential to provide
novel treatments for chronic and often debilitating diseases. One such approach is the creation of ligand traps,
which capture proteins that exhibit high-affinity binding to a receptor extracellular domain, and subsequently
prevent these molecules from activating target cells. Preclinical studies employing ligand traps for Acvr2A/B
(2A/B-LT), type 2 receptors in the TGF-β superfamily, collectively demonstrate that reducing canonical Smad2/3
signaling reduces the disease burden in mouse models of chronic illnesses. Based on these findings, ongoing
and planned clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of 2A/B-LT in patients with obesity, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, cancer-induced cachexia, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and anemia of inflammation.
Most of these chronic illnesses also have skeletal manifestations, and beneficial changes in bone mass and
strength have been reported in mice treated with 2A/B-LT. However, why 2A/B-LT treatment has positive effects
on the skeleton, what cell populations are directly affected by 2A/B-LT, and the mechanism(s) by which
decreasing Smad2/3 activation regulates bone cell responses are largely unknown. Filling these gaps in
knowledge will be critical to identifying any skeletal side effects of using 2A/B-LT. Findings from our lab suggest
that genetic deletion of Alk4, a type 1 receptor within the TGF-β superfamily, in early osteoprogenitors results in
increased bone mass in mice. Furthermore, data from our group and others suggests bone homeostasis may
be influenced by opposing changes in Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8 signaling due to shared usage of Acvr2A/B
between BMPs and Alk4-activating ligands. We therefore hypothesize that circulating ligands signaling
through Alk4 regulate bone homeostasis and pathogenesis by competition between Smad2/3 and
Smad1/5/8 signaling. Completion of the aims in our proposal will allow us to identify the bone cell targets of
these TGF-β superfamily ligand traps (SA1), determine whether the ligand trap Alk4-FC has therapeutic potential
in bone (SA2), examine the efficacy of Alk4-FC in 2 chronic disease models (SA3), and inform about the
molecular events that comprise the skeletal response to ligands that activate Smad2/3 signaling (SA4). The
questions addressed in this proposal are significant because they fill a critical knowledge gap about potential off-
target effects on the skeleton that may occur when 2A/B-LT is used to treat chronic diseases. We believe the
results we obtain by completing our studies are impactful because they highlight the potential of using 2A/B-LT
and/or Alk4-FC to prevent/modulate the generalized bone loss that occurs with age, as well as to enhance bone
fracture repair. Further, our studies will significantly advance our understanding of the role of Smad2/3 and
Smad1/5/8 signaling in the adult skeleton, and provide a framework for understanding TGF-β superfamily biology
as a mechanism for ensuring homeostasis in bone and other target tissues."

Chromatin remodeling and gene expression are highly dynamic processes in the nucleus. The regulation of
these processes is crucial to maintain proper cellular functions. Chromatin remodeling enzymes mediate
changes in chromatin structure and control the cycling of chromatin-associated factors on and off the genome.
The remodeling of chromatin depends on metabolites (e.g., ATP and NAD+), which fuels chromatin remodeling
enzymes activity. NMNAT1 is a metabolic enzyme primarily involved in the local production of NAD+ in the
nucleus. NMNAT1 is thought to provide pools of NAD+ which fuels NAD+-dependent chromatin remodeling
enzymes, including SIRT1 and PARP1. However, various studies suggest that NMNAT1 may also allosterically
regulate these enzymes activity in an enzymatic independent manner. Nonetheless, the role of NMNAT1 in
regulating chromatin remodeling and gene expression through local NAD+ production and interactions with
chromatin remodeling enzymes remains poorly defined. In this proposal, I seek to define the role of NMNAT1 in
regulating chromatin remodeling enzymes activity, chromatin structure, and gene expression. I hypothesize that
the cycling of NMNAT1 on the genome produces local NAD+ gradients that regulate chromatin-modifying
enzyme activity, influencing rapid changes in chromatin structure and gene expression of target genes. To
address this hypothesis, I will (1) establish an NMNAT1 knock-out cellular system to perform structure-function
studies in live cells and identify phenotypical defects upon depletion of NMNAT1. To validate this system, I will
perform rescue experiments with wild-type NMNAT1 and catalytic dead mutant NMNAT1. (2) Examine how
NMNAT1 regulates the expression of chromatin remodeling enzymes (e.g., SIRT1) target genes by defining
changes in chromatin structure, gene expression and genomic occupancy, and (3) establish how NMNAT1
cycling dynamics regulate chromatin remodelers and transcriptional bursting. These studies will be essential to
determine how nuclear metabolic enzymes like NMNAT1 and metabolite production regulate chromatin structure
and gene expression of target genes. This knowledge will define new paradigms regarding gene expression and
regulation. Under the mentorship of Drs. Robert Coleman and Robert H. Singer, Yessenia Cedeno Cedeno will
receive multi-disciplinary training in molecular and cellular biology combined with expertise in state-of-the-art
microscopy. This will allow Yessenia to successfully execute the proposed research and training plans and
advance her professional career as an independent scientist."
10778217,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Optimal fetal growth and development requires robust placental function, which is affected by blood glucose and
lipid concentrations but also potentially chemical/drug exposures. Drugs may alter epigenetic homeostasis by
direct or indirect mechanisms (transcription activity) that can persist long after exposure to the drug (i.e.
pharmacoepigenomics). Our preliminary data has shown differentially methylated regions in DNA from
trophoblasts in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes (GDM) compared to non-GDM trophoblasts.
Moreover, metformin and GDM independently and significantly decreases mitochondrial respiration and
placental hormone gene and protein expression in placental trophoblasts. Placental hormones, particularly β-
hCG are necessary for normal fetal growth and development. Recent trials using metformin in pregnancy has
demonstrated potential maternal benefits such as lower gestational weight gain but higher rates of small-for-
gestational age infants and greater weight z-scores and adiposity in children. This highlights the critical gap in
our knowledge of the effects of metformin on placental health and its role on potential beneficial and adverse
perinatal outcomes. Our objectives are to (Aim 1) determine the effects of metformin on trophoblast epigenomic
and transcriptomic profiles and (Aim 2) determine the degree to which metformin treatment suppresses
cytotrophoblast maturation and hCG production in GDM and non-GDM placentas. Epigenomic and
transcriptomic profiles from isolated trophoblasts in culture for 8-hrs (cytotrophoblasts) and 72-hrs
(syncytiotrophoblasts) exposed to metformin will be compared to unexposed trophoblasts from GDM and non-
GDM pregnancies. Live cell, time-lapsed imaging throughout trophoblast maturation (8, 24, 48, 72-hrs in vitro
culture) will be done to visually correlate morphological maturation with gene markers of trophoblast
differentiation and β-hCG production in the presence or absence of metformin cell exposure. Metformin and
GDM must be studied together and concurrently because published trial data (i.e. obesity and polycystic ovarian
syndrome) has shown they are independently associated with the growth and health of the fetus. We
acknowledge metformin has been studied in many organ systems but how it effects the placenta and specifically
the trophoblast cells is poorly understood. We believe that it is important to understand the degree to which
metformin affects the maturation and metabolism of placental trophoblasts and whether epigenetic mechanisms
underlie changes in gene expression patterns that regulate trophoblast function in GDM and non-GDM
placentas. This study will offer new information that may caution the use of metformin in pregnancy and set the
stage for more refined clinical trials."

This study aims to investigate a radically new paradigm of glomerular immune cell homing and to uncover the
underlying cell and molecular mechanisms and their role in physiological and renal inflammatory disease
conditions including diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and lupus nephritis (LN). As an additional translational aim,
these studies will inform the repurposing of current treatments for kidney disease and the development of new
anti-inflammatory therapies. Circulating and kidney resident immune cells are known to preferentially home in
and around the glomerulus compared to other vascular beds in both normal and inflammatory states, suggesting
the presence of unique immunomodulatory mechanisms in the glomerular microcirculation that protect the kidney
filter. However, the underlying cell and molecular mechanisms have been largely unknown. The focus of the
proposed studies is a new function of the cells of the macula densa (MD) which are strategically positioned at
the glomerular vascular entrance and traditionally known to regulate renal and glomerular hemodynamics. Our
laboratory recently identified that MD cells have the highest rate of protein synthesis among all kidney cell types
and they secrete a variety of paracrine-acting angiogenic, cell growth and patterning, and extracellular matrix
signaling proteins. Preliminary work identified the high MD-enrichment of several pathways and genes in the
inflammatory response and cellular infiltration by leukocytes (e.g., Cxcl12, Cxcl14, Ptgs2, Ptges, Anxa1, Ccn1,
Mif) and observed the MD-centric glomerular density and migration of CD44+ and CD8+ T cells in inflammatory
diseases including lupus nephritis. Our central hypothesis is that MD cells drive the preferential glomerular
homing of immune cells by the release of paracrine-acting pro-inflammatory factors including chemokines and
cytokines. This project will use comprehensive experimental approaches including new transgenic mice with
conditional, inducible and optogenetic tools (MD-mTORgof/lof, MD-Ai27, MD-Ai39, CCN1-knockout (KO), CCN1-
GFP mice), models of renal and systemic inflammation (NTS, STZ-DKD, NZM.2328 LN models), in vivo MPM
imaging, MD transcriptome analysis, in vitro cell culture and proteomics, and pre-clinical therapeutic translation.
The specific aims are to (1) Examine the global immunomodulatory role and mechanisms of MD cells under
physiological and renal inflammatory disease conditions, (2) Elucidate the renal anti-inflammatory role of CCN1,
and (3) Test the anti-inflammatory effects of SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). These newly identified MD mechanisms
may be targeted and will inform the development of future anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies."

 There is strong clinical impetus to provide bilateral hearing early in life, not only for safety in navigating the
environment, but also to maximize learning and socializing in mainstreamed settings. Although this topic is an
active area of research, we lack critically important information on how to assess and interpret the impact of age
at onset of deafness and auditory experience in children with bilateral cochlear Implants (CIs). Four groups of
bilateral CI users and normal hearing (NH) participants in the same age ranges will be recruited to test
hypotheses about the role of auditory experience and inter-implant delay in emergence of binaural hearing,
functional listening and cognition. Here we propose novel studies aimed at gaining fresh insight into the role of
auditory experience and inter-implant delay on outcomes. We will integrate perceptual and
electroencephalographical (EEG) measures of binaural integrity (Aim 1), and functional listening with binaural
cues (Aim 2). Further, cognitive measures of executive function (EF) are introduced to promote novel discovery
of the association between binaural listening measures and EF (Aim 3). By synergistically combining these
approaches, this project will be the first to provide urgently needed answers to timely and clinically critical
questions regarding pediatric cochlear implantation. An important barrier to maximizing outcomes stems from
engineering limitations whereby CIs are lacking binaural coordination. In addition, while speech envelope (ENV)
cues are preserved in speech signals, cues that are significant for binaural hearing, namely temporal fine
structure (TFS) cues, are not preserved in CI processing. We will systematically manipulate the control of ENV
and TFS cues by using either research processors that allow exquisite control of timing of stimuli reaching each
electrode or presenting stimuli to clinical processors and in free field, where stimulation is more akin to today’s
CI processing. comprehensive investigation into outcomes in children with bilateral CIs, using perceptual, eye
tracking and EEG measures at multiple levels of auditory processing. The stepwise assessment along the neural
axis, from brainstem to auditory cortex, to cortical connectivity and whole brain coherence analyses, will enable
us to understand which perceptual deficits are associated with abnormal neural processing. Cognitive measures
are introduced to promote novel discovery of how abnormal neural development is related to EF, and if these
effects show pervasive effects beyond auditory-based EF tasks. This information is important for understanding
how the timing of bilateral CIs is related to a set of cognitive processes– regulating attention, memory, and
controlling cognitive behaviors – necessary for success across academic, social, and daily living domains. We
will harness the tests used in our studies to develop a clinical assessment toolbox that can be used by clinicians
to assess binaural hearing abilities, and our findings will further identify which cognitive EF measures should be
use along with auditory measures to clinically assess outcomes in children. Results will inform selection of design
features in engineering CIs, with an emphasis on binaural processors, thus aiming to reduce the gap in
performance relative to NH listeners."

The Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) is an attractive malaria vaccine candidate because
anti-CSP antibodies can block liver invasion and potentially provide sterilizing immunity against the parasite.
However, current vaccines that target CSP, including RTS,S, the most advanced malaria vaccine, elicit
suboptimal protective immunity that wanes dramatically over time. In this proposal, our goal is to engineer new
and more effective vaccines targeting CSP. We will take advantage of the recent identification of potently
protective monoclonal antibodies that target epitopes within novel sites of vulnerability in CSP. We will
specifically target these epitopes using a highly immunogenic bacteriophage virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine
platform technology. In preliminary data, we have shown that VLP-based immunogens targeting short epitopes
within CSP can elicit high-titer and long-lasting antibody responses that inhibit Plasmodium infection of the liver
and can prevent blood-stage infection in mice. In this proposal, we will utilize an arsenal of approaches to
maximize the immunogenicity of VLP-based vaccines (Aim 1), we will use sensitive techniques to carefully
monitor the B cell responses to our vaccines (Aim 2), and we will measure the effectiveness of vaccines in a
state-of-the-art mouse infection model (Aim 3). Our team, which has expertise in vaccine engineering and design,
B cell immunology, and malaria challenge models, will carry out these Aims with the ultimate goal of identifying
a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine candidate suitable of advancing to clinical trials."
10884868,"Project Summary and Abstract
Health behaviors established during emerging adulthood often portend life-long behavior patterns. During this
developmental stage, high-risk alcohol use behavior (binge-drinking) increases, while levels of physical activity
begin to decrease. When considered individually, alcohol use and physical activity have marked and opposing
influences on neurophysiological indicators of health and self-regulation. Acute and chronic alcohol negatively
impact the cardiovascular system, resulting in decreased heart rate variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity.
High-risk drinking is also associated with greater incentive salience of alcohol cues, resulting in an enhanced P3
event-related potential to alcohol related stimuli (ACR-P3). Increased physical activity improves HRV, baroreflex
sensitivity, and neural processes central to P3 amplitude reduction, although ACR-P3 has not been examined.
Paradoxically, greater alcohol consumption consistently has been associated with more frequent physical activity
across the adult lifespan. This raises the question of how the effects of this antagonistic clustering of co-occurring
health-related behaviors accrue on the cardiovascular and neural processes that underlie their regulation. Further,
a few recent studies suggest that this between-person association observed between alcohol use and physical
activity may not reflect within-person drinking-activity relations, and most studies have relied on self-reports of
physical activity. The goal of this study is to measure covariation in alcohol use and physical activity, assessed
retrospectively, as well as objectively over a 7-10 day period to test the cumulative effects of drinking and activity
behaviors on HRV, baroreflex sensitivity, and ACR-P3. The proposed research and training plan leverages the
resources of a NIAAA-supported experiment (R21AA029604) examining whether a brief behavioral manipulation
of the baroreflex loop can alter neural reactivity to alcohol cues in emerging adult binge drinkers. The proposed
study will use simultaneously collected cardiovascular (ECG) and neural (EEG) measures recorded at rest and
during an alcohol-cue reactivity paradigm from two sessions of the parent study, separated by 7-10 days. It will
add on objective monitoring of physical activity during the intersession interval, combined with a time-line follow
back interview of alcohol use and physical activity during the interval. Aim 1 is to examine covariation of alcohol
use and physical activity behaviors assessed by self-report and actigraphy. Aim 2 is to examine the total effects
of alcohol use and physical activity behaviors between sessions on HRV and baroreflex sensitivity (0.1Hz HRV).
Aim 3 is to examine the cumulative effects of alcohol use and physical activity between sessions on incentive
motivation towards alcohol cues, indicated by the ACR-P3. The proposed research and training plan are designed
to address current gaps in understanding between drinking and activity behaviors to neurophysiological indicators
of self-regulation, while providing the applicant with deeper knowledge and skills in alcohol research to support a
developing research program on integrated cardiovascular and neural mechanisms in alcohol and co-occurring
health behaviors."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by T cell destruction of insulin-
producing pancreatic b cells. This results in lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin therapy and
increases the risk of complications in many organ systems. Advances in understanding the
mechanisms by which T cells mediate their autoimmune functions may provide new therapeutic targets
for T1D. It is established that CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells are both required for the development of
T1D. Studies found that the cytokine IL-21 functions as a critical signal produced by CD4 T cells to help
CD8 T cells destroy insulin-producing b cells. However, the direct effects of IL-21 on β cell-reactive
CD8 T cell effector function remain incompletely understood. Therefore, the long-term goal of this
project is to elucidate molecular mechanisms regulating autoreactive CD8 T cell function.
Preliminary scRNA-seq data presented in this proposal identified Pim1 as a possible modulator of
activated diabetogenic CD8 T cell function. PIM1 belongs to a serine/threonine protein kinase family
that functions downstream of the JAK-STAT pathway and is involved in regulating many processes
including cell survival and metabolism. It was also demonstrated that IL-21 induced the expression of
PIM1 and its downstream targets in CD8 T cells, while inhibition of PIM kinase in the presence of IL-21
resulted in reduced expression of PIM1 downstream targets. These data led to the hypothesis that
IL-21-induced PIM1 kinase is necessary for supporting the sustained cytolytic function and
metabolic demands of autoreactive CD8 T cells that are required for T1D development. Aim 1 will
determine the role of PIM1 kinase in β cell-autoreactive CD8 T cell cytolytic function in T1D
development. These experiments will determine if PIM1 is necessary and sufficient for T1D
development. Additionally, the immunological phenotype of autoreactive CD8 T cells following inhibition
and overexpression of PIM1 will be assessed. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of PIM1 kinase in b cell-
autoreactive CD8 T cell signal transduction and metabolism in T1D. This project will be conducted
at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Versiti Blood Research Institute with multidisciplinary support
from experts in immunology and diabetes. Rigorous research and bioinformatic training in addition to
presentations at national meetings and publication of manuscripts in immunology and T1D will support
the development of an independent, academic physician-scientist. Overall, this proposal will advance
knowledge of how b cell-autoreactive CD8 T cells function during the development of T1D. This is in
line with the mission of NIDDK, since the results of this project may identify PIM1 as a novel
therapeutic target for T1D."

Organelles engage in homeostatic processes to improve cellular health. However, some organelle proteins in
the soma can survive many months, making them susceptible to damage during aging. In the germline, gametes
can be arrested for a prolonged period before they pass down their organelle content to the next generation.
Having damage-prone proteins perdure in the germline would therefore be problematic and challenge the ability
of germ cells to pass down healthy material from generation to generation. Upon oocyte maturation and
fertilization, certain maternal products are degraded to initiate the maternal to zygotic transition in the developing
embryo, though little is known how maternally derived organelles are turned over and replaced with zygotic
organelles. Intriguingly, quality control events have been shown to take place in single cell organisms and during
asymmetric divisions to ensure the elimination of organelle long-lived proteins (LLPs). However, whether
specialized organelle quality control takes places to remove maternally derived LLPs in developing progeny, and
how such a process would take place in a multi-cellular organism remains poorly understood. Through molecular
and genetic analysis, the research proposed in this fellowship will investigate how maternal organelle input
derived from Drosophila oocytes influences germline health of their offspring. First, I will endogenously tag well
characterized LLPs to visualize the zygotic pool of proteins along with the maternally derived long-lived pool of
the same protein across embryonic, larval and adult progeny. By differentially tagging the maternal and zygotic
pool, I will compare protein levels in the progeny germline to assess if it selectively prevents maternally deposited
organelle LLPs to be transgenerationally inherited. Next, I will perturb oocyte health to investigate how maternally
damaged LLPs contributes to offspring viability. Finally, I will identify additional long-lived proteins that are
derived from maternal organelles using a biorthogonal amino acid labeling approach and compare their fates in
the progeny germline with well characterized LLPs. The proposed experiments will highlight how maternally
derived LLPs impact organelle function in the germline of ensuing progeny. In addition, these studies will shed
light on how organelle continuity is maintained between generations and aim to reveal specialized quality control
pathways in the germline."

 Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Diaphragm dysfunction is prevalent in
heart failure (HF) patients and both precedes and surpasses that seen in other locomotory skeletal muscles;
increasing susceptibility to respiratory muscle failure and exercise intolerance as well as predisposing these
patients to ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction (VIDD). Impaired vascular function is regularly present
in peripheral skeletal muscles with HF, compromising the blood flow and oxygen delivery required to support
contractile function. However, the role of diaphragm vascular dysfunction in HF-induced diaphragm fatigue,
and whether these changes in diaphragm vasomotor control are exacerbated with prolonged mechanical
ventilation (MV), often employed in this patient population, is not known. Further, cardiovascular dysfunction is
an important contributor to problematic weaning and increased mortality with MV. Prolonged MV in-and-of
itself elicits diaphragm vascular dysfunction, which contributes to weaning failure with MV. HF and MV patients
consistently exhibit increased renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation and elevated levels of circulating
Angiotensin-II (Ang-II), which largely contributes to skeletal muscle vascular dysfunction as well as diaphragm
atrophy in both HF and prolonged MV. These findings suggest that HF patients are predisposed to more
pronounced MV-induced diaphragm vascular dysfunction.
 Preliminary data supports that HF impairs endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation in diaphragm
arterioles, and the added insult of prolonged MV nearly abolishes endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation.
However, the impact of HF combined with prolonged MV on diaphragm blood flow and vasomotor control has
never been determined. Therefore, our global hypothesis is that diaphragm resistance vessel (i.e.
arterioles) function (e.g. endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation) is significantly diminished in HF and
exacerbated with MV. As such, pharmacologically counteracting the vascular effects of Ang-II will
improve diaphragm perfusion and preserve vascular function with prolonged MV and HF + prolonged
MV.
 This project will be completed at Kansas State University (KSU) under the guidance of Drs. Bradley J.
Behnke and David C. Poole. The training plan has been formulated to facilitate the development of technical
proficiencies and critical thinking skills needed to execute the proposed experiments and incorporates the
elements essential for the applicant to transition into an independent scientific career. The Behnke and Poole
Laboratories, and the Departments of Kinesiology and Anatomy and Physiology at KSU represent a rich
scientific environment that will provide outstanding graduate training and a research opportunity to gain new
insights into diaphragm blood flow regulation and vasomotor control in healthy and diseased animal models."

use of nanoparticle mediated delivery is implemented which can offer protection to miRNA in the blood stream
and accumulation at the tumor site which can enhance efficiency of therapy. Thus, the objective of this
study is to employ dual layer magnetic nanoparticle system that is constructed to release miRNA at tumor site.
This nanoparticle formulation can be applied for improved systemic bioavailability, low toxicity, and tumor
targeting of therapeutics. The nanoparticle therapies are highly suitable to target and treat resistant tumors
(castration resistant prostate cancer, CRPC) that affects thousands of men each year. Recent studies
demonstrate miR-205 loss is correlated with prostate cancer (PrCa) progression, metastasis, and drug
resistance. Restoration of miR-205 induces pro-apoptotic, anti-proliferative, and epigenetic modulator roles.
Literature and our preliminary data suggest re-expression of miR-205 in PrCa cells/tumors result in
sensitizing cells to chemotherapy, reverses drug resistance, EMT regulation, and suppression of PrCa growth.
Therefore, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that dual layered magnetic nanoparticles can enhance
the loading capacity of miRNA per particle and delivery to PrCa cells. This study aims to 1) delineate
development of miR-205 nanoparticle formulation, performing its physico-chemical and biological fate,
mechanistic investigations of in vitro uptake, intercellular accumulation of the miRNA, and 2) study in vivo
tracking and biodistribution miR-205 (MRI) that are in nanoparticles, and 3) examination target gene
modulation, and 4) determine improved chemosensitization potential for docetaxel in drug resistant PrCa cells
and relevant orthotopic mouse models. The clinical outcome led us to develop a unique microRNA
nanoplatform, which can be efficient in inhibiting oncogenic pathways that are linked to drug resistance.
Additionally, this award enables Dr. Yallapu to improve and obtain high quality/quantity of preliminary data
and publications to be able to succeed in acquiring non-SCORE research support."

10930816,"OVERALL Abstract 
The vagus nerve is involved in normal physiology, and disturbances in vagal control have been implicated in several pathophysiological conditions. However, there is a lack of information on the physiology of this nerve in humans as well as multi-organ responses to vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), despite over 100,000 VNS implants worldwide to treat epilepsy, depression, anxiety, and gastrointestinal disorders. Likewise, very little is known about how to best optimize VNS settings for existing therapies or how to develop VNS for new therapies. The proposed Research Evaluating Vagal Excitation and Anatomical Linkages (REVEAL) center aims to conduct groundbreaking research on the effect of VNS on four key systems: the autonomic nervous system (ANS), the cardiovascular system, the immune system, and metabolic system. The ambitious scope of the research requires the participation of eight major academic and medical institutions with over 40 participating key personnel, over 140 patients, an External Advisory Board (which includes patient advocates), a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, and an NIH Steering Committee and other NIH personnel. REVEAL will have three aims corresponding to its Cores. The Clinical Core will manage over 140 patients and clinical staff from 8 different institutions to obtain consistent data on VNS effects on ANS, the cardiovascular system, the immune system, and metabolism. The Data and Analysis Core will gather, store, and analyze data from clinical sites to produce publicly available datasets for development of VNS-based therapeutics and other research. The Administration Core will coordinate the work of the REVEAL Cores and stakeholders to meet the goals of NIH SPARC’s VESPA program."
10832464,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establishes a life-long persistent infection by evading the immune system, in part, by direct cell-to-cell viral spread. In solid organ or stem cell transplant recipients, HCMV spread leads to end-organ diseases that can cause death. During pregnancy, HCMV spread causes congenital infection and is a leading cause of congenital disabilities. No HCMV treatment offers a cure, and there is no vaccine. Thus, there is a need for new treatments to limit infection based on novel discoveries in HCMV biology. Viral proteins required for HCMV cell-to-cell spread are known, but the host processes involved in HCMV cell-to-cell spread have received less attention. Clinical strains of HCMV spread most efficiently through cell-to-cell means, but the molecular mechanisms—including host metabolic ones—essential to HCMV cell-to-cell spread are largely unknown. Understanding host mechanisms regulating cell-to-cell spread may lead to new understandings of how to reduce HCMV infection. Our research has uncovered a novel role of metabolite signaling in promoting HCMV spread. This project's overall goal is to mechanistically understand virus-host interactions regulating metabolite signaling essential to HCMV cell-to-cell spread. We found a metabolite in tryptophan metabolism—kynurenine (KYN)—enhances HCMV spread. In addition to its metabolic role, KYN is a signaling messenger. KYN signals through aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We show that activation of AhR supports HCMV replication. Moreover, we found that hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), through its metabolic regulatory function, limits the production of KYN and suppresses HCMV infection. We hypothesize that metabolite-mediated signaling from infected cells to uninfected cells promotes HCMV cell-to-cell spread, which is attenuated by a HIF1α-dependent cellular response. The proposed research will determine molecular mechanisms involved in the enhancement of HCMV infection by KYN-metabolite signaling (aim 1) and define virus-host interactions regulating HIF1α attenuation of HCMV cell-to-cell spread (aim 2). The experimental approach will integrate virus assays, CRISPR/Cas9 engineering, and untargeted metabolomics to understand HCMV biology. Our findings will provide a mechanistic understanding of metabolite signaling and AhR activity in promoting HCMV cell-to-cell spread and the HIF1α-dependent host-response that targets metabolite signaling to reduce infection. Our studies will advance our knowledge in an understudied area of HCMV research that will provide significant steps-forward in developing novel strategies to treat HCMV infection and limit HCMV-related disease."
10829873,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, influenced by genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Environmental factors and gene-environment interactions are poorly understood in AD etiology. Recently the role of glia in Alzheimer’s disease has gained focus, fueled by GWAS discovery of several risk loci in genes related to immune function, and neuronal-glial cell interactions which are essential for synaptic homeostasis and affected in AD. Furthermore, exposure to environmental toxicants such as heavy metals, as well as metalloids, induce epigenetic changes which could alter different neural cell populations accelerating neurodegeneration. To improve our understanding of Alzheimer’s pathogenesis, studies examining how modifiable environmental factors or AD exposome, impact healthy brain aging, glial homeostasis or disease states and neuroinflammation are crucial. Major brain cell types are vulnerable to oxidative stress and both AD and toxicant exposures are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated lipid peroxidation. In this regard the role of nuclear receptors with firmly established role in neurodevelopment, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration is particularly important. Activation of RXR/LXR heterodimers induces critical expression of target genes involved in lipid trafficking, efflux (APOE-ABCA1 axis) and synthesis. Perturbation of the LXR- ABCA1-APOE signaling/metabolic axis and dysregulation of cellular metabolism represent an important potential mechanism by which environmental toxicants could further contribute to AD exposome. We hypothesize exogenous environmental factors induce complex pathophysiological interactions between neurons and glial cells through epigenomic and transcriptional changes, altering healthy brain aging, and increasing Alzheimer’s disease risk through changes in bioenergetics and response to inflammatory stimuli. Environmental arsenic (As) is at the top of the list of toxic substances threatening human health (ATSDR 2017 Substance Priority List). Arsenic can easily pass the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in brain. Low-level As in water has been associated with poor global cognition in adults and induced changes in all three epigenetic markers. To test the hypothesis we will determine: 1) epigenetic and transcriptional alterations following As exposure of distinct neural populations (neurons, microglia, astrocytes) during aging; 2) how exposure to As alters glial response to Alzheimer’s disease related neurodegeneration, and 3) changes in synaptic homeostasis, mitochondrial and LXR related lipid trafficking following As exposure. These studies will better define if and how As exposure, as an important part of the AD exposome, could influence healthy brain aging. Furthermore, we will determine how environmental toxicants could alter AD related pathologies including, glia response, neuroinflammation and brain bioenergetics."

The PREPARE-NS program will develop and establish the psychometric properties of a core set of clinical
outcome assessments (COAs) for nephrotic syndrome, with primary focus on fluid overload (FO). During
the UG3 phase, a diverse team of experts and stakeholders will be convened, in cooperation with the FDA, to
confirm conditions, measures and anchors and design the studies necessary to identify a rigorous and patient-
centered FO endpoint definition and measure set. The UH3 will focus on testing and implementing the core set
of COAs identified in the UG3 phase. The research conducted in the UH3 phase will allow us to refine the FO
COAs. The final activities will be focused on making the final core set of COAs widely available to the public for
use in trials. For both phases, we will work in close consultation with the project stakeholder engagement and
clinician expert panels, drawing from the perspectives of patients, clinicians, regulators, payers, and drug
developers. Tapping these resources, and relying on our team's wide-ranging clinical, COA development, and
psychometric expertise, we will generate a core set of highly-relevant COAs that will advance patient-focused

10844413,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 3rd cause of cancer-related mortality. It is inherently
difficult to treat given the often-times co-occurrence of underlying cirrhosis which exacerbates
conventional chemotherapeutic toxicity. A sizeable number of patients remain non-responsive or
“untreatable,” to cutting edge immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy necessitating the development of new
or augmentative therapies. Given their role in removing foreign nanomaterials as participants of the
mononuclear phagocyte system, coupled to their role in mediating HCC, Kupffer cells (KCs) are an ideal
immunotherapeutic target for small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Small EVs are enriched in exosome
nanovesicles. Our previous studies demonstrate that melanoma and lung cancer sEVs can directly induce
a pro-tumor M2-like Mφ phenotype or be modified with melittin peptide to induce anti-tumor M1-like Mφs.
Theoretically, HCC sEVs might also be modified with melittin to induce anti-tumor M1 KC Mφs.
 The bee venom peptide melittin is a powerful adjuvant for activating M1 immunity. The FDA
approves the use of bee venom injections for bee sting immunotherapy. In this proposal we hypothesize
that (i.) HCC sEVs can be converted into stable melittin adjuvant nanocarriers, and (ii.) melittin-modified
HCC sEVs associate with and induce KCs toward an anti-tumor M1-like phenotype in vivo.
 In aim 1, HCC sEVs will be converted into stable melittin nanocarriers. A fluorescent red,
bioluminescent, 3D HepG2-Red-Fluc spheroid sEV source model will be developed. We will compare 2D
versus 3D HepG2-Red-Fluc sourced natural and melittinized sEVs for their ability to influence primary KC
polarization in vitro and determine differences in M1/M2 polarizing miRNA content using qRT-pcr.
 In aim 2, an orthotopic syngeneic model using bioluminescent Hepa1-6-Fluc-Neo cells in
immunocompetent C57L/6 mice will be used. Natural vs. melittinized Hepa1-6-Fluc-Neo sEVs will be
compared to determine whether they influence KC M1/M2 polarization. We will also assess whether pre-
treatment with melittinized Hepa1-6-Fluc-Neo sEVs inhibits subsequent orthotopic HCC growth. Studies
will be accomplished via utilization of all U of L Hepatobiology & Toxicology COBRE cores.
 The results of these studies will further our understanding of the relationship between natural HCC
sEVs and KC tumor supportive functions, and a therapeutic means to antagonize this pathogenic
relationship using melittin-modified KC sEVs will also be evaluated. Translationally, sEV populations
might be harvested from the blood of HCC patients, modified into personalized immunotolerant
nanomedicines using melittin, or other agents and re-administered. The proposed studies also serve as a
platform to pursue pathologic and therapeutic sEV investigations concerning other Mφ driven liver
diseases including hepatitis, alcoholic and non-alcoholic-SH, and liver fibrosis."
10844417,"Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) carries a high morbidity and mortality, and has no FDA approved therapy.
Sustained hepatic inflammation is an important factor in progression of alcoholic liver disease and elevated
hepatic and circulating levels of CCL2 and CXCL2 chemokines are seen in both early and later stages of liver
disease. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in alcohol-induced upregulation of these chemokines
are not completely elucidated. Emerging evidence indicates that alcohol affects epigenetic regulatory
mechanisms and thus significantly contributes to the development of hepatic pathology. Post-translational
modifications (PTMs) specifically, acetylation is important for gene transcription and is maintained by Histone
deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferases (HATs). In this regard, we have shown that binge
alcohol exposure alters expression of hepatic HDAC and also affect global hepatic histone H3 acetylation. The
role of Class I HDACs has been also described in inflammation with a particular pro-inflammatory role for
HDAC3. In the context of chemokine expression, our preliminary data, examining the effects of chronic ethanol
on CCL2 upregulation showed that in correlation with increased promoter histone acetylation, there was an
increase in the binding of critical transcription factor NFB-p65 to the CCL2 promoter. Further, the data show
that a dietary HDAC inhibitor (tributyrin - prodrug of butyrate) attenuates alcohol-induced CCL2 and CXCL2
expression, neutrophil infiltration and prevents hepatic inflammation and injury. Based on these findings, we
hypothesize that chronic alcohol-induced alterations in hepatic HDACs drive pathogenic
posttranslational modifications of histones and non-histone proteins specifically transcription factor
NFB, upregulating CCL2 and CXCL2 chemokines expression contributing to liver inflammation and
injury. The major goal of this proposal is to conduct studies that determine the molecular mechanisms
underlying chronic alcohol-induced chemokine upregulation and the development of ALD. Moreover, the
proposal examines the potential of nutrition-based interventions targeted at HDAC inhibition in mitigating
alcohol-induced chemokine expression and liver inflammation/injury. The specific aims of the proposal are: 1)
Examine the role of alcohol-induced promoter histone modifications in regulating pro-inflammatory
CCL2 and CXCL2 chemokine expression in ALD; 2) Determine the role of HDAC mediated regulation of
NFB transactivation function and chemokine expression in ALD; and 3) Evaluate the therapeutic
potential of tributyrin in attenuating CCL2 and CXCL2 chemokine expression and development of ALD.
We expect that the results of our study will provide critical molecular insights and facilitate the development of
therapeutic interventions for ALD."
10823253,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is the progressive weakening and dilation of the aorta. A substantial
knowledge gap exists in the understanding of molecular mechanisms responsible for aneurysm rupture, the
major cause of mortality among AAA patients. Following our prior report of elevated thrombospondin-1 (TSP1)
in human and mouse aneurysmal tissues, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and
identified macrophages (Mɸs) being the primary source of elevated TSP1 in mouse aneurysmal aorta. We
subsequently generated Mɸ-specific Thbs1 knockout mice (Thbs1∆Mɸ) by crossing Lyz2-Cre with our newly
constructed Thbs1flox/flox mice. When subjected to aneurysm induction by angiotensin II (Ang II) coupled with
hypercholesterolemia, over 60% of Thbs1∆Mɸ died due to AAA rupture, an incidence that was 2.6 times higher
than Thbs1wt. Intriguingly, Thbs1∆Mɸ mice that survived to the end of 28-day Ang II infusion showed less aneurysm
dilation than Thbs1wt. Smaller aneurysmal expansion was also found when Thbs1∆Mɸ mice were challenged with
perivascular application of CaCl2, an AAA model that does not produce rupture. We propose two specific aims
to delineate the mechanisms through which Mɸ-specific Thbs1 gene deletion differentially affects aortic
dilation and rupture with an emphasis on AAA rupture. Specific Aim 1 devotes to establishing the rupture-
preventive function of Mɸ TSP1. Specifically, we will determine the aortic responses proceeding lethal rupture in
male and female Thbs1∆Mɸ mice in the Ang II model followed by identifying rupture-associated molecular
signatures through scRNA-seq, in situ hybridization and immunostaining. Furthermore, we will examine the
effects of Mɸ-specific Thbs1 knockout using a different murine model that produces rupture in advanced stages
of aneurysm, which is more relevant to human AAA than the early rupture produced by the Ang II model. Specific
Aim 2 focuses on investigating molecular mechanisms of aneurysm rupture. Preliminary studies showed that
compared to wildtype, Thbs1-/- Mɸs had significantly reduced ability to migrate or to engulf apoptotic cells as well
as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). We will test whether Mɸ TSP1 promotes NET clearance through CD47-
mediated actin polymerization. Next, we will establish the causal effect of impaired Mɸ migration and
phagocytosis on aneurysm rupture of Thbs1∆Mɸ mice. We will first determine whether NET burden is increased
in Thbs1∆Mɸ died from rupture, and the spatial relationship between NETs and Mɸs. Second, we will test whether
restoring Mɸ migration in Thbs1∆Mɸ reduces NET accumulation via adoptive transfer strategies. Furthermore, we
will examine whether enhancing or attenuating NET clearance affect aneurysm rupture in Thbs1∆Mɸ. Lastly, we
will analyze TSP1 expression and its association with Mɸ and NET accumulation in ruptured and non-ruptured
human AAA tissues. By dissecting the multifaceted functions of Mɸs through TSP1 manipulations, this project
will produce significant impact on the understanding of aneurysm rupture."
10827953,"Abstract
Over a thousand human genes have dedicated roles in the ubiquitin pathway, making it one of the most
complex signaling systems. About 650 of these genes encode ubiquitin ligases (E3s), which recognize
substrates and target them for degradation. Our laboratory has developed several methods, based on both cell
biological and affinity approaches, to identify substrates of ubiquitin ligases, and have used these to identify
over two dozen substrates of five ligases. However, like phosphorylation, in many cases loss of ubiquitination
has no obvious phenotype. We have used the R35 mechanism to completely re-configure ourselves into a
mammalian cell laboratory and undertaken a large screen to identify phenotypes for poorly understood human
E3s/DUBs. We created a CRISPR library against human E3s/DUBs and performed a pooled CRISPR-Cas9
screen combined with chemical inhibition of 41 compounds targeting genome integrity, cell cycle progression,
transcription, RNA processing, translation, mitochondrial function, protein folding, metabolic pathways,
transport, cytoskeleton, etc. By probing a diverse set of biological processes for E3/DUB involvement, we
were able to assess the specificity of these interactions. Overall, we identified one or more specific interactions
for 161 E3/DUBs (about 25% of those examined), many of which were previously unstudied. Some genes,
such as FBXW7, showed interactions with more than one-third of the compounds. Others showed interactions
only with a single compound or a set of related compounds. We are focusing our efforts on following up four
sets of ligases: mutants in the poorly studied RING ligase RNF25 were extremely sensitive to alkylating
agents, but not other forms of DNA damage; mutants in the unstudied CUL5 adaptor WSB2 were exquisitely
sensitive to inhibitors of nuclear export; the CUL4 adaptor DCAF7 has a role in maintaining viability during a
CDK4/6 arrest; and the poorly-characterized F-box protein FBXO42 has clear roles in mitosis. We will use both
genetic screens and our established mass spec approaches to identify the relevant substrates of these ligases.
In addition, we will continue with our analysis of ubiquitin linkages. We have carried out a large genetic
interaction screen in yeast to identify roles of individual ubiquitin linkages. We will expand upon this screen and
will carry out complementary mass spectrometry approaches to identify relevant substrates."
10827423,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Mechanism of Divalent Metal Transport by Nramp-Family Transporters
Background: Metals like iron and manganese are essential to many physiological processes
including oxygen transport and energy metabolism. But excess or deficiency of these ions leads
to health issues—including anemia, hemochromatosis and immune or neurological disorders—
and their physiological levels are thus tightly regulated. Nramps (natural resistance-associated
macrophage proteins) are symporters that import metal ions and protons into cells, and thus are
crucial to maintaining transition metal homeostasis. However, the mechanism of coupling
between metal ions and protons is unclear. Structures of bacterial Nramps revealed the binding
site for the transition metal ion substrate and a proton pathway formed by a polar residue network
in the protein scaffold. Furthermore, evidence is emerging that distant Nramp homologs have
variations of the metal-binding sequence motifs and transport other metals like Al3+ and Mg2+.
Proposed Research: Our goal is two-fold: (i) develop an atomic-level biophysical understanding
of the canonical mechanistic features shared by most eukaryotic and bacterial Nramps; and (ii)
contrast these features to those in more distant Nramp-like homologs. We combine sequence
bioinformatics and other computational approaches with structural and biochemical analyses. In
Aim 1, we investigate canonical features of Nramp transporters using a well-established bacterial
Nramp model system. We will determine (1a) the metal ion coordination geometry and affinity and
selectivity determinants, (1b) whether proton transport is thermodynamically coupled to metal
transport, and (1c) how protonation states of the protein alter conformational dynamics. In Aim 2,
we investigate divergent Nramp homologs with noncanonical metal-binding and proton-pathway
sequence motifs. We examine how these sequence changes affect (2a) proton transport, (2b)
metal selectivity, and (2c) metal coordination geometries. Our two aims synergize to provide in-
depth biophysical mechanisms and a broad perspective of this important family of transporters.
Impact: Both bacterial and mammalian Nramps impact human health. In bacteria, Nramps help
commensal microbes acquire essential transition metals and promote colonization by pathogens.
Human Nramps are essential for immunity to intracellular pathogens, liver and blood homeostasis,
and brain function. This research on metal ion transport by Nramps provides the biochemical and
biophysical grounding necessary to explain their essential role in metal homeostasis at the cellular
and organismal level. This knowledge could lead to better therapies for metal-related diseases
including anemia, hemochromatosis, and many immune and neurological disorders."
10829425,"SUMMARY
Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis are pathogenic members of the order Bacillales that each
represent a considerable threat to global public health. The rise of S. aureus strains resistant to all known
antimicrobials has the potential to eliminate available treatment options whereas the successful use of B.
anthracis as an agent of bioterror threatens national security. Identifying novel therapeutic targets against
these organisms is critical to our continued ability to protect against these infections. Promising antimicrobial
targets include bacterial stress sensing and detoxification systems as both processes are required for infection.
Alterations in gene expression in response to stress can be orchestrated by signal transduction proteins known
as two-component regulatory systems (TCSs). Bacteria typically encode many TCSs that are responsible for
recognizing and responding to distinct signals, enabling adaptation to diverse environments. We have
identified and functionally characterized two TCSs named EdsRS and HitRS that trigger the response to cell
envelope damage as a strategy to defend against phagocyte-dependent killing. EdsRS is conserved in both S.
aureus and B. anthracis whereas HitRS is only present in B. anthracis, suggesting that HitRS may have
evolved to enable the intracellular lifecycle of this organism. In this proposal, we describe the discovery of
additional regulatory factors that govern signal transduction through EdsRS and HitRS, including known
enzymes as well as previously unstudied factors involved in RNA expression and stability. The combined
activities of these regulatory factors enable transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational control of
TCS signaling. Based on these discoveries, we propose a model whereby HitRS and EdsRS signal
transduction is controlled by accessory proteins that enable a coordinated and tightly controlled response to
host-mediated barrier damage. We propose that tight regulation of EdsRS and HitRS is required for survival
within macrophages and subsequent pathogenesis. This model uncovers new regulatory proteins that control
TCS signal transduction, expanding the small but rapidly growing catalogue of known TCS accessory proteins.
We will test this model through a series of interconnected specific aims that define the mechanism of control of
HitRS and EdsRS signal transduction, elucidate the cascade of events leading to HitRS and EdsRS activation
during infection, and uncover host factors that target the cell envelope of Gram positive bacteria and trigger
HitRS and EdsRS signaling. Due to the fundamental requirement for TCS in bacterial stress sensing, these
studies will be universally relevant to the field of microbial signal transduction."

PAI-1-mediated early-onset endometrial cancer
Over the last 15 years, an increase in obesity-associated endometrial cancer has been observed, coinciding
with the globesity epidemic in the US. These patients are 15-30 years younger than the typical patient
demographics, and thus experience clinical burden linked to fertility preservation and disease recurrence. To
understand the contribution of obesity to early-onset endometrial cancer, we recently found increased
infiltration of adipose stromal cells (ASCs) in endometrial microenvironments of obese patients. Preliminary
studies implicate that ASCs directly influence expression changes of loci associated with intercellular
permeability and polarity (IPP) in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs). Single-cell transcriptomic profiling has
further identified that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), an abundant ASC-secreted adipokine, plays a
key role in deregulating IPP functions. Therefore, we hypothesize that aberrant PAI-1 signaling interferes with
IPP transcription, disrupting intercellular communication homeostasis to promote neoplastic EECs. In Aim 1,
the contribution of ASC-secreted PAI-1 to transcription reprogramming of IPP will be determined in EEC
exposure models. When PAI-1 is tethered to LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) on the cell surface, the
internalized signaling engenders E3 ubiquitin-mediated degradation of SMAD4 that attenuates TGFβ tumor-
suppressive transcription program. Single-cell proteomic profiling will confirm whether IPP repression
preferentially occurs in SMAD4-underexpressed cell subpopulations of primary tumors in young obese
patients. In Aim 2, phenotypic influences of PAI-1 on cellular transformation will be assessed in EEC exposure
models with IPP knockdowns or knockins. Dye-transfer assay and atomic force microscopy will be used to
probe intercellular properties of permeability and polarity in EECs and to determine whether these altered
biophysical features represent a neoplastic phenotype of EECs. When validated in a tissue microarray panel of
230 tumors and 30 uninvolved normal samples (sample size justified), decreased expression of candidate loci
is expected to correlate with the young age of patients with high body mass indices (BMIs). In Aim 3, PAI-1-
mediated recruitment of DNA methyltransferases will be examined in susceptible IPP loci. Persistent exposure
of EECs to PAI-1 will facilitate methylation propagation within IPP promoters, leaving permanent epigenetic
footprints in the neoplastic progeny. When confirmed in an endometrial cancer cohort, increased DNA
methylation of these candidate loci is frequently present in primary tumors of young obese patients. The
proposed study not only gives insights into a novel role of PAI-1 in early-onset endometrial cancer, but also
identifies epigenetic biomarkers for cell-free DNA monitoring of young patients at risk of developing future
recurrence."

Our recent studies have established a new paradigm that the chronic kidney disease – mineral bone disorder
(CKD-MBD) syndrome is partly caused by release of factors that are induced during attempted kidney repair into
the circulation. These studies have shown systemic activation of activin receptor type IIA (ActRIIA) in CKD and
identified ActRIIA signaling as a potential therapeutic target for the CKD-MBD and renal fibrosis. Chronic Kidney
Disease (CKD) is a pandemic associated with high cardiovascular mortality rates. The causes of the high
cardiovascular mortality risk include CKD-MBD components. The CKD-MBD syndrome is a uniform complication
of CKD beginning after significant kidney injury reduces GFR by 10% or more. The available therapeutic options
attacking the CKD-MBD - phosphate binders, vitamin D analogs, and calcimimetics, target late stages of the
syndrome and not its pathogenesis or the cardiovascular complications directly, and have failed to show
cardiovascular benefit in clinical trials. Thus, there is great need for discoveries related to CKD-MBD
pathogenesis and identification of therapeutic targets for the CKD-MBD cardiovascular components. CKD
modulates ActRIIA signaling in the vasculature, heart, skeleton and kidney. ActRIIA signaling contributes to
vascular, skeletal, and cardiac complications of kidney disease. The studies in this application propose to
identify the mechanism by which ActRIIA is activated in CKD focusing on ligand stimulation by Activin
A. Inducible knockdown strategies and monoclonal antibody to activin A will be used to determine the role of
activin A in ActRIIA activation in CKD. Vascular, skeletal and cardiac tissues will be studied for mechanism of
disease and mechanism of ActRIIA activation. The vascular aim 1 studies will validate ActRIIA as a therapeutic
target in the vascular calcification of the CKD-MBD. In skeletal aim 2 studies, the mechanism of CKD stimulated
osteoblast dysfunction and bone resorption and abnormal remodeling is sought. In the cardiac aim 3 studies, the
mechanism of CKD stimulated cardiac hypertrophy will be sought focusing on cardiac energetics and the
regulation by perioxosome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) confirming the role
of ActRIIA and validating it as a therapeutic target. Successful completion of the proposed studies will establish
that the vascular, skeletal and cardiac components of the CKD-MBD are caused by activin A as an ActRIIA
ligand, establishing it as a therapeutic target in the CKD-MBD and CKD, and support new clinical trials in the
CKD-MBD and in the progression of CKD."
10737636,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a ubiquitous Gram-negative bacteria and opportunistic pathogen that is of
considerable medical importance due to its multidrug resistance and tendency to form antibiotic resistant
biofilms. During PA infection, a strong innate immune response is generated by phagocytes, including
neutrophils and macrophages, in the form of the respiratory burst (RB). Although many bactericidal agents are
generated during the RB, a leading DNA-damaging and PMF (proton motive force) perturbing oxidant is
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). PA is exposed to phagocyte-derived H2O2 in a number of disease settings, including
cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, burns/blast/surgical/diabetic wounds and urinary tract
infections. PA defense against H2O2 is governed by the DNA-binding transactivator OxyR. Of the numerous PA
genes under OxyR control, optimal resistance to H2O2 requires activation of a two gene operon encoding katb
and ankb, which encode two proteins strategically deployed to the periplasm. KatB is a group 1 heme b-type
catalase that converts H2O2 into H2O and O2 and AnkB is a putative ankyrin repeat protein of unknown function.
The overall goal of this multi-PI exploratory R21 application is to combine the structural, biophysical, and
biochemical expertise of the Kovall lab with the microbial physiology, biofilm, and genetics expertise of the
Hassett lab in order to elucidate the novel functions of AnkB and KatB in response to exogenous H2O2. Our
preliminary data supports the hypothesis that AnkB is a novel heme binding protein that is required to transfer
heme to monomeric KatB in order to facilitate the formation of catalytically active KatB tetramers. This
mechanism is likely an important feature of the in vivo confrontation between PA and the H2O2 component of the
RB mediated by phagocytic cells during PA infection. To achieve our overall goal and test our hypothesis, we
will pursue the following two specific aims. Aim 1: Determine the structures and define the functions of AnkB and
KatB. Aim2: Determine the role of AnkB and KatB in planktonic vs. biofilm-forming PA in response to H2O2.
Completion of these exploratory, structural, mechanistic, and highly translational studies will begin to uncover
the role of AnkB and KatB in protecting PA from H2O2 and will likely lead to important functional insights into the
overall behavior of PA during infection associated with various important human diseases."
10770490,"Project Summary: Low levels of physical activity (PA) are common in individuals who use wheelchairs due to
physical disability. Wheelchair users (WU) are also at greater risk for obesity and cardiometabolic health-related
diseases compared to the general population. Regular PA is widely recognized as being beneficial to
the health of persons without a disability and is believed to hold similar benefits for WU. However, WU face
barriers to PA, including considerable lack of accessible, community-based facilities, limited access to adapted
equipment, lack of knowledge on how to exercise safely, and proper support. Additionally, it is unclear what
type of PA intervention is most effective to facilitate WU in achieving current PA recommendations and
reversing or preventing cardiometabolic health-related diseases. Thus, evaluating a structured, community-based
PA training intervention with education and support is critical and will have significant implications for
WU health, future PA guidelines for WU, and the activities of community-based organizations serving WU. The
extensive health benefits of aerobic and strength training are well established for the general population, and
randomized controlled trials studying the impact of PA for WU suggest programs that provide support and
education in accessible, community-based environments are effective for improving outcomes such as
strength and pain. However, there is insufficient evidence on whether these interventions result in
cardiometabolic health (i.e., VO2peak) improvements in WU. Previous evidence demonstrates these
interventions may be inadequate to reach the recommended frequency, intensity, and duration of PA.
Preliminary data suggest guiding PA intensity may be essential to improving cardiometabolic health outcomes
in WU. The current study proposes a hybrid I randomized controlled trial to test the cardiometabolic effects of
a tailored intensity-controlled physical activity training (I PAT) intervention compared to education and access
to a community-based accessible gym (EA). The following specific aims will be tested in WU randomized to
either the IPAT or the EA intervention groups (N = 54 for both). Specific Aim #1: To compare the effectiveness
of the IPAT to EA on cardiorespiratory fitness, vascular function, and body composition. Specific Aim #2: To
identify barriers and facilitators to WU engaging in PA at a community-based, accessible gym. Specific Aim #3:
To examine the mediators (e.g., self-efficacy) and moderators (e.g., age, race, duration of disability) of the
expected intervention effect to understand differences in physiologic response. Moderate-to-vigorous intensity
aerobic and strength training will be used to study the effects of interventions delivered in a community-based
accessible gym on cardiometabolic related health outcomes such as cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) and
vascular function (endothelial function) in WU. Successful completion of the proposed study will generate data
to inform future PA guidelines and strengthen the evidence base for safe and effective PA interventions."
10750961,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Seasonal influenza A (IAV) and other airborne viral pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 represent a substantial
burden on global public health. While sterilizing immunity can be attained through neutralizing antibodies,
seasonal antigenic drift permits viral evasion of humoral immunity, which necessitates annual reformulation of
the seasonal influenza vaccine. It has previously been shown, that cross-reactive CD8+ T cells can provide
heterosubtypic non-sterilizing immunity to IAV. However, this cross-protection is relatively short-lived in the
context of a singular antigen exposure. Our lab has shown that lung tissue resident memory T cells (lung Trm)
contribute to this strain transcending cross-protection and that the waning in numbers of IAV-specific Trm strongly
correlate with this loss of IAV cross-protection. Importantly, we have found that multiple exposures to the same
IAV antigens (boosting) can extend the longevity of these lung Trm populations, and as a result, provide extended
heterosubtypic immunity. There still exists a substantial knowledge gap regarding why lung Trm cells are so short
lived when they are clearly important for protection. Addressing this question remains a critical step in the rational
design of universal influenza vaccines. Our long-term goal is to understand the biology that underlies the
waning of lung Trm cells and to harness this information to aid in the development of broadly protective
influenza vaccines. We will address this long-term goal with the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine the molecular T cell intrinsic factors that permit extended longevity and functionality of lung
Trm following multiple antigen exposures.
Aim 2: Define the optimal priming and boosting vaccination strategies to maximize Trm generation, re-
invigoration, and function."

During development, cells undergo dynamic changes in gene expression that are required for appropriate cell
fate specification. Although developmental gene expression is best studied in terms of transcriptional regulation,
the regulation of mRNA degradation may also have important contributions to these expression patterns. Defects
in mRNA decay machinery have been linked to diseases with distinct phenotypes, such as osteosarcoma and
neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the widespread degradation of maternal mRNAs in all animals during
early embryogenesis is critical for the control of development to switch from maternally provided to zygotically
encoded products. Studies of maternal and zygotic mRNA decay dynamics have established that transcript
stability is largely regulated by the binding of protein or RNA factors to cis-regulatory elements within the 3’
untranslated region (3’ UTR) of transcripts. Codon usage is another major determinant of mRNA stability, as
translation can affect mRNA stability in a codon-dependent manner. Considering the great diversity of RNA-
binding proteins and small RNAs in eukaryotes, along with alternative splicing and polyadenylation, the
regulation of mRNA degradation has the potential to be highly complex. This complexity may shape precise gene
expression patterns during development, though the extent of developmentally regulated zygotic mRNA
degradation is unclear. To explore this, I am studying zygotic mRNA degradation in Caenorhabditis elegans
throughout embryonic development. In Aim 1, I will generate a transcriptome-wide map of mRNA decay rates
throughout embryogenesis with spatial and temporal resolution. Transcript half-lives will be determined using
single cell RNA-sequencing to measure mRNA abundance in embryonic cells treated with a transcription inhibitor.
To validate half-lives measured by this transcription inhibition approach, I will use metabolic labeling and
degradation of RNA polymerase II as two orthogonal methods to measure decay rates. Mechanisms of
differential mRNA degradation, namely genes with different rates of decay in different cell types, will be explored
using a transgene approach. In Aim 2, I will establish the roles of the major 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′ mRNA decay
pathways in development. I will identify mRNA targets of both pathways through RNA-sequencing of staged
embryos depleted of the cognate exoribonuclease. Genes that are significantly upregulated compared to control
embryos will be treated as putative targets. Additionally, I will determine the roles of both pathways in cell fate
specification by analyzing cell fate marker expression in exoribonuclease-depleted embryos using live imaging.
By characterizing mRNA decay rates across cell types and developmental stages and establishing mechanisms
of differential mRNA degradation, I will begin to uncover the role of zygotic mRNA turnover in embryonic cell fate
specification. Such findings will provide a more comprehensive understanding of regulatory strategies used
during embryogenesis to mediate developmental transitions and patterning."
10828306,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transgender (TG) individuals have high prevalence of depression (64%) and are nearly nine times as likely to
attempt suicide compared to the general population. Studies have not consistently collected data related to TG
identity nor have they used the recommended two-step method of asking for assigned sex at birth and current
gender identity. This population is largely overlooked in epidemiologic studies due to small sample size. With
inconsistent and inaccurate ascertainment of TG patients in real-world data sources, TG people are missed
and their health trends over time are understudied. Researchers are unable to identify and meaningfully
address mental health inequities for this population, which can further exacerbate and perpetuate psychiatric
conditions. It remains unclear what the health care utilization trends are for TG patients with psychiatric
disorders and their adherence and persistence to psychiatric medications over time. Understanding this
population’s mental health using large datasets is imperative in order to optimize the care management of
psychiatric conditions experienced by TG people.
The objectives of this proposal are to: (1) apply and evaluate the performance of existing computational
phenotypes (CPs) to identify TG patients with depressive disorders (DD), anxiety, and attention deficit
disorders (ADD), (2) assess adherence and prevalence of psychiatric medications among TG patients
diagnosed with psychiatric disorders compared to cisgender patients with these diagnoses, and (3)
examine the risk of non-fatal self-harm among TG patients with psychiatric disorders receiving
psychotherapy compared to TG patients not receiving psychotherapy. For all aims, IBM MarketScan from
years 2008 to 2020 will be used, which is a large, longitudinal medical claims database that includes
inpatient and outpatient visits and prescription medication use. The completion of the proposed aims will
provide real-world evidence on mental health care for TG individuals in the United States.
The training plan outlined in this proposal will equip the applicant with critical knowledge and necessary
skills in social and pharmacoepidemiology and transgender mental health. This plan will prepare him to
successfully complete the proposed aims and to progress into a role as an independent, interdisciplinary
researcher studying the intersection of pharmacoepidemiology and transgender health equity in the US.
The applicant is extremely well supported by an interdisciplinary group of social, psychiatric, and
pharmacoepidemiology faculty, health disparities researchers, and pharmaceutical researchers with the
requisite expertise to support his doctoral research and prepare him for the next phase of his career."
10976407,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide and the bacteria that
cause them are becoming increasing resistant to frontline antibiotics. As a result, last resort antibiotics, like
fosfomycin, are beginning to be more frequently prescribed. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which is
the primary cause of UTIs, can become resistant to fosfomycin, through mutations that impair the function or
production of the UhpT transporter, which imports fosfomycin into the bacterial cell. The current paradigm is
that such mutations come at a fitness tradeoff because impairment of UhpT limits the import of the glycolysis
intermediate glucose-6-phosphate. However, my preliminary data indicate that mutations that lead to
increased resistance to fosfomycin by abrogating uhpT expression, do not impede colonization of the host
urinary tract. In fact, loss of fosfomycin import demonstrates increased persistence during long-term infection.
Additionally, I have shown that 77% of screened UPEC clinical isolates harbor fosfomycin resistant
subpopulations. This raises the alarming hypothesis that fosfomycin resistant subpopulations arise
during UTI, possibly in response to a host-imposed stress and may provide additional fitness
advantages for the pathogen. I will test this hypothesis through two specific aims which will: determine the
contribution of fosfomycin resistant subpopulations to UPEC pathogenesis (Aim 1) and elucidate the basis of
prolonged bacteriuria during UPEC pathogenesis following loss of uhpBA (Aim 2). Together my studies will
provide insights that will ultimately help us curb the onset and propagation of resistance to one of the last-
resort antibiotic agents, by thoroughly elucidating novel mechanisms that lead to fosfomycin resistance during
infection and gauging their fitness advantages and disadvantages in comparison to their parental strains.
Through the execution of these aims, I will cultivate valuable skills in genomic analysis, advanced microscopy
techniques, eukaryotic cell culture, and comprehensive analysis of host-pathogen interactions."
10932840,"Project Summary/Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, is a complex disease
that results in long-term inflammation within the intestine. Approximately 3.1 million individuals in the United
States are currently living with IBD with 70,000 newly identified cases each year. This presents a significant
financial burden on individuals and the economy, costing over $14.6 billion annually in the United States.
Patients with IBD experience cycles of inflammation and tissue damage followed by periods of repair and
remission. The majority of immunotherapies for IBD treatment have been focused on modifying the immune
response, which are highly effective, but nearly a third of patients relapse within 12 months. Redirecting our
focus on how the mucosa is repaired will likely provide an added benefit in IBD treatment when coupled with
immune modulating therapies. The unique ability of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) to self-renew and
differentiate into functional epithelial cells makes them an indispensable component of tissue repair. In the
gut, different populations of damage-associated ISCs exist, including a ISC population that emerges during
colitis-associated inflammation. To better understand this population, we developed a 3-D murine organoid
model system that enriches for these cells. This system will be utilized to study how cell metabolism impacts
the reparative function of colitis-associated ISCs. The use of metabolite analysis via mass spectrometry and
metabolic bioenergetic analysis using a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer will allow us to generate a metabolic
profile for these cells. We are also developing a novel mouse reporter line to study how glucose
transporters impact the reparative function of colitis-associated ISCs in an intestinal injury-repair model of
inflammation. Successful completion of this grant will allow us to better understand how the cell metabolism
of colitis-associated ISCs impacts mucosal healing. Our long-term goal is to identify biomarkers of colitis-
associated ISCs to define mucosal healing and disease remission more accurately. A better understanding
of the molecular processes that influence colitis-associated ISC function will encourage the development of
novel therapeutics that help to regenerate the damaged epithelium. This work is being conducted at the
Rangos Research Center of UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh, which
is an outstanding research environment that provides the trainee with the physical resources, research
cohorts, and intellectual resources to successful complete this work. The detailed training plan designed will
help develop the trainee’s scientific expertise in ISC metabolism, biomarker discovery, and IBD, and
facilitate the transition into an independent investigator in IBD research."
10877679,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Maintenance of an intact intestinal barrier is critical to prevent microbial activation of mucosal immunity. In
inflammatory bowel disease, this barrier is compromised, thus exposing the mucosal immune system to the
contents of the intestinal lumen. A substantial increase in the shedding or extrusion of epithelial cells into the
lumen has been shown to be a predictor of relapse in Crohn’s disease (CD) patients. gd intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IEL) migrate extensively within the epithelial compartment to serve as a first line of defense
against invasive microorganisms and facilitate apoptotic cell shedding. Although gd IELs are protective in
mouse models of colitis, the involvement of these sentinel lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of chronic ileitis is
less clear. Published reports provide conflicting evidence regarding the contribution of gd IELs in the
pathogenesis of chronic ileitis; however, we now show that inducible depletion of gd T cells prior to disease
initiation increases lethality. Further, detailed immunoprofiling of the IEL compartment in mice that develop
spontaneous CD-like ileitis indicates that the loss of gd IELs coincides with the histological onset of ileal
inflammation, suggesting that loss of gd IELs may be an initiating event. In support of this, we observe a
reduction in the frequency of CD39+ gd Tregs, while less activated, peripheral Vg1+ T cells infiltrate the IEL
compartment prior to disease development. Therefore, we propose to interrogate the contribution of gd IELs in
the pathogenesis of chronic ileitis and elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the
dysregulation of the gd IEL compartment during the development of CD-like ileitis. To address these questions,
we will take advantage of unique gd T-cell-specific mouse models and intravital microscopy to define how gd
IEL motility and effector function are regulated in the events leading up to the onset of chronic ileitis. By
combining temporal and cell-specific gene targeting, cutting-edge live imaging techniques, and novel models to
analyze gd IEL function ex vivo, we expect to clearly elucidate the contribution of gd IELs to the development of
ileal disease and further define the functional dysregulation within gd IEL subpopulations in the context of
chronic inflammation. Developing a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in
gd IEL immunosurveillance and immunoregulation may elucidate additional targets for future therapies
designed to reinforce the epithelial barrier and prevent disease relapse."
10867275,"Infectious agents have infected prokaryotes and eukaryotes throughout evolution. Indeed, there is co-evolution
of organisms and their infectious agents, with development of protective responses in the hosts and adaptive
countermeasures by the infectious agents. Infectious endemic retroviruses like murine leukemia virus (MLV)
have existed in mice for millions of years and provide us with an outstanding model system to understand how
mammalian hosts suppress virus replication and conversely, how viruses counteract this restriction. One system
of viral restriction is conferred by the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic peptide 3 (A3) family of
proteins, which are packaged into retroviruses in virion-producing cells and after infection of target cells, either
block reverse transcription or deaminate deoxycytidine residues in single-stranded DNA, resulting in uracils and
G-to-A mutations in the viral genome. The products of retrovirus reverse transcription (ssRNA, ssDNA and
dsDNA) are also sensed by host nucleic acid sensors. Sensor binding to viral nucleic acid leads to the production
of anti-viral cytokines and chemokines, such as type I interferons, which “warns” surrounding cells to arm
themselves against infection by producing proteins such as A3. These host anti-viral events are believed to occur
largely in the cytoplasm, where A3 proteins and many host sensors are believed to function.
 Retroviruses enter cells when the viral and host membranes fuse and capsids are deposited in the
cytoplasm. Reverse transcription initiates from within the capsid and capsid dissociation and reverse
transcription are mutually dependent; because DNA is more rigid than RNA, without capsid dissociation, reverse
transcription cannot proceed and conversely, the generation of DNA facilitates capsid dissociation. The reverse
transcription complex not only consists of viral RNA, DNA and the viral proteins reverse transcriptase and
integrase, but viral capsid and other proteins such as the MLV protein p12, which is needed for tethering of the
proviral DNA to host chromatin to achieve integration.
 Recently, there has been much debate as to whether reverse transcription occurs solely in the cytoplasm or
in the nucleus or both. Our lab pioneered the use of in vivo mouse models to study how A3 proteins restrict
retrovirus infection and has used A3 and nucleic acid sensor knockout (KO) mice and genetically engineered
animals that express human A3 proteins in these studies. Our data, based on our analysis of A3 KO mice and
cells, suggest that the initial step occurs in the cytoplasm but that reverse transcription may also occur in the
cytoplasm. With these mouse models, we have the tools to carry out in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo studies to
determine how A3-mediated restriction and sensing of reverse transcripts are integrated with reverse
transcription and nuclear entry for MLV and its natural host, the mouse. To accomplish this, we propose 3 aims,
that will determine: I. Where in the cells APOBEC3 proteins block reverse transcription or deaminate viral
DNA; II. What stage in reverse transcription and where in the cell the host base excision repair enzyme,
UNG, removes uracil from APOBEC3G-deaminated viral DNA and the consequences of this for viral
escape; III. Whether host sensing of viral nucleic acid takes place in the cytoplasm, nucleus or both
compartments. Determination of when and where these events occur is critical to understanding how
retroviruses, including HIV, evade host immunity and the identification of which steps are likely to be the best
targets for interventional therapies at the early stages of infection."
10763865,"Force is transmitted from muscle to tendon across a specialized interface called the myotendinous junction
(MTJ). The MTJ consists of transmembrane, intercellular and extracellular proteins that connect muscle to the
cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) of tendon. The ECM is a 3D network of macromolecules that forms a
continuum integrating muscle and tendon, facilitating the seamless transmission of force. The interdigitating
interface of the MTJ is critical in force transmission from muscle to tendon and is hypothesized to reduce stress;
nevertheless, MTJ injuries can arise from diverse events, including physical work, sports and trauma, which
typically occur due to excessive eccentric force. Challenges in the clinical translation of engineering technologies
targeted toward the muscle-tendon interface arise from the difficulty in integrating two disparate tissues to form
a seamless MTJ. The objective of this proposal is to identify the role of the ECM and mechanical loading in
establishing and maintaining the strong linkage between muscle and tendon. This knowledge will be essential
for developing therapies to restore functionality to damaged MTJs.
 The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that the formation of a mechanically robust MTJ is dependent
on the integration of ECM secreted by both muscle and connective tissue cells at the interface and is maintained
by cyclic loading. We will test our hypothesis in two separate aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the cells and
reciprocal interactions that establish an MTJ-specific ECM. We will use cell-specific metabolic labeling and
proteomics to identify the components that muscle and connective tissue cells independently contribute to the
MTJ (Aim 1a). Since it is currently technically infeasible to target the expression of MTJ-specific proteins only at
the muscle-tendon interface in vivo, we will use in vitro co-cultures to investigate and perturb the reciprocal
signaling between myogenic and connective tissue cells (Aim 1b).
 In Aim 2, we will determine role of mechanical forces in creating and maintaining a functional MTJ. First, we
will directly investigate how embryonic motility affects development by using the muscular dysgenesis mouse
model in which muscle contraction is abrogated (Aim 2a). Then we will directly compare how unloading (hindlimb
suspension) and increased loading (treadmill training) affect the remodeling of ECM at the interface using
metabolic labeling and proteomics. Next, we will generate 3D muscle-tendon constructs based on fibrin gels and
cell-generated ECM (Aim 2b), since is not feasible to completely remove all mechanical forces in vivo. The
constructs will enable us to test the effect of unloading, and static and cyclic loading on MTJ formation.
 Successful completion of the proposed studies will identify the extracellular parameters that establish and
maintain the interface between muscle and tendon, which is essential for developing therapies to restore
functionality to damaged MTJs."

Blunted or flat facial expression is characteristic of schizophrenia (Sz) spectrum disorders and their clinical high
risk (CHR) states, and is associated with negative symptoms, social impairment, and poor outcome. Currently,
there is no objective test to quantify blunted face expression in Sz. However, with advancements in computational
methods, we can begin to operationalize blunted face expression, necessary for both methodological studies
and clinical trials, especially as there are no evidence-based treatments. We propose computational analyses of
time series of video frame-based estimates of movements of individual face muscles, based on Ekman and
Friesen’s Facial Action Coding System or FACS, obtained during ecologically valid open-ended interview on a
remote platform (and during a standard viewing paradigm of valenced stimuli). Face action units (AUs) index
movement of individual face muscles, which have known physiology and circuitry. Our preliminary data are
consistent with early small video coding and electromyography studies of face AUs in Sz, in replicating decreased
mean amplitude of face AUs, especially of AU7 (“lid tightener”) or orbicularis oculi, which is involved in smiling,
but also social signaling more broadly. Further, in generating matrix and distance profiles for face AU time series
data, we find indices of decreased repertoire of face expression in Sz, also associated like amplitudes in CHR
with ratings of blunted affect and poor function. Aim 1 is to assess the correlates and psychometric properties of
these face expression amplitude and repertoire metrics in a large international cohort of early course Sz
spectrum, CHR and healthy individuals well-characterized for demographics, symptoms, cognition and function,
(and in whom effects of medications and chronicity may be less). These metrics are expected to differentiate
psychosis from the norm, have convergent validity with ground truth ratings of “blunted affect”, and be correlated
with social and role impairment, and also face processing ability. Variation by demographics (age, sex, ethnicity)
will be assessed, as well as test-retest reliability at one year. Aim 2 is to align video and audio time series to
create per frame sets of features and envelope metrics in segments in participants to test for differences in facial
dynamics when individuals are speaking vs. listening. We hypothesize that global face expression will decrease
significantly during pauses in individuals with Sz, consistent with preliminary data. Based on a cognitive model,
we hypothesize decreased face expression and pause behavior will be correlated and associated with slowed
processing speed. Aim 3 assesses synchrony of face expression between interviewers and participants, with
patients hypothesized to have decreased synchrony and alignment across modalities. Overall, this large rich
dataset of multimodal time series raw data will be archived and available for analyses, including more complex
nonlinear time series analyses."

The loss of skeletal muscle mass with age is of clinical importance because it is associated with increased
morbidity and mortality, as well as a marked deterioration in the quality of life. There is also a heightened
interest in the identification of cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the lack of an anabolic
response of aged muscle to hypertrophic stimuli. The use of satellite cells to treat loss of skeletal muscle mass
is considered a promising therapeutic strategy given their stem cell characteristics and essential role in post-
natal muscle growth and regeneration. The results of our studies have prompted us to perform mechanistic
analyses of both of the well-known function of satellite cells; fusion to myofibers to provide additional nuclei for
hypertrophic growth, to other functional consequences of satellite cell expansion that occurs in response to
various exogenous stimuli such as exercise, as the increase in satellite cell abundance in response to
mechanical overload far exceeds myonuclear accretion associated with increased myofiber size. We reported
satellite cells were necessary for optimal long-term hypertrophic growth of skeletal muscle by regulating the
extracellular matrix. Activated satellite cells repressed fibroblast collagen production via extracellular vesicle
(EV) delivery of miR-206, revealing a previously unrecognized function of satellite cells, in addition to providing
a mechanism through which satellite cells communicate with other cells within muscle. We now have in vivo
single-cell (sc)RNA-seq evidence from Pax7-tdT reporter mice of a satellite cell intercellular communication
network in which satellite cells communicate with FAPs/fibrogenic cells and endothelial cells during
hypertrophic growth. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that aging negatively impacts this communication network
inhibiting proper remodeling of the extracellular matrix thereby inhibiting hypertrophy. We have also developed
a novel mouse model that allows us to simultaneously deplete satellite cells and label resident myonuclei, Aim
2 will use this model and single-myonuclear (smn)RNA-seq to characterize age-dependent changes in the
resident myonuclear transcriptome and identify mechanisms that enable short term hypertrophy in the absence
of satellite cells in adult mice, which is lost in old age. Aim 3 will use an additional newly developed reporter
mouse that enables specific and stable labeling of satellite cell nuclei to determine how aging alters the
satellite cell-derived myonuclear transcriptome in response to a hypertrophic stimulus. We hypothesize that in
aged muscle, satellite cell-derived myonuclei have altered transcriptional output that does not promote a
hypertrophic response, and that impaired fusion of satellite cells or defective satellite cells may negatively
impact resident myonuclear transcriptional activity contributing to impaired growth. Defining fusion-dependent
and -independent roles of satellite cells and age-associated changes that negatively impact muscle adaptability
will identify potential new targets to promote skeletal muscle growth in the face of inactivity, during aging and in
the face of muscle wasting diseases."

fuels growing concerns about the human health risks imposed by CWD. There are no documented cases of
CWD transmission to humans, even though with the long incubation periods of all prion diseases and the
unknown presentation of CWD in humans definite conclusions are not possible. The zoonotic potential of prion
diseases has been exemplified by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease) which resulted
in a new form of human prion disease (vCJD). BSE was transmissible to Cynomolgus macaques and transgenic
mice expressing the human prion protein. Initial results of CWD transmission studies to the same non-human
primate and mouse models of human prion disease were not successful, corroborating the conclusion that the
zoonotic potential of CWD is low, if not absent. Our groups were part of a consortium that inoculated Cynomolgus
macaques via different routes with CWD. Some animals exhibited subtle clinical signs reminiscent of prion
disease, and upon euthanasia, weak signs of vacuolation, PrPSc deposition and astrocytosis in the brain were
found, while no proteinase K (PK) resistant prion protein (PrP) was detectable. We have now demonstrated for
the first time that CWD from macaques can transmit clinical prion disease to transgenic mouse models of CWD
and human prion disease, albeit in the absence of detectable PK-resistant PrP. Bona fide PrPSc was only
detected upon 3rd passage from mouse to bank vole models. Altogether, this is the first evidence that CWD very
likely has zoonotic potential. The goal of the current proposal is to redefine the zoonotic potential of CWD
by characterizing the biological properties of CWD prions emerging upon experimental transmission
into macaques, for obtaining important information on how CWD could manifest in humans. In Aim 1, we
will study whether CWD from macaque (CWDmac) in bank voles represents a new prion strain, by comparing
biochemical and biological properties to an array of known prion strains from different species. Aim 2 addresses
the question whether CWDmac represents an intermediate prion strain, adaptable to cervids or humans upon
passage, and possessing an expanded host range. We will address this by in vivo passage in cervidized or
humanized mouse models. In vitro, we will utilize serial PMCA and a newly generated PrP0/0 cell culture model
for infection, upon reconstitution with PrP from different species. In Aim 3, we will shed light on the observed
dissociation between infectivity and the presence of bona fide PrPSc. We propose to identify atypical PrP
fragments associated with CWDmac, and we will elucidate brain cell responses to CWDmac exposure by innovative
single cell RNA sequencing. In summary, our studies will uncover the possible manifestation of CWD in humans,
which is of critical importance for drawing definite conclusions about the zoonotic potential of CWD."

TITLE: Post-transcriptional gene regulation
PROJECT SUMMARY:
Much of eukaryotic gene regulation occurs post-transcriptionally, through differential mRNA stability and/or
translational efficiency. The research of this proposal seeks to answer fundamental questions within two
interrelated areas of post-transcriptional gene control: microRNAs and non-coding features of mRNAs.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22-nt RNAs that pair to mRNAs to direct their destabilization and translational
repression. More than 600 miRNA genes have been identified in humans, and because most human genes
are conserved targets of miRNAs, it is no surprise that miRNAs play important roles in mammalian
development and physiology, as well as human diseases, including viral infections and cancers. Molecular,
computational, and structural approaches will be used to determine 1) the biochemical basis of miRNA–target
recognition and improved methods for predicting the most repressed targets, 2) the reasons that some
miRNAs direct the slicing of bound mRNA targets much more readily than others, and 3) the mechanism and
the biological scope of a biochemical pathway that cells use to target specific miRNAs for degradation. Results
of these studies are expected to enhance the fundamental understanding of this important class of gene-
regulatory molecules and provide resources helpful for many biologists, including those studying the roles of
miRNAs in human diseases.
The noncoding features of mRNAs, including excised introns, stably folded mRNA structures, and mRNA
poly(A) tails, can mediate regulatory phenomena. Molecular and computational approaches will be used to
determine 1) the molecular basis of excised-intron stabilization in yeast, 2) the mechanism of G-quadruplex
unfolding in cells, and 3) why longer poly(A) tails enhance translation in metazoan oocytes and early embryos,
and why this relationship between tail length and translation efficiency disappears as the embryo develops.
Results are expected to provide fundamental insight into growth control in yeast and post-translational gene
regulation in metazoan development, with potential implications for human fertility, developmental defects, or
other diseases."

 Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized patients, costly, and strongly associated with mortality.
It is also now widely recognized to be a driver of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). AKI occurs
frequently in common clinical scenarios including sepsis, heart failure, and after coronary artery bypass graft
(CABG) surgery, but it is unclear why some individuals develop AKI in these settings while others do not. We
hypothesize that abnormalities in kidney function that are not captured by creatinine or proteinuria may identify
those predisposed to AKI risk. In preliminary studies in the SPRINT trial, we have shown that abnormalities in
kidney tubule function at baseline predict future development of AKI, independent of creatinine, proteinuria, or
other AKI risk factors. If confirmed, this finding could provide a paradigm shift as it would allow identification of
apparently healthy individuals who are at risk of AKI before the event occurs, enabling strategies to minimize
AKI risk such as alterations in medications, hydration protocols, and surgical approaches. This knowledge
may also give critical new insights into potential pathological mechanisms driving AKI events. By leveraging
the large 30,239 subject Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort, this
application seeks to utilize blood and urine specimens collected when REGARDS participants were clinically
stable outpatients to characterize their kidney tubule health. We will identify REGARDS participants who
subsequently experience sepsis, heart failure, or CABG, and will abstract daily in-patient hospital creatinine
data during these admissions to ascertain AKI presence and severity. We will then determine whether tubule
dysfunction at times of relative health predicts AKI in these clinical scenarios (Aim 1). Next, we will build a
parsimonious biomarker panel that will predict AKI in these settings, setting the stage for future clinical
implementation (Aim 2). Finally, we will re-examine changes in these biomarkers after 10 years of follow-up,
and determine whether tubule injury or dysfunction is differentially altered in survivors of AKI versus controls.
This biomarker signature may allow clinicians to determine whether outpatient (unwitnessed) AKI episodes
may underlie the development or progression of CKD (Aim 3). Our efforts will directly link baseline tubule
function with future AKI risk, setting the stage for innovative therapies to mitigate or prevent AKI."

 Various cell types establish polarity to generate complex morphology and exert function. Schwann cells
(SCs) are polarized with an adaxonal membrane facing the axon and a basolateral membrane facing the
extracellular matrix (ECM). Previous work established that known polarity proteins, Par-3 and LKB-1/Par-4,
localize to the adaxonal membrane prior to myelination and are required within SCs for the timely progression of
myelination and Remak bundle formation. Although SC polarity is critical for proper peripheral nerve
development, the mechanism for establishing polarity within SCs remains unknown. The basal lamina, a
specialized structure of the ECM that abuts the basolateral membrane, is believed to be important for regulating
polarity; additionally, in other epithelial cells collagen-IV is necessary for the establishment of polarity. SCs
secrete collagen-IV into the basal lamina and express integrin alpha2, a collagen-IV receptor also known for its
role in polarity. Therefore, I hypothesize that collagen-IV initiates SC polarity by signaling through integrin alpha2
and is necessary for rSC polarity but dispensable for myelination. I test this possibility by analyzing the role of
SC secreted collagen-IV on peripheral nerve development, determining whether collagen-IV within the SC basal
lamina is necessary and sufficient for SC polarity, and identifying the SC binding partner for collagen-IV.
Preliminary data suggests that SC-secreted collagen-IV is important for timely myelination and Remak bundle
formation. These results phenocopy those observed when polarity is disrupted by knocking out LKB1 specifically
from SCs. Upon completion, this study will have important implications on the integration of extrinsic signals from
the ECM onto the internal cell state. Thereby regulating polarity, which is critical for peripheral nerve health.
Additionally, understanding the results and mechanisms of polarity defects can inform the understanding of
peripheral neuropathies. In order to perform these studies, I will learn various techniques including protein
biochemistry, including Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation, primary cell culture techniques, CRISPR-
based gene editing, mouse behavioral assays, and viral construction/purification/transduction under the
guidance of my sponsor Dr. Jonah Chan. I will receive additional training of career development skills such as
experimental design, presenting posters/presentations, manuscript writing, and manuscript reviewing through
my sponsor, classes within the UCSF Neuroscience Program, and workshops through UCSF Office of Career
and Professional Development. I am confident that the rigorous training I receive during my PhD at UCSF will
enable me to pursue my long-term goal of becoming a tenure track principal investigator within academia."

Pathogenic bacteria must assemble and secrete virulence factors to interact with host tissues and cause disease.
Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane (OM) in addition to a cytoplasmic membrane and must secrete
virulence factors across both these barriers. The mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood.
This project uses the chaperone-usher (CU) pathway as a model system with which to probe mechanisms of
protein secretion and virulence factor biogenesis in Gram-negative bacteria. The CU pathway is a conserved
secretion system dedicated to the assembly of virulence-associated surface structures termed pili or fimbriae.
Pili are hair-like polymers that typically function as adhesive organelles and have roles in colonization of surfaces,
biofilm formation, interactions with host cells, and pathogenesis. The prototype structures assembled by the CU
pathway are the type 1 and P pili expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. E. coli is the primary causative
agent of urinary tract infections, a major healthcare burden and source of antibiotic resistance. Type 1 and P pili
are critical virulence factors that mediate colonization of the bladder and kidneys, respectively. The CU pathway
requires two components for secretion across the OM: a periplasmic chaperone and an integral OM protein
termed the usher. The chaperone directs proper folding of pilus subunit proteins and maintains the proteins in
an assembly-competent state. The usher is a dynamic molecular machine that catalyzes the formation of
subunit-subunit interactions, promotes ordered polymerization of the pilus fiber, and provides the channel for
secretion of the pilus to the cell surface. Pili are critical for initiating and sustaining infection, and the CU pathway
represents an attractive target for the development of anti-virulence therapeutics, particularly for infection of the
urinary tract. The goals of this proposal are to probe the structure and function of the usher to gain a complete
understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing pilus biogenesis at the bacterial OM, and to exploit the
knowledge and expertise gained over the course of this project to develop small molecule inhibitors of the CU
pathway. This proposal will test the hypothesis that the usher distinguishes among and organizes pilus subunits
to guarantee the assembly of adhesive organelles, and that the usher and usher-chaperone-subunit interfaces
are targets for small molecule inhibition. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Determine how the usher
is activated and initiates pilus biogenesis; 2) Define molecular details of the subunit incorporation and pilus
extension cycle; and 3) Identify small molecule inhibitors of usher function in pilus biogenesis. The proposed
studies will answer fundamental questions of protein secretion and the regulated assembly of complex organelles
at the bacterial OM, and will provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic agents that selectively
disrupt virulence factor biogenesis."

Ovarian cancer (OC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death among women and the deadliest
gynecological cancer in the United States. The current standard treatment for ovarian cancer consists of
surgery followed by platinum drug-based chemotherapy. Platinum drugs could induce DNA interstrand
crosslink (ICL), which results in replication fork stalling and thus decrease cell viability. Although most of
patients initially respond to platinun drug-based chemotherapy and achieve remission, up to 80% of patients
become refractory to platinum drugs over time and ultimately succumb to the disease due to the resistance to
platinum-based therapy. Thus, it is urgent to develop novel approaches to overcome platinum drug resistance
of ovarian cancer (PROC). Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is critical to repair ICLs and elevated activity of FA
signaling is one of major mechanisms leading to platinum-resistance in ovarian cancer. The role of FA pathway
in repair of ICL has been well studied last decade, however, how the regulatory switch from a stalled
replication fork caused by platinum drugs to initiation of FA signaling and how FA is activated in PROC cells
are poorly understood.
 To elucidate the mechanism regulating initiation of FA signaling, we have conducted the significant
amount of preliminary studies to demonstrate that And-1 is critical for activation of FA signaling and FA-
mediated platinum drug resistance in ovarian cancer. The major objective of this proposal is to determine the
mechanism of how And-1-FANCM axis regulates FA signaling and platinum resistance in PROC. Here, we
propose three specific aims. Aim 1: Determine how And-1 promotes the switch from stalled replication forks to
initiation of FA signaling at ICLs. Aim 2: Determine the role of And-1 in the regulation of platinum drug
resistance in PROC cells. Aim 3: Evaluate the effects of And-1 inhibition on platinum drug resistance using
orthotopic PROC PDX and syngeneic models. The completion of proposed studies will not only elucidate a
novel mechanism regulating platinum resistance in PROC, but also provide an innovative therapeutic strategy
as well as a new potential drug for treatment of PROC patients."
10823230,"SUMMARY: The stability of neural connections (synapses) and long-term survival of neurons are critically
important to human health, as many neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including dementia, result
in the loss of vital synaptic connections in the brain. These dementia disorders currently affect 28 million people
worldwide, a number that will increase precipitously as our population continues to age. The proposed research
will explore how synapses are maintained when faced with exposure to extreme environmental stressors with
the aim of identifying translatable molecular targets to prevent synaptic loss during the normal aging process
and the diseased state. To evaluate synaptic stability in the extremes, we will use an invertebrate species, the
tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris, which has the ability to survive near-complete desiccation, and which I
recently found can survive extreme hyper-gravity equivalent to 500,000 times the earth’s gravity for an hour.
Mechanisms by which the animal survives desiccation are relatively well understood, in that the animal forms
a ‘tun,’ an inanimate state of metabolic suspension which is accompanied by gross morphological changes
and the loss of nearly 99% of their water content. In contrast, the mechanisms by which these animals survive
the extreme forces exerted by hyper-gravity remain wholly unexplored. Following reanimation from desiccation
or return to normal gravity, animals rapidly restore coordinated walking and head motions suggesting that their
nervous system remains grossly unperturbed by these phenomenal feats of extremotolerance. A critical
question is how the nervous system and synaptic function remain stable under these extraordinary
environmentally induced stresses. The proposed research will unveil the underpinnings of tardigrade nervous
system survival by testing the hypothesis that tardigrades fortify their nervous system through the stabilization
of synapses under extreme environmental insults. We will first explore anatomical changes to synapse density
and morphology during desiccation and hyper-gravity by direct visualization of synapses and neurons in the
nervous system (Aim 1). We will assess the functional maintenance of synapses throughout desiccation and
hyper-gravity via a memory-retention paradigm (Aim 2). Finally, we will identify novel targets by monitoring the
dynamic changes in the “proteome” that are triggered by extreme hyper-gravity and desiccation, analyze the
functional roles of synaptic proteins via the removal of key synaptic regulatory proteins and ultimately apply
our identified target molecules to analysis of an in vitro mouse model of neurodegeneration (Aim 3)."

ABSTRACT
Stewart Cole and colleagues determined the complete genome sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
in 1998 (1). This landmark achievement heralded a new age in mycobacterial research, including the
development of organism-wide gene knockout and knockdown technologies that made it possible to determine
the roles of specific mycobacterial genes in survival and host response. However, despite the ability to
interrogate thousands of new potential targets, few new genes have advanced as targets for active clinical
drug development. This shortfall stems, in part, from key technical limitations in the ability to systematically
interrogate the Mtb genome on an organism-wide basis. To help overcome this limitation, Jeremy Rock and
colleagues developed CRISPRi interference (CRISPRi) technologies that achieve robust, programmable gene
silencing in Mtb. The Rock laboratory has now validated a genome-scale library of 96,700 independent
CRISPRi mutants, which comprise the central technology of the Bacterial Genetics Core D. These efforts have
resulted refined CRISPRi design rules, allowing the generation of highly efficacious and specific CRISPRi
knockdown for nearly all Mtb genes, including methods for titratable knockdown of essential genes. The
Bacterial Genetics Core will support Project 1 by designing and constructing individual and pools of Mtb
CRISPRi mutants to identify new lipids that are downstream of genes involved in virulence, barrier function and
Mtb strain variations in human patients. Core D will support Project 2 by providing genetic mutants within the
MtrAB signal transduction pathway, a central mediator of intrinsic multi-drug resistance in Mtb. In addition,
CRISPRi will be used to silence genes involved in the mycobacterial drug response, intrinsic drug resistance to
rifampicin, as well as Mtb envelope composition. These studies will identify novel genetic and biochemical
targets for development of new anti-mycobacterial drugs. Further, these experiments inform strategies for
augmenting the efficacy of existing drugs through targeting bacterial genes that modulate the sensitivity of Mtb
to antibiotics."
10808986,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-
related death. This is attributable to the asymptomatic early stages of disease, the
fibrotic nature of the tumor, and the lack of response to surgery, chemo- and
immunotherapies. The lack of response to immunotherapy is despite the fact that
pancreatic cancer exhibits a significant immune infiltrate. Relatively little is
understood about the immune landscape in PDAC, but it is clear that suppressive
populations of macrophages likely play a key role in shaping the tumor
microenvironment and targeting them could impact responses to therapy. Likewise,
altered microbiome activity has been linked to pancreatic cancer progression,
resistance to immune therapy, and survival times in patients. Recently we
described a critical role for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as a driver of
macrophage suppressive function. Since AhR is an important sensor of microbial
metabolites, we surmised that the microbiome may drive tumor macrophage
function via the metabolic products produced by the flora; while blocking AhR
activity would cause the tumor microenvironment to become “hot” enhancing
responses to standard-of-care chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The goal of this
proposal is to investigate how the microbiome alters immunity in the tumor
microenvironment. To achieve this goal, we have developed an orthotopic mouse
model of PDAC. Our preliminary data demonstrate that AhR is critical for tumor
growth and specific metabolites produced by Lactobacillus species drive
macrophage suppressive function and suppress T cell inflammatory maturation. In
the current proposal, we will mechanistically investigate how the modulation of
macrophage function by AhR occurs in the tumor microenvironment. We will then
examine the prediction that blocking AhR will improve tumor responses to
gemcitabine and checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and finally we will test predictions
generated in the mouse models in human macrophages and examine the
correlation between the microbiome, AhR activity, and survival in PDAC patients.
The experiments outlined in this proposal will establish important biologic principles
and provide a new mechanistic link between microbiome:tumor interactions that
fosters growth and metastasis. Ultimately, the mechanisms and paradigms we
reveal have the potential to lead to new strategies to treat PDAC and significantly
impact clinical outcomes for this terrible disease."

Abstract
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the third most common form of cardiovascular disease after myocardial
infarction and ischemic stroke, with approximately 900,000 cases annually in the United States. VTE may present
clinically as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE). However, it is unknown why some
patients present with symptomatic DVT, while others present with PE. In recent years, it has been established
that individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), as well as carriers for SCD -- who are said to have sickle cell trait
-- are at increased risk of VTE. Interestingly and unusually, in both sickle cell disease and trait, a skewed
distribution in the proportions of patients with DVT and PE (in favor of PE) is observed. We have termed this
phenomenon “the sickle cell paradox”. SCD is due to an inherited mutation in hemoglobin that is expressed
exclusively in red blood cells (RBCs). Therefore, in this proposal, we postulate that a greater understanding of
the mechanism of VTE in SCD, as well as an explanation for the sickle cell paradox, will be explained by a
detailed study of the role of sickle RBCs in VTE. To address this question, we will utilize animal models of SCD
with experimentally induced venous thrombi, while concurrently studying the qualitative aspects of blood clots
formed from the blood of patients with SCD ex vivo. Towards this goal, we will address the following specific
aims: in Aim 1, we will determine the effect of RBCs on venous thromboembolism in a mouse model of SCD.
We expect that partial RBC exchange will result in smaller, more stable DVTs and a reduced incidence of PE. In
Aim 2, we will investigate how sickle RBCs enhance thrombin generation in SCD. In the third Aim, we will
determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms that attenuate sensitivity of sickle clots to fibrinolysis. We
anticipate this effect is mediated both by the inherited defect in SCD RBCs, but also the fact that platelets in
patients with SCD are over-activated. Finally, in Aim 4, we will determine whether reduction of platelet numbers
reduces VTE and restores normal susceptibility to fibrinolysis in sickle mice and SCD patients undergoing chronic
RBC exchange. With an annual worldwide SCD birth rate of more than 300,000 (and an estimated 250 million
individuals with sickle trait), a greater mechanistic understanding of VTE in sickle cell disorders is a high priority.

Although multiple pathways and targets have been proposed for OA treatment, the rate of drug failure in clinical
trials has been astoundingly high. The reasons for the limited success include the late detection of the disease
and a lack of understanding of the molecular heterogeneity between patients. In this proposal, we aim to
capitalize on the newly developed single-cell proteomic technique, mass cytometry (CyTOF) that allows
detection of 40-80 proteins simultaneously in single cells, with the aim of identifying the diverse cellular
subpopulations in OA cartilage. Although cartilage is a relatively simple tissue, with a single cell type being
encapsulated in its secreted extracellular matrix (ECM), the variable degree of degeneration associated with
each OA patient suggests that understanding this tissue (and other joint tissues) at a single cell level can provide
novel insights into both OA pathology and patient heterogeneity. This will compliment single-cell transcriptomic
data, with the additional advantage that the proteomic snapshot can also identify active signaling pathways in
the identified subpopulations. The single-cell proteomic approach is especially pertinent in robustly identifying
rare cell populations that are difficult to discern from RNA-sequencing data. In this proposal, we will establish
single cell profiles of a large cohort of OA cartilage samples using a refined panel of rare earth metal labeled
antibodies in Aim1 to identify distinct subpopulations in OA cartilage. In aim 2, we will test if the modulation of
two newly identified rare subpopulations would be therapeutic in a mouse model of post-traumatic OA as well as
follow their dynamics with disease progression. In Aim 3, we will analyze how drug treatments affect the cartilage
subpopulations and their crosstalk in different patients especially to discern between a uniform or heterogenous
response among the patient cohort. Collectively, the proposed studies will be impactful in identifying novel
regenerative and pathological cell populations in OA and testing the therapeutic potential of their modulation."

COVID-19, the multiorgan disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has become the most
impactful healthcare, social, and economic crisis of our lifetime. SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to the
previous two coronaviruses that caused human outbreaks in the 21st century, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Even
though COVID-19 mortality is lower than the other two coronavirus diseases, the pandemic has impacted, by
mid-April 2022, >500 million people worldwide, and caused >6 million deaths. Had the COVID-19 mortality been
closer to those of SARS and MERS, the impact of the current pandemic would be incomparably more
catastrophic. The need for cold storage, the requirement for boosters, and the potential for adverse allergic
reactions, are major drawbacks of current COVID-19 vaccines.
To address these shortcomings, we propose to generate a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine that is stable at room
temperature, requires only one injection, thus being more practical to deploy nationally and globally during
vaccination campaigns, and is less prone to cause hypersensitivity reactions. We plan to conduct this Proof-of-
Concept study over a 24-month period with a multidisciplinary team of engineers, molecular virologists, and
immunologists. Our overarching goal is to double nanoencapsulate the mRNA molecule that encodes the
coronavirus Spike protein in phospholipid nanosomes and then into biodegradable polymer nanospheres to
sustain mRNA release. We will characterize the antigenicity and integrity of the nanoencapsulated mRNA before
and after nanoencapsulation and coating and determine the best process conditions that ensure stability at room
temperature after lyophilization. We will also evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of the
nanoencapsulated antigen and perform challenge studies in two animal models, in anticipation of subsequent
clinical studies. Based on these studies, we will select the best nanoformulation for scale-up, more detailed
characterization, establish potency and release specifications, and regulatory studies in Phase II."
10812450,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Both inputs to the brain and outputs from the brain occur over a broad range of timescales and
in many cases repeat rhythmically. Rhythmic changes in gene expression have been studied
in the brain only in the context of circadian rhythms. Additionally, shorter-than-a-day (ultradian)
rhythms have been sparsely reported and it is unknown how these rhythms originate,
particularly at the molecular level and whether they interact and/or share part of the
timekeeping machinery utilized by the circadian clock. Understanding how these rhythms are
generated and maintained will illuminate new aspects of brain gene expression and physiology
and open unexplored areas of research.
In an effort to reveal RNA oscillations at different timescales in the fly brain, we profiled fly brains
by RNAseq every two hours for three days. By analyzing these data, we identified dozens of
RNAs oscillating with 6-, 12-, and 24-hour rhythms in the brain. Interestingly, enrichment
analysis shows that more than half of these genes are highly expressed in the glia, suggesting
this cell type has oscillators operating at different timescales. The importance and novelty
of these results are two-fold: a. they demonstrate, for the first time, the presence of ultradian
RNA oscillations in the fly brain; b. suggest the existence of oscillators operating at
different timescales (circadian and ultradian) in the glial cells. In this context, the present
proposal aims to comprehensively identify the mechanisms responsible for ultradian
rhythmic gene expression in the glial cells within the fly brain. Our work will shed light on
new mechanisms of ultradian expression in flies for the first time. In addition, we will identify
and characterize new timekeeping or timer-like mechanisms operating in glial cells that also
have a circadian clock. Last, our work will provide new information and lead to developing tools
to perturb and investigate these rhythms in the future.
In sum, we are convinced that this project will uncover new modes of timed regulation of
transcription and physiology within the brain, which might be of vast importance beyond
Drosophila and uncover potential connections between ultradian and circadian oscillators
within these cells. This pioneering study will set the stage for further studying the role of
oscillations in the glia, a key cell type in the brain, as well as to understand the mechanism and
role of ultradian rhythms in general. As circadian rhythms have been linked to numerous diseases
including depression and sleep disorders, the present proposal has obvious implications for
human health."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by social impairments and restricted and repetitive
behaviors. Those with a genetic liability for social deficits, including individuals with ASD and their unaffected
relatives are also at high risk for internalizing and externalizing conditions. The presence of comorbid affective
and behavioral conditions impairs adaptive functioning, increases family stress, and is associated with
psychiatric hospitalizations and residential placement. Identification of risk factors for internalizing and
externalizing disorders amongst young children with ASD and their siblings would improve diagnostic practices
and promote implementation of preventative and early interventions. Extensive research in the general
population indicates that precursors of internalizing and externalizing disorders can be identified in the first two
years of life as indexed by elevated or attenuated levels of Emotional Reactivity (eReactivity), or intensity of
emotional reactions in response to internal or external triggers. Extant, albeit limited, evidence suggests that
toddlers with ASD and their unaffected siblings exhibit atypical eReactivity profiles both on the behavioral and
physiological levels, though the evidence is incomplete and both their origins and the links with later
psychopathology are largely unknown. To fill this gap, we propose to prospectively examine the development
of eReactivity from 4 to 30 months in 150 younger siblings of children with ASD, who, due to familial factors,
are at high risk for developing ASD (HR) and 30 low-risk (LR) siblings. We plan to examine eReactivity to real-
world triggers aimed to elicit fear, anger, and joy, and to evaluate the effects of the social and nonsocial nature
of the triggers on eReactivity across the three emotions using a state-of-the-art multi-method behavioral and
physiological approach. Aim 1 will evaluate prospectively whether the HRASD group (siblings with ASD), HRATP
(siblings with developmental challenges), and HRTD (siblings without developmental challenges) are
characterized by distinct patterns of eReactivity to social vs nonsocial triggers as measured by behavioral and
physiological indices between 4 and 30 months compared to the LRTD group. The aim will clarify if differential
emotional reactivity to social and nonsocial triggers constitutes an emerging characteristic of the autism
phenotype in ASD. Aim 2 will examine predictive relationships between development of eReactivity in infancy
and severity of internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 30 months. Identification of early predictors of
internalizing/externalizing problems will facilitate access to early interventions aimed at amelioration of
behavioral and emotional challenges. Consistent with the Research Domain Criteria research framework
recommendations, the project (1) employs multiple levels of analysis, (2) investigates negative and positive
valence systems as well as arousal systems, and (3) examines a spectrum of ASD risk with long-term goals of
improving diagnostic precision in ASD and enabling discovery of novel treatment targets and interventions both
during prodromal and early syndromal stages of the disorder."

Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this
cognitive flexibility is our ability to respond correctly to novel contextual situations on the first attempt, without
prior rehearsal. We refer to this ability as ‘ad hoc self-programming’: ‘ad hoc’ because these new behavioral
repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer
necessary; ‘self-programming’ because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands
and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. The overall goal of our research effort is to
understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.
 Our previous U01 project (NS 108923) focused on how these programs of action are initially created. Our
results thus far have revealed tantalizing notions of how the brain represents these programs and navigates
through them. In this proposal, therefore, we focus on the question of how these mental programs are
executed. Based on our preliminary findings and critical conceptual work, we propose that the medial temporal
lobe (MTL) and ventral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) creates representations of the critical elements of these mental
programs, including concepts such as ‘rules’ and ‘locations’, to allow for effective navigation through the
algorithm.
 These data suggest the existence of an ‘algorithmic state space’ represented in medial temporal and
prefrontal regions. This proposal aims to understand the neurophysiological underpinnings of this algorithmic
state space in humans. By studying humans, we will profit from our species’ powerful capacity for generalization
to understand how such state spaces are constructed. We therefore leverage the unique opportunities available
in human neuroscience research to record from single cells and population-level signals, as well as to use
intracranial stimulation for causal testing, to address this challenging problem.
 In Aim 1 we study the basic representations of algorithmic state space using a novel behavioral task that
requires the immediate formation of unique plans of action. Aim 2 directly compares representations of
algorithmic state space to that of physical space by juxtaposing balanced versions of spatial and algorithmic
tasks in a virtual reality (VR) environment. Finally, in Aim 3, we test hypotheses regarding interactions between
vPFC and MTL using intracranial stimulation."

Globally, there are more deaths from cancer than from HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. In 2018, there
were more than 18 million new cancer cases and 9.5 million cancer deaths worldwide, and, by 2030, these
numbers will increase by at least 50%. Countries with low or medium Human Development Index account for
more than 60% of cancer cases and 70% of cancer deaths. Cancer deaths in sub-Saharan Africa occur
disproportionately from cancers that are preventable and/or curable including lymphoma, cervical cancer and
breast cancer. Addressing the substantial burden of cancer requires a new generation of cancer
researchers who can test hypotheses in the African context. The University of North Carolina Project-
Malawi (UNCPM) has a rich cancer research environment that includes participation in the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) U54 consortium for HIV associated malignancies, the AIDS Malignancy Consortium, the
International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA), NCI African Esophageal Cancer
Consortium, and a USAID-funded cervical cancer screening study. To date, UNCPM has had significant
success in cancer clinical trials and translational research projects, and in establishing a handful of early-
career investigators, but momentum is needed to build on this foundation. First, large improvements in cancer
control in Malawi require approaches that extend beyond clinical trials to cancer outcomes research, a broader
approach that requires unique skills. At this time, there are few cancer researchers with both the necessary
cancer research skills and the local experience to develop cancer outcomes solutions adapted to the Malawian
context. Second, there is no defined pipeline for early-career cancer research capacity. Finally, there are few
opportunities for successful Malawian investigators to obtain the additional skills and experience necessary to
be competitive for independent research funding. To address these gaps, we propose to establish the Malawi
Cancer Outcomes Research Program (M-CORP). This application is led by UNC in conjunction with the
University of Malawi College of Medicine (COM) and in collaboration with other national and international
institutions and training programs. M-CORP aims to increase the cadre of trained investigators who can pursue
independent research careers by: 1) establishing a robust curriculum and training opportunities across the
continuum of cancer outcomes research specific to the Malawian environment and research priorities; 2)
supporting advanced degrees; and 3) overcoming obstacles to research independence by providing post-
doctoral opportunities including mentored pilot grants. We will use a multi-PD leadership strategy based at both
UNC and UNCPM that will optimize our strengths across the spectrum of cancer outcomes research. An
exceptional pool of multidisciplinary mentors, a detailed plan for program evaluation, and robust, broad-based
partnerships between UNC and Malawian institutions ensure that M-CORP objectives will be met and will
establish Malawi as an internationally recognized center of excellence for cancer outcomes research."

Since the start of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it has been recognized that drug abuse is strongly linked to contracting
and transmitting HIV, as well as more severe consequences. Factors influencing the susceptibility and disease
progression are still unclear. Viral reservoir establishment occurs early in acute HIV infection and reaches a set
point within the first two months of infection, which in turn determines the size of the reservoir in the chronic
stage. HIV enters the brain right after infection and replicates in macrophages, microglia, and to a small extent
in astrocytes. Increased susceptibility in substance use could affect the size of the central nervous system (CNS)
reservoir, which may influence spontaneous virological remission and viral rebound kinetics. CNS viral reservoir
size may also determine the HIV- associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) severity, viral recurrence, and
rebound. Until now, there was no means to study the viral dynamics, CNS viral invasion, susceptibility to MP
infection in the brain, and the reservoirs of HIV infection so that interventions can be developed effectively. A
small animal model, like the humanized mouse, provides great advantages due to manipulations using
host/human cells, as well as the possibility of establishing chronic infection by HIV itself. The humanized
microglial (hMGL) mouse model is reconstituted with the human immune system and human glial cells, which
allows natural progression of CNS infection and disease in relation to peripheral HIV infection. Herein, we
propose to deploy our hMGL mouse to elucidate the mechanisms of HIV-1 invasion, persistence, and
neuropathogenesis for substance use. Our objective is to define the CNS viral reservoir and investigate changes
in the brain viral reservoir as a consequence of substances of abuse with an overarching goal of viral eradication.
Our aims are, 1. to investigate the effect of cocaine on the CNS viral invasion, reservoir establishment, and viral
latency during chronic infection in humanized microglial mice, 2. to determine the host genetic signatures that
accelerate the CNS viral reservoir and assess the influence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on glial homeostasis,
and 3. to study HIV and SUD-induced neuropathology using a multimodal approach. The complete
characterization of this humanized mouse model in establishing linkages to human disease, and demonstrating
a comprehensive evaluation of the CNS reservoir during cART, HIV infection, and drug abuse will prove to be a
significant value to the neuroHIV field."
10841572,"Project Summary/Abstract
Rapid and specific histopathologic diagnoses are critical for cancer treatment. Tumor tissue biopsy is routinely
performed to detect and monitor cancer progression. Current test biopsies require surgically-collected tissue
samples from detectable primary or metastatic tumors. Several difficulties, such as patient inconvenience,
multistep complicated procedure, partial samplings, and non-specific findings, make this process slow,
invasive, expensive, unfit for screening large sample sizes, and error-prone. Non-invasive selections of
biomarkers in body fluids, known as liquid biopsy, offer great promise in complementing or even substituting
surgical tissue biopsy in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer patients. Recent studies have indicated
exosomal microRNAs (exmiRs) as promising liquid biopsy biomarkers in detecting cancer progression and
efficacy of therapy with high sensitivity and specificity. However, current technologies for ex-miR detection,
such as qRT-PCR, and microarray screening tests, require high sample volume, are expensive, slow, tedious,
requiring highly specialized skills and resources such as ultracentrifuge, expensive RNA extraction kits, etc.
Single-exosome level studies can significantly circumvent these problems. However, the few single-molecule
ex-miR quantification attempts lack amplification strategy, thus limiting their applications to resource-heavy
research settings. To address these problems, we have developed a molecular beacon-based
Transmembrane Nano-Sensor (TraNS) that inserts itself into the membrane of lipid vesicles and signals the
presence of a DNA target by an increase in fluorescence. We have successfully demonstrated the ability of the
TraNS device to spontaneously insert into the lipid membrane and sense membrane-enclosed nucleic acid
biomarkers with high specificity. In this study, we propose to (1) optimize the TraNS device to sense cancer-
specific ex-miRs from biofluids, (2) harness the transmembrane structural reconfiguration of TraNS to develop
an isothermal signal amplification method to improve the sensitivity of detection significantly, and (3) integrate
the TraNS device with our patented DNA origami-based biomarker detection array to improve the throughput,
specificity, and sensitivity of digital quantification of ex-miR stoichiometry with low sample volume. We will use
the platform’s sensitivity, specificity, and throughput on clinical samples from pancreatic cancer patients
against their healthy controls. This effort’s potential impact can help physicians and clinicians with rapid,
ultrasensitive, precise, and cost-effective cancer diagnostics without a surgical tissue biopsy."
10843319,"ABSTRACT
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are bilayer membrane structures of diameters 30 – 1000 nm released into the blood
by cells throughout the body, at concentrations on the order of 1010 per ml. Their molecular content of proteins,
dsDNA oligomers, microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNAs, and other analytes, may play multiple functional roles via EV
trafficking, and may also provide a diagnostic report back on the disease site or tissue of origin. As such, EVs
can serve as potential sources of cancer biomarkers, perhaps even providing insights into the genetic and
functional characteristics of the tumor microenvironment. However, this potential remains largely untapped due
to technical challenges.
We propose to develop an ultra-high-throughput droplet-based multiomic profiling platform, Vesicle Epitope
Transcript sequencing (VET-seq), that can simultaneously resolve the surface proteome, internal proteins,
and broad RNA spectrum with single extracellular vesicle (sEV) resolution. In AIM 1, we manipulate EVs to
permit access to encapsulated EV cargoes and allow in situ modifications of EV molecules. This will yield
protocols for detecting a broad spectrum of EV molecules. Here, we also begin to generate and validate custom
probes for VET-seq. In AIM 2, we propose an EV indexing approach to add vesicle-specific barcodes to EV
molecules that enable the identification of their vesicle-source. This strategy will significantly increase the
throughput for droplet-based EV profiling by overcoming the need for limiting dilution. To address the unmet
need for a cost-effective multiomic sEV profiling method, in AIM 3, we integrate the in situ modification protocols
and the EV indexing protocol to form the VET-seq workflow. We will benchmark the VET-seq protocol on EVs
isolated from human cancer cell lines and drug resistance models. The EV detection limit of VET-seq will be
determined for cancer-cell derived EVs in a background of EVs isolated from human plasma and serum. High-
dimensional sEV profiling enabled by VET-seq will deepen our understanding of the molecular contents and
biological implications of EVs in the context of cancer. This will potentially shed light into the utility of EVs as
cancer biomarkers for early detection of cancer or recurrent cancer as well as for monitoring treatment response
to cancer therapeutics.
Our multidisciplinary team is comprised of scientists and clinicians with expertise in micro-nanotechnologies,
multiomics analysis, EV biology, computational biology, clinical oncology, and assay development."

Surgical resection is curative in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Unfortunately, surgical cases often suffer
from early recurrence (up to 50% in two years), which leads to dismal outcomes. Currently, there are no
approved neoadjuvant therapy options to induce pathologic response and reduce the rate of recurrence.
Notably, suppression of host immunity in HCC is a hallmark of cancer establishment and progression.
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) is an immune checkpoint receptor present on T-cells that binds to
specific ligands (PD-L1, PD-L2) on both tumor stroma and cancer cells. In preliminary studies, we have
analyzed resected HCC tissues after preoperative immunotherapy in early HCC. We found specific clusters
correlating with promising responses, including frequent pathologic complete responses at the time of
surgery (Cancer Immunol Res 2019). In addition, we demonstrated that PD-1 blockade can stabilize tumor
vasculature, thus enhancing anti-tumor immunity when combined with VEGF pathway blockade in
preclinical models of HCC (Hepatology 2020). Our goal is to show that reprogramming of immune
microenvironment in HCC will result in greater benefit for immunotherapy. We hypothesize that: 1)
Neoadjuvant anti-PD-L1/VEGF therapy is feasible, active and will induce pathologic complete response in resectable
HCCs, and 2) HCCs responding to neoadjuvant anti-PD-L1/VEGF therapy will have increased intratumoral CD8+
T-cell : Treg ratio, circulating cytokine levels, and favorable metabolic changes on imaging. We will test these
hypotheses in 2 specific aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-L1/VEGF combination therapy
in neoadjuvant setting in resectable HCC patients. This randomized, multi-site phase II clinical study will
accrue 90 patients based on 2:1 randomization (neoadjuvant atezo/bev = 60, versus upfront surgery = 30)
and has 2 sub-aims: Aim 1a will evaluate safety and pathologic response rate as the primary endpoints in
the atezo/bev arm; Aim 1b will evaluate 3-year recurrence-free survival rate and OS as secondary endpoints
in the atezo/bev arm versus control. Aim 2: To determine if activation of anti-tumor immunity correlates with
durable responses after dual anti-PD-L1/VEGF therapy in neoadjuvant setting in resectable HCC patients, which has
3 sub-aims through studying tissue, peripheral blood, and imaging parameters. Aim 2a is to analyze immune T-
cell clusters in pretreatment biopsies and posttreatment surgical resection specimens to evaluate CD8+ T-
cell : Treg ratio using multiplexed immunofluorescence and single cell RNA sequencing. Aim 2b is to study
changes in tissue immune cells, regulatory proteins, and plasma cytokines (multiplexed protein array) to
explore a biomarker signature that may predict response. Aim 2c is to evaluate correlation between
response and changes in tumor metabolic activity using PET MRI scan pre- and posttreatment. The impact
of this project is that it may transform the role of immunotherapy in HCC from palliative to curative."
10793644,"Delirium is a serious cognitive disorder associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)
that affects ~2.6 million older adults yearly. It is a frequent complication of acute illness, surgery and, now, of
COVID-19 infection in older adults. Recognizing the relative dearth of delirium research, the National Institute
for Aging (NIA) supported the establishment of the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists
(NIDUS), a collaborative interdisciplinary group of 28 investigators, from 27 institutions, to advance delirium
research and develop network infrastructure. This included the creation of an annual “NIDUS bootcamp”
conference, to bring together the growing national- and international delirium research community for
networking and education. The bootcamp aims are to advance the science of the field and to provide junior
investigators with intensive mentorship, through mock NIH application reviews, clinical and research lectures,
breakout sessions, and post-bootcamp networking. Bootcamp alumni are provided guidance on: 1) using the
NIDUS Delirium Research Hub, Measurement resources and Bibliography, 2) submitting proposals to the
NIDUS Pilot Program (13 one-year $50,000 grants awarded), NIA GEMSSTAR/CLINSTAR, the Alzheimer’s
Association, and other foundations, 3) attending Mentoring webinars, 4) participating in Junior Faculty Working
Groups, and 5) submitting research abstracts to the American Delirium Society (ADS) Annual Meeting. As PIs,
94 alumni have received 46 grants, of which 18 (40%) were NIH-funded, and published 265 original peer-
reviewed articles. NIDUS has jumpstarted the careers of many young investigators, particularly bootcamp
alumni, enabling them to launch independent programs in delirium research.
The goal of this application is to support continuation of a yearly, themed Delirium Bootcamp Conference
(DBC), to ensure that the progress of this active research community is sustained. The first-year theme will be
the inter-relationship between delirium and ADRD. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Engage and support junior
investigators in delirium research through mentorship and access to the NIDUS resources/network (2) Boost
the researchers’ funding success (3) Facilitate publication of delirium research and provide ongoing
mentorship, and (4) Facilitate networking among junior, mid-career, and senior researchers during and after
DBC. As the pool of delirium investigators expands, there is a critical need for a conference focused on
addressing cutting-edge research methods in all areas of delirium research, including the relationship with
ADRD, “-Omics” research, machine learning and big data, innovations in randomized trials, animal models and
mechanistic research, and clinical practice improvement. The DBC will provide an unparalleled opportunity to
advance cutting-edge delirium research through interactive didactic sessions and in-depth guidance on
complex and nuanced research methods essential for the highest caliber and most impactful delirium research."
10817793,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the relative success of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) against pneumococcal otitis media
(OM), the incidence of all-cause OM remains unacceptably high worldwide and broad use of PCVs has also
changed the microbiology of OM to one in which nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) predominates.
Additionally, whereas the importance of biofilms in OM pathogenesis, chronicity and recurrence is recognized,
and the recalcitrance of biofilms to antimicrobials is well accepted, we nonetheless still treat OM with oral
antibiotics that do not reach levels in the middle ear required to kill planktonic bacteria, let alone those resident
in a biofilm. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is also not without consequence. Rashes and diarrhea are
common, and we now know that early life use of antibiotics disrupts development of the very gut microbiome
that is essential for normal human immune system development. Due to global concerns about these issues, in
a recent Nature commentary, thought leaders encouraged us to consider new ways to combine the protection
offered by effective induced antibodies with the more appropriate use of antibiotics as our “last hope against
multi-drug resistant bacteria and persistent disease”(55). With the recent recognition that bacteria which cause
persistent diseases exist in not only planktonic or biofilm-resident states, but also a third distinct newly
released (NRel) state that is the most sensitive to killing by antibiotics, we envision use of specifically targeted
antibodies to release bacteria from their highly resistant biofilms so they can now be killed by both host
immune effectors and, if necessary, traditional antibiotics but now used at a markedly reduced dose and for a
limited time. We demonstrate via many new preliminary data that NRel NTHI are highly unique and further, that
NRel NTHI populations are distinct from each other, dependent upon the specific effector that induced their
release. Here, we strive to combine our expertise in immunology with both our advanced understanding of
biofilm structural biology and our growing appreciation of the NRel NTHI state. Integration of these concepts
provides us with the opportunity to develop a truly novel approach that we believe could offer a viable option
with which to combat chronic and recurrent OM. We will utilize our understanding of both the NRel phenotype
and the activity of specifically directed antibodies to leverage their combined power. In Aim 1, we will use
established in vitro assays to determine how environmental conditions (singly and in combination) affect the
kinetics, extent of duration and phenotype of NRel bacteria as a target for intervention to identify the control
points and rate-limiting steps that confer greatest vulnerability. In Aim 2, we will further define the significant
vulnerability of the NRel state in OM through changes in release kinetics, gene expression and clearance of
otopathogenic biofilms by innate immune effectors. In Aim 3, we will conduct preclinical testing of specifically
targeted antibodies capable of inducing the NRel state to resolve experimental OM due to NTHI, the
predominant pathogen of acute OM, recurrent OM, chronic OM, CSOM and OM that fails treatment."

 Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with high rates of disability, as well as suicidal ideation and
behavior. Current treatments for MDD have significant limitations in efficacy and side effect burden, while FDA-
approved devices for MDD are burdensome and only suitable for severely ill subjects. There is a critical need
for device-based treatments in MDD that are efficacious, well-tolerated and easy to use. Transcranial
photobiomodulation (t-PBM) with near-infrared (NIR) light penetrates robustly into the cerebral cortex and
 This project focuses on the adjunctive use of the transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) with near-
infrared (NIR) light for the treatment of MDD. t-PBM with near-infrared (NIR) light penetrates robustly into the
cerebral cortex, stimulating the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and also significantly increases cerebral blood
flow (CBF). In the R61 phase, we will conduct target engagement studies to demonstrate dose-dependent
effects of t-PBM on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) CBF, using the increase in fMRI blood-oxygenation-level
dependent (BOLD) signal levels as our Go/No-go target engagement biomarker. In the R33 phase, we will
conduct a randomized clinical trial of t-PBM vs. sham for in MDD, to establish the target engagement and
evaluate the association between changes in the biomarker (BOLD signal) and changes in clinical symptoms,
while also collecting important information on antidepressant effects, safety and tolerability. The study will be
done in parallel at the New York University/ Nathan Kline Institute and at Massachusetts General Hospital.
 The importance of this study is threefold: (1) it targets MDD, a leading cause of disability wordwide, which
lacks adequate treatments, (2) it evaluates t-PBM, which has a well-established safety profile and has the
potential to be safe in at-home administration, and (3) uses fMRI BOLD changes as a target engagement
biomarker. If effects are confirmed, the present study will both support short-term clinical development of an
easy to scale device for the treatment of MDD, while also validating a biomarker for the development of future,
novel modulation strategies."

High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is a devastating disease responsible for the deaths of ~125,000
women worldwide each year. HGSOC has the lowest survival rates. More than 20% of HGSOCs harbor genetic
mutations (e.g. BRCA1/2MUT) that cause defects in homologous recombination (HR), which causes sensitivity
to PARPi. However, responses to PARPi are rarely durable and resistance is acquired rapidly. Another 50% of
HGSOCs do not harbor defects in HR and instead overexpress Cyclin E (CCNE1) through amplification, copy
number gain, or transcriptional means. Unlike BRCA1/BRCA2-mutant tumors, which initially respond to platinum-
based chemotherapy, CCNE1-amplified tumors are associated with primary platinum failure. A recent study
revealed that 1) Cyclin E (CCNE1) induction increases ATR signaling and sensitivity to WEE1 kinase inhibitor
and ATR inhibitor (WEE1i-ATRi) treatment, 2) WEE1i-ATRi increases tumor regression in a CCNE1-level-
dependent manner in PDXs, 3) Differential molecular effects of WEE1i and ATRi promote replication fork
collapse, and 4) CCNE1 amplification is a reliable biomarker predictive of response to WEE1i-ATRi. These
findings indicated that a combination of WEE1 kinase inhibitor (WEE1i) and ATR inhibitor (ATRi) is a feasible
approach for the treatment of PARPi-resistant Cyclin E (CCNE1) overexpressing (CCNE1HIGH) high-grade serous
ovarian cancer (HGSOC). These results provide a strong rationale for Atrin to develop a first-in-class combination
of WEE1i and ATRi that can allow lower-dosing strategies to mitigate off-target toxicity for the treatment of
HGSOCs. Atrin Pharmaceuticals, Inc has been in the field of DDR for over a decade and is pioneering the
development of next-generation, selective ATRi. We have discovered ATRN-119 as a highly selective ATRi and
have received FDA IND approval (IND #141317). In parallel, we have also discovered a highly selective WEE1
inhibitor demonstrating high potency on WEE1 kinase, superior selectivity over PLK1, and significant anti-growth
activity against various cancer cell lines of NCI-60 panel with high potency. In addition, our WEE1i exhibits
superior potency in OVCAR8 cells compared to AZD1775. Pharmacokinetic (PK) study in mice shows superior
oral bioavailability compared to AZD1775. In an OVCAR-3 xenograft tumor model, it alone completely halts tumor
growth without causing loss of body weight. Importantly, our WEE1i sensitizes the ovarian cancer cell line
(OVCAR8) to ATRN-119. Given these promising results, we proposed to 1) Quantify sensitivity of HGSOC to our
WEE1i and ATRN-119 alone as well the combination in PDX models of HGSOC. 2) Identify additional biomarkers
to expand target patient populations, 3) Evaluate the toxicity, and 4) Obtain a GMP batch of API. The success
of our Direct-to-Phase II project will further support chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) to manufacture
clinical supply of our novel WEE1i and complete FDA-required IND-enabling pharmacology safety and toxicology
studies. In addition, findings from this project will inform clinical trial protocols using our first-in-class combination
for the treatment of HGSOC, which critically needs more efficacious treatments."
10815770,"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) that drive cancer metastasis through paracrine
and autocrine signaling. While the role of specific exosome cargoes in this process is not well
understood, integrin adhesion receptors have been shown to be involved in the choice of
metastatic site. How this occurs is not entirely clear, but could involve binding of exosome-
carried integrins to cognate extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands in distant tissues. Another non-
exclusive possibility is that exosomal integrins and other adhesion receptors directly initiate
assembly of ECM to allow cancer cell survival and invasion at primary tumor sites and
colonization of distant metastatic sites. We will investigate these possible functions of
exosomes in breast cancer metastasis.
 In the prior grant cycle, we identified fundamental mechanisms by which both cancer-
and stromal-derived exosomes control tumor aggressiveness, including: 1) autocrine promotion
of cancer cell migration; 2) fibroblast exosomes are necessary and sufficient to induce assembly
of fibronectin and other stromal matrix proteins, both in vitro and in vivo; 3) and fibroblast-
secreted exosomes promote both growth and metastasis of primary breast tumors. In addition,
we find that adhesion receptors are enriched on small EVs from both cancer cells and
fibroblasts. Based on these other findings, we propose the central hypothesis that adhesion
molecules carried by breast cancer and fibroblast exosomes drive multiple steps of the
metastatic cascade. To test this hypothesis, we will: 1) Test the hypothesis that clustering of
integrins and syndecans within exosomes mediates fibronectin (FN) assembly; 2) Test the
hypothesis that breast cancer cell exosomes carry unique adhesion molecules that can induce
assembly of epithelial-type ECM; 3) Determine the role of exosomal adhesion receptors in
promoting breast cancer metastasis."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) often leads to irreversible deterioration of kidney function that often progresses
to End Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD). CKD has emerged as a serious public health issue and data obtained
from the USRDS reveals that the number 20 million patients in the United States suffer from CKD. As
glomerular diseases secondary to podocyte dysfunction account for greater than 80% of all CKD, an intensive
molecular and genetic approach to identify mechanisms for podocyte development, maintenance and repair
may provide new therapeutic targets Recent evidence suggests an important role of glomerular injury
exacerbated by calpain activation. Using a unbiased screen, we have identified Pfn1, as potentially a critical
gene to maintain the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. Loss of PFN1 in human podocytes resulted in
multinucleated cells, increased calcium, and calpain 2 activation. Therefore, In Aim 1, we will define the
fundamental mechanisms on how loss of Pfn1 contributes to podocyte dysfunction through characterizing the
new generated knockout mice. In Aim 2, we will characterize the role of Capn2 to stabilize podocyte function
and further investigate the link between Pfn1 and Capn2. Our mouse models of disease provide impetus to
further define the role of Pfn1 and Capn2 in the formation and maintenance an intact glomerular filtration
barrier."

meningitis, and sepsis in neonates when transmitted from mother to child. In addition, GBS can
cause a range of diseases in immunocompromised adults and the elderly, including urinary tract
infections, pneumonia, and meningitis. GBS has to compete with other microbiome members in
different niches of the human host. Other Firmicutes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus

intrabacterial or interbacterial antagonism. Analyses of GBS genomes revealed the presence of
putative T7SS loci. These gene clusters encode the core components of T7SS machinery as
well as putative secreted effectors/toxins. The goals of this application are to define the function
of GBS T7SS in vaginal colonization and to characterize the role of GBS T7SS in interbacterial
antagonism. We propose to assess the contribution of the GBS T7SS to GBS adherence,
invasion, and host responses of the vaginal epithelium using in vitro human vaginal cell lines
and mouse models of GBS vaginal colonization. We will also study the contribution of the GBS
T7SS to GBS competition with other microbes in vitro and in humanized microbiota mouse

of GBS T7SS to interbacterial interactions that shape the outcome of the host infection."

 The Dalia lab studies the regulation and mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer by natural
transformation (NT) using Vibrio cholerae as a model system. While this bacterium is the causative agent of
the diarrheal disease cholera, we do not seek to study bacterial pathogenesis. Instead, we leverage this well-
established model system and the genetic tools we have developed to characterize NT in a physiologically
relevant context. NT contributes to the rapid spread of antibiotic resistance determinants and virulence factors
in bacterial pathogens. Thus, characterizing the regulation and mechanisms of NT may uncover novel
approaches to combat diverse clinically relevant infections.
 The genes required for NT are tightly regulated, and only induced when V. cholerae forms biofilms on
the chitinous shells of crustacean zooplankton in the aquatic environment. The formation of chitin biofilms is
also important for the survival of this facultative pathogen in its environmental reservoir, and promotes the
waterborne transmission of cholera. Vibrio-chitin interactions can be easily studied in a lab setting, which
provides a physiologically relevant and highly tractable model system for studying NT. In the next five years,
we will focus on three major areas. First, V. cholerae uses dynamic surface appendages called type IV pili to
bind to chitinous surfaces and to take up DNA for NT. The mechanisms that regulate the dynamic extension
and retraction of these appendages, however, remains poorly characterized. Using tools we helped develop to
label type IV pili in live cells, we will address how motor ATPases, minor pilins, and other environmental cues
regulate pilus dynamic activity. Second, we will study how two membrane-embedded DNA-binding
transcription factors, ChiS and TfoS, coordinate to activate the chitin regulon in V. cholerae. Membrane-
embedded regulators are understudied, and this work will help elucidate the dynamics and constraints for the
DNA-binding activity of membrane-embedded vs soluble transcription factors. Third, we will use a combination
of cell biological and genetic approaches to study horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation. Namely,
we will address the spatiotemporal dynamics of natural transformation within chitin biofilms; and the impact of
neighbor predation on these dynamics. Also, we will formally test the long-standing, yet untested, hypothesis
that DNA uptake during natural transformation plays an important nutritional role. Together, our basic research
extends a fundamental understanding of a number of critical and conserved processes (e.g. pili, signal
transduction, horizontal gene transfer) that are shared by diverse microbial species, including many pathogens."
10877673,"The role of proBDNF-p75NTR signaling in hind limb ischemia
 Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its precursor proBDNF have been well characterized in
their contrasting roles in neuroprotection and neuroinflammation in the central nervous system respectively.
Recently, BDNF and proBDNF have been shown to exist in tissues outside of the central nervous system, but
their role in these tissues is still unclear. In my study it was shown that whole muscle lysate contains high
levels of proBDNF and relatively low levels of mature BDNF compared to whole brain lysate. This project aims
to investigate the functional role of skeletal muscle-derived proBDNF in hind limb ischemia-reperfusion (IR)
injury. In this model, in which C57BL/6 mice are subjected to ligation of the right hind limb, proBDNF and its
receptor p75NTR were both upregulated, and p75NTR downstream signaling pathways were activated in the
ischemic muscle compared to the contralateral control limb muscles. The data further showed that treatment
with LM11A-31, a p75NTR moderator, following IR injury improved perfusion of the ischemic limb compared to
untreated IR controls, indicating improved endothelial function. Moreover, skeletal muscle-specific knockout of
BDNF significantly improved the blood perfusion in the ischemic limb compared to wild-type mice. Previous
studies have suggested that endothelial p75NTR may mediate vascular injury. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that the upregulated proBDNF in skeletal muscle following IR injury may stimulate endothelial
p75NTR, promoting cleavage of the intercellular domain (ICD) and subsequent inhibition of PKA-induced
phosphorylation of eNOS and nitric oxide production leading to vascular dysfunction and inflammation. To test
this hypothesis, mice with skeletal muscle-specific knockout of BDNF will be used to determine the role of
muscle-derived proBDNF in IR injury. Then mice with endothelial-specific knockout of p75NTR will be used to
examine whether endothelial p75NTR mediates IR injury. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments will be used
to define the inhibition of PKA by the ICD of p75NTR and subsequent eNOS function being responsible for the
IR injury. The results of this project will reveal a novel mechanism underlying IR injury and suggest new targets
for the prevention and treatment of IR injury in patients. While under the superior intellectual guidance and

Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 1 (CLN1) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with infantile onset.
CLN1 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1), a critical
depalmitoylating enzyme in the brain. CLN1 and other genetic forms of this disorder (NCLs) are characterized
by common clinical symptoms and neuropathological hallmarks. Symptoms include seizures, vision loss, and
progressive motor and cognitive decline, while the brains of NCL patients exhibit cortical neuron loss, retinal
degeneration, and the accumulation of lipofuscin, an autofluorescent lysosomal storage material with largely
undescribed composition. The understanding of the molecular basis of CLN1, and hence the development of
treatments, has been hindered by the limited repertoire of known PPT1 substrates. We recently identified more
than 100 novel PPT1 substrates and documented a small subset of lysosomal proteins that are both highly
upregulated and palmitoylated at early-stage disease in a CLN1 mouse model. Strikingly, these proteins include
causal genes and genetic modifiers of NCLs and other lysosomal storage disorders. Further, these salient NCL
proteins remain upregulated as CLN1 progresses, and are found, along with validated PPT1 substrates, to
accumulate in proteomic datasets of human age-related lipofuscin. These data strongly suggest that CLN1,
other forms of NCL, and pathological aging share common molecular mechanisms. However, it remains unclear
why this subset of lysosomal storage disorder proteins accumulates in CLN1 and during aging and how they
contribute to lipofuscin pathology. The proposed research takes advantage of a key opportunity to dissect these
putative etiological relationships.
In Aim 1, I will determine if NCL proteins are PPT1 substrates with in vitro depalmitoylation assays and uncover
if CLN1 is accompanied by deficits in the lysosomal functions of NCL proteins with hydrolase activity panels.
This aim will thus expand the known PPT1 substrate repertoire and detail critical mechanistic links between
NCLs. The degradation, trafficking, and lysosomal compartmentalization of NCL proteins will then be tested in
Aim 2 using cycloheximide chases, live-cell imaging, and immunocytochemistry. Regardless of whether NCL
proteins are PPT1 substrates, this approach will provide a mechanistic basis for their upregulation. Finally, in
Aim 3, the composition of CLN1 lipofuscin, including the constituency of NCL proteins and palmitate lipids, will
be assessed with electron microscopy and state-of-the art mass spectrometry techniques. Together, the
realization of these studies will reveal novel roles of PPT1 in neuronal function and convergent molecular
mechanisms of NCL and aging pathogenesis, which may provide therapeutic targets. Mentorship from a diverse
panel of experts in my proposed techniques will facilitate my training as an independent cellular and molecular
neurobiologist."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurological disorder characterized by the accumulation of microtubule-
associated protein tau into many abnormal intraneuronal aggregates detected at distinct brain regions. Their
emergence strongly correlates with the progressive severity of AD diagnosed patients’ clinical symptoms and
neuropathological features. These observations suggest tau aggregation plays a crucial and toxic role in AD.
Tau is a monomeric highly soluble protein that maintains the assembly and stability of microtubules. Tau’s
function is regulated through post-translational modifications (PTMs) of a specific number of residues, primarily
phosphorylation. Previous studies indicate that the tau proteins that make up polymorphous insoluble tau
aggregates (e.g., neurofibrillary tangles) have abnormal hyperphosphorylation. Based on these observations, it
is suggested that ubiquitous hyperphosphorylation of tau promotes its aggregation in disease. However, the
precise link between the pattern and degree of tau hyperphosphorylation with aggregation is unclear.
Furthermore, how a heavily molecularly modified protein can form a wide range of morphologically diverse
aggregates within one disease is not well-understood. These questions have not been investigated thoroughly
due to the diffraction limit of conventional light microscopy (~250nm), in which aggregates of a size well below
this limit are not resolvable. By labeling human postmortem AD brain tissues with multiple hyperphosphorylation-
specific phosphor-tau antibodies and super-resolution imaging, I have been able to identify tau oligomers ( 20-
30 nm), linear fibrils (30-250 nm), branched fibrils (50-350 nm), and NFTs (>1μm). Based on this preliminary
data, I hypothesize that the tau oligomers/small fibrils present in AD have unique PTM profiles that arise from
the combination of tau proteins hyperphosphorylated at different residues. I also hypothesize that
morphologically distinct insoluble tau aggregates in AD have unique PTM profiles and that these profiles match
the PTM profiles of tau oligomers/small fibrils. To test these hypotheses, the aims established in this proposal
will determine the relative frequency of tau proteins carrying a particular array of hyperphosphorylated sites
within tau oligomers, fibrils, and NFTs. I will achieve this by combinatorial immunostaining with established
phosphor-tau antibodies, multicolor super-resolution imaging, and advanced quantitative analysis using machine
learning to rigorously evaluate the hyperphosphorylation profiles of all tau aggregates present in human AD
tissues. These studies will demonstrate that it is possible to determine the PTM profiles of tau oligomers and
morphologically distinct insoluble tau aggregates in human AD tissue. Furthermore, these research strategies
will open the door to compare tau oligomer PTM heterogeneity across several tauopathies, including Cortical
basal degeneration and Pick’s disease. Furthermore, the research strategies developed herein can be applied
to study the PTM profiles of other aggregation-prone proteins, including α-synuclein, huntingtin, and others."
10763818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common adult bacterial infection annually affecting
over 150 million individuals worldwide. As a common reason for antibiotic prescriptions, UTIs are considered a
substantial source of resistance to antimicrobial agents. Thus, improved understanding of the interactions
between host and bacterial pathogen during UTI is essential for facilitating the development of new therapeutic
agents. The concentration of copper increases 5-fold in the urine during acute infection as a protective strategy
against the pathogen. Most copper is excreted in the intestines where uropathogens colonize following UTI
forming the basis for recurrent infections. Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), the most common cause of
UTIs, uses copper efflux and sequestration mechanisms to prevent copper toxicity. Additionally, UPEC inhabits
multiple niches (intestines, vagina, and bladder) throughout the host that vary in copper content and oxygen
concentration. While copper response mechanisms have been characterized in laboratory strains of E. coli, the
relative contribution of each copper response system to UPEC persistence in the host has not been elucidated.
This proposal will determine the spatio-temporal induction and regulation of the UPEC response to copper and
will define the role of each response system in mediating UPEC persistence in the host.
Rationale and Hypothesis: In order to successfully infect the urinary tract, UPEC must tolerate increased
copper levels. Similarly, UPEC must tolerate intestinal copper excretion to colonize the host gut and potentially
cause re-infections. Based on prior studies, the copper responsive UPEC locus cus is among the most
upregulated of all genes in samples from acute human UTIs. The cus locus encodes the two-component
signaling system CusSR, a copper sensing and response signaling system, and copper efflux apparatus
CusCFBA. Additionally, the copper response systems CueR/CopA facilitate copper export in aerobic conditions.
Oxygen availability is a key determinant of which copper response system is preferentially active in E. coli due
to the oxidation state of copper and energetic requirements for copper efflux. Oxygen levels vary widely within
UPEC’s niches. I hypothesize that oxygen availability and copper levels dictate the copper response
systems that are active in the anatomic niches that UPEC colonizes and infects. I propose two aims to test
this hypothesis:
Aims: Aim 1 will determine which UPEC copper response systems are active in the anatomic niches (vagina,
intestines, bladder) that UPEC encounters. Aim 2 will investigate the role of CusSR in mediating copper sensing
and tolerance in the anaerobic intestinal niche.
Impact: These studies will be the first to address the hierarchy and localization of copper response systems
uropathogenesis. Clarification of how UPEC senses and responds to copper will provide insight into whether
targeting copper detoxification methods of UPEC is a viable therapeutic option for UTI treatment and prevention."
10834052,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mexican older adults are projected to face disproportionate rates of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD) [1], but the underlying environmental and genetic factors accounting for these ADRD disparities are
not fully understood. A proposed mechanism for these disparities is the cumulative disadvantage theory,
wherein differential exposure to different genetic or environmental risk factors across the life course
accumulate in ways that contribute to greater prevalence of ADRD [2-4]. However, the ability to systematically
test whether this theory accounts for the observed disparities has been hindered by a lack of research on
genetic and social environmental ADRD risk factors among Mexican older adults. The proposed study will
clarify environmental conditions under which genetic expression of ADRD in Mexican older adults is maximized
and minimized. First, I will specify effects of multiple environmental factors (i.e., education, literacy,
socioeconomic status, rurality, and migration) on ADRD risk. Second, I will test the modifying role of each
environmental factor on effects of apolipoprotein-E (APOE) on ADRD risk. Third, I will test the modifying role of
each environmental factor on effects a polygenic risk score (PRS) for ADRD developed specifically in persons
of Mexican ancestry on ADRD risk. No research to date has examined gene-by-environmental risk factors for
ADRD risk in Mexican older adults. The proposed study will leverage a large-scale community-based dataset,
the Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS; Mexico), the sample in which the Mexican origin PRS has been
developed. The proposed training and research plan address the following research questions: Which
environmental risk factors contribute to ADRD risk in Mexican older adults? To what extent do environmental
risk factors moderate effects of common ADRD genetic risk variants in Mexican older adults? To address these
questions, the following specific aims will be addressed: 1) Test whether the environmental factors influence
ADRD risk scores in Mexican older adults via a latent dementia index (LDI); 2) Test whether environmental
factors moderate APOE ε4 effects on LDI scores in Mexican adults; 3) Test whether environmental factors
moderate the Mexican origin PRS effects on LDI scores in Mexican older adults. The proposed project will be
the first study to elucidate the genetic and environmental influences that may underlie the elevated ADRD risk
in Mexican older adults. Improved understanding of the role of these factors will also have important
implications for public health, as this study will provide empirical evidence to inform and develop targeted
intervention strategies that may mitigate ADRD risk among Mexican older adults."

X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) affects approximately 1 in 500 males. Recently, we, and others, have
discovered multiple unique missense mutations in the X-linked gene encoding O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) that
are causal for XLID. These mutations generate variants with amino acid substitutions in either the TPR domain
or catalytic domain of OGT. The modification of Ser/Thr residues of thousands of nuclear and cytosolic proteins
by the addition of a single glycan (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, O-GlcNAc) by OGT can impact the stability,
localization, activity, and protein-protein interactions of the modified proteins. Similar to phosphorylation, the O-
GlcNAc modification is inducible and dynamic. However, unlike phosphorylation, which is mediated by hundreds
of kinases and a smaller set of phosphatases, O-GlcNAc modification results from the activity of a single
transferase (OGT) that can be removed by a single hydrolase (O-GlcNAc hydrolase, OGA). We have generated
considerable published and preliminary data including biochemical characterization of several OGT-TPR
variants, engineering of an isotope-based approach to quantitatively compare site-specific O-GlcNAc between
samples and establish turnover rates, generation of Cas9-engineered RUES-1 stem cells harboring the XLID
missense mutations, and defining the OGT TPR interactome including defining interactors, such as the
epigenetic regulator TET2 and the synapse scaffolding protein PCLO, that show reduced interactions with XLID
TPR variants. Based on our preliminary data, we will test the hypothesis that OGT-TPR variants have an altered
interactome and define the impact of loss of interaction (Aim 1A). In Aim 1B, we will characterize novel XLID
variants in the catalytic domain of OGT that, based on modeling and in cellulo expression studies, we
hypothesize will be Km variants for the sugar nucleotide donor and perform genome wide screens to identify
regulators of OGT expression that might be able to ameliorate the deficits of a catalytic variant. Finally, given the
nearly identical and overlapping patient phenotypes for both TPR and catalytic domain XLID OGT variants, we
will test the hypothesis that all variants share common downstream alterations, likely in gene regulation that may
be modulated by TET2 and associated proteins (Aim 2) and/or synaptic activity modulated by PCLO and
associated proteins (Aim 3) based on preliminary and published data. The successful completion of these aims,
geared towards elucidating a mechanistic understanding of the impact of XLID OGT variants, will advance both
the intellectual disability and O-GlcNAc fields."
10831828,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Evidence that anxious smokers experience lower cessation success and account for a greater proportion of
tobacco-related disease and disability underscores the need to identify common factors that underlie this
comorbidity and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population. Research initiatives addressing cigarette use
and anxiety have largely overlooked physiological mechanisms that facilitate body-brain communication,
despite their promise as malleable intervention targets. To address this gap, study designs are needed that
characterize (1) the effects of cigarette use on physiological processes that support body-brain communication
and (2) how these impairments confer anxiety risk in human models.
This application proposes that the baroreflex, a well-delineated feedback loop through which body-brain
communication occurs, is likely to be impaired in cigarette smokers and, as a result, may undermine core
learning processes that confer anxiety risk. The proposed study will involve a single in-person laboratory visit
during which 66 participants (n=33 smokers; n=33 non-smokers) will complete a fear conditioning paradigm
while baroreflex function assessed. Dependent variables include: (1) baroreflex function indexed via
electrocardiograph and blood pressure data and (2) fear inhibition indexed via skin conductance response
during the paradigm’s extinction training phase. Analysis of variance, linear regression, and mediation
modeling will be used to examine group differences in baroreflex function between smokers and non-smokers
(Aim 1), the relationship between baroreflex function and fear inhibition (Aim 2), and the direct and indirect
effects of smoking status on fear inhibition through the baroreflex (Aim 3), respectively. Findings will refine
knowledge of physiological processes implicated in anxiety, smoking, and their high comorbidity.
The applicant is applying for an F31 award to receive high caliber training in the design and implementation of
mechanism-focused addiction research (Goal 1), translational models of anxiety pathology (Goal 2),
psychophysiological interpretation and analysis (Goal 3), and professional development (Goal 4). The research
and training plan will lay the foundation for the applicant’s future line of research to examine how substance-
related impairments in physiological function promote anxiety risk and maintain substance use behavior.
Receiving an F31 fellowship will relieve the applicant from her time-intensive teaching assistant position to
effectively to conduct research and establish a strong interdisciplinary network in the addiction science field."

E-cigarette use has increased rapidly in recent years and is now the most commonly used tobacco product
among youth. Research has demonstrated that social networks (i.e. influence from friends) has an effect on
adolescent tobacco use. However, no studies have examined the association between e-cigarette use and
adolescent social networks over time. One possible mechanism driving e-cigarette use may be perceived
friend norms, an individual’s beliefs or perceptions about the behaviors of friends and the desire to conform to
these norms. However, these perceived norms are often not aligned with reality, as people often overestimate
risk behaviors among friends, and actual e-cigarette use among friends may be much lower than adolescents
believe. Currently, no studies have explored the interaction between perceived friend norms and friend use on
individual e-cigarette use. This study will fill this research gap by analyzing friendship networks, allowing us to
gain unique insight into the social dynamics influencing individual e-cigarette use. Understanding these
relationships is critical for understanding the social mechanisms driving e-cigarette use among adolescents.
This project will use data from two high school cohorts being recruited in current NIH-funded studies where
students will complete surveys about tobacco/e-cigarette use, social network (friendship) questions, and other
demographics. They will be followed throughout high school, resulting in longitudinal data on e-cigarette use
and social networks. As adolescent friendship networks evolve over time, it is likely that perceived norms and
patterns of e-cigarette use change as well. The longitudinal nature of the study allows us to evaluate friend
influence and friend selection in relation to e-cigarette use (i.e. if people form friendships based on similar e-
cigarette use behavior). Building on the previously funded R01, the objectives of this study are to (1) Assess
the association between perceived peer norms, peer use, and individual e-cigarette use. (2) Evaluate the
longitudinal relationship between friend influence and friend selection on e-cigarette use. (3) Use a simulation
model based on collected data to demonstrate the effects of varying levels of perceived peer norms and peer
e-cigarette use on individual e-cigarette use. This novel methodological approach allows us to model how
hypothetical changes in perceived norms or e-cigarette use in the network would change individual e-cigarette
use outcomes. The results of these analyses can be used to incorporate social networks into future
interventions to change peer norm perceptions and ultimately decrease e-cigarette use among adolescents."

Cancer is characterized by genomic, epigenetic, and metabolic changes, but also by a failure in cell/nuclear size
control. Nevertheless, little is known about size regulation in cancer cells and whether failures in size control
contribute to tumorigenesis. Whole genome doubling (WGD), which results in tetraploidy and is a frequent
intermediate event in tumor progression, is a key process that can alter cell and nuclear size. However, while
ploidy and nuclear size tend to scale proportionally in normal human cells, DNA content and nuclear size do not
always correlate in cancer cells. This suggests that understanding how nuclear size is controlled following
changes in DNA content may uncover important mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. Addressing this issue
requires a suitable experimental model, such as the one that will be used for this project. This model consists of
a panel of tetraploid (4N) clonal cell lines that were derived by inducing WGD in colorectal and breast cancer
cells and can be divided into two groups (small and large) based on nuclear size. Previous studies showed that
the small and large 4N DLD1 clones display distinct mitotic phenotypes, which raised important questions about
the mechanisms of size control in 4N cells and the impact of nuclear size on other cell phenotypes. Indeed,
preliminary results indicate that the small 4N clones have increased tumor-like behavior in vitro, outperforming
the large 4N clones and 2N parental cells in soft agar colony formation assays. These size-specific phenotypic
differences suggest that the small 4N clones may also be more tumorigenic in vivo than the large 4N clones due
to their ability to restrict nuclear size scaling after WGD. This hypothesis will be tested in a first research aim
using a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico methods and two experimental models, including the novel
panel of small and large 4N clones derived from 2N DLD1 cells (for a running total of 16 cell lines) and genomic,
histopathology, and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A second research aim will test the
hypothesis that the nuclear volumes of the 4N clones are dictated by the degree of genomic compaction and will
identify the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate nuclear size after WGD in colon- and breast-
derived cells. These experiments will address a fundamental yet underexplored question of whether variations
in nuclear size have important functional consequences that contribute to tumor formation following WGD. The
findings of this project could be leveraged for cancer diagnostics and unveil new cancer therapeutic targets. This
project will provide ample training opportunities in the use of animal models, computational analysis, and mass
spectrometry from an interdisciplinary group of leading researchers to help the applicant become an independent
scientist. The intellectual environment, resources, and training programs provided to the applicant are rich and
complementary to the proposed research project. Moreover, the collective institutional environment is strongly
supportive of multidisciplinary research, and it is instrumental to the success of the proposed studies and
scientific development of the applicant."

Gene expression regulation is critical for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Dysregulation of genes disrupts
normal cell physiology and very frequently leads to diseases such as cancer, developmental disorders, and
neurodegenerative diseases. Gene regulation, however, occurs at different levels, and many genes are
regulated post-transcriptionally at the RNA level. Two major methods of post-transcriptional gene regulation are
RNA processing and RNA degradation, which function to regulate the steady-state level of different RNAs in the
cell (quantity control) and to ensure the destruction of aberrant mRNAs that, if translated, would be deleterious
to the cell (quality control). These processes involve the actions of enzymes called ribonucleases, and mutations
in several of these enzymes have been found to cause human disease. Yet, the vast spectrum of enzymes
involved in these processes has not been completely uncovered, and many rare inherited diseases have
unknown underlying causes. Additionally, even proteins with known ribonuclease functions remain poorly
characterized. Therefore, this project aims to investigate the roles of five proteins in messenger RNA (mRNA)
processing and degradation, with the ultimate objective of better understanding these essential gene expression-
regulating processes. The first goal of this proposal will be the identification of endonuclease targets and specific
cleavage sites, which will be accomplished using a streamlined bioinformatics approach. Additionally, this study
will identify the sequence-specific and/or structural determinants of endonuclease target recognition and
cleavage, determine the impact of sub-cellular localization on target selection, investigate the enzymes'
contributions to cellular homeostasis, and determine the physiological consequences of endonuclease
dysregulation. Gaining molecular insight into the endonuclease functions of the proteins described in this study
will fill considerable gaps in our current understanding of RNA regulatory networks. These discoveries could
additionally reveal important links between the critical RNA control mechanisms of processing and degradation,
and the manifestation of human disease."
10767804,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Falls present a significant problem as the leading cause of accidental death in older adults (OA). OA are
particularly susceptible to falls due to effects of neurotypical aging, which alters neuromotor pathways important
in balance control. Individuals with aging- or pathology-related declines in motor function are thought to leverage
inputs from prefrontal cognitive regions to support impaired descending cortical motor circuits during balance
challenges. In adults with impaired balance, reliance on attention to control balance poses a problem when the
individual becomes distracted, and even more so if they have reduced neuromotor resources for balance. For
this reason, individuals with cognitive decline such OA with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are more susceptible
to falls. Despite this increased fall-risk in MCI, there are few effective strategies to rehabilitate balance in MCI,
and their poor cognitive abilities reduce the effectiveness of many existing training-based balance interventions.
There is a need for rehabilitative strategies to enhance underlying cognitive-motor circuit function to improve
balance function in OA with and without MCI. However, our ability to develop more effective balance treatments
is limited by our lack of knowledge of the cognitive-motor pathway interactions underlying fall-risk. The objective
of this F31 project is to characterize cognitive-motor circuit interactions important in balance control. The
proposed research will use non-invasive neurostimulation to characterize effective connectivity from a primary
cognitive area, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), to the primary motor cortex (M1), as a function of age,
balance task difficulty, DLPFC engagement, and cognitive impairment. The rigor of previous work by my
sponsors and others has shown correlational evidence that functional connectivity between prefrontal cortex and
M1 is modulated as a factor of balance task difficulty in and individual balance ability. I will focus on more directly
identifying top-down inputs from the DLPFC (involved in attention allocation and attention-based balance control)
to leg areas of M1. Dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used to evaluate effective
connectivity, or causal and directional relationships between DLPFC and M1 circuits (DLPFC→M1). I
hypothesize that prefrontal cognitive regions are recruited to modulate motor pathways at higher levels of task
difficulty as necessitated by individual balance and cognitive ability. I will test this hypothesis by: 1) measuring
the effect of balance challenge and aging on DLPFC→M1 in easy and difficult standing balance tasks. 2) Testing
the effect of cognitive engagement and aging on DLPFC→M1 across balance tasks using a cognitive-motor
dual-task. 3) Testing the effect of cognitive impairment on DLPFC→M1 across balance tasks and cognitive-
motor dual-tasks. This paradigm will be the first investigation of DLPFC→ lower limb M1 in the context of
functionally relevant standing balance tasks. In the long-term, this work will help develop mechanism-informed
neuromodulation treatments to improve balance control, neurophysiological biomarkers to predict falls risk and
rehabilitation response, and neurobiology-informed, precision (p)rehabilitation to reduce falls in OA and MCI."

 Studies of the human microbiome have demonstrated that bacteria play a once overlooked, but important
role in health and disease. In turn, therapeutic interventions that attempt to reprogram the microbiome to promote
health or treat disease have garnered increased attention. The utility of using live bacteria as medicine was once
limited by their native behavior. Modern synthetic biology tools, however, make it possible to genetically encode
functions into microorganisms, expanding their potential roles as therapeutics. One such burgeoning application
is to engineer microbes to function as synthetic factories within the gut, enabling the delivery of medicinal
compounds from within. Live bacterial therapeutics programmed to deliver metabolic enzymes, for example,
have been efficacious towards rescuing inborn errors of metabolism in mouse models. To date, the delivery of
therapeutic compounds by bacteria in vivo has been limited to ribosomally-synthesized active agents (i.e.
enzymes, proteins, peptidic hormones). Despite the known biosynthetic capability of microbes to make a
dazzling array of small molecule natural products, there are no existing studies that have harnessed this
prowess towards the development of a microbiome-based therapeutic. In this proposal, I aim to engineer
the probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle (EcN) to produce the neuropharmaceutical prodrug candidate L-4-
chlorokynurenine (4CK) and then test its ability to function inside a mouse model. In doing so, I will explore the
capacity of probiotics to synthesize non-native metabolites inside an animal host, which could give rise to a new
mechanism for the sustained delivery of small molecule drugs.
 In aim 1, I will genetically program EcN to synthesize 4CK and optimize production. This will require
cloning and refactoring a heterologous 4CK biosynthetic pathway as well as manipulating the endogenous
metabolism of the EcN chassis. In aim 2, I will use a growth-coupled selection system in Pseudomonas putida
to evolve the biosynthetic enzymes. Improved enzyme variants will be re-engineered into EcN. In aim 3, the
optimized strain will be administered to mice and systemic distribution of 4CK evaluated. This will include
assessing production in the gut, absorption into the bloodstream and transport to the brain. This proposal is
designed to provide a multidisciplinary training opportunity combining my interests in natural products,
bioengineering, microbiome science, and biomedical research and is strongly supported by a diverse team of
advisors who are experts in these fields.

Alcohol exposure is a key risk factor for abnormal heart development and contributes to congenital heart disease,
the leading non-infectious cause of infant mortality. Alcohol-induced impaired heart growth and development in
early life can also increase the risk of heart disease later in adulthood. Furthermore, adult cardiac system is also
sensitive to alcohol exposure, which is an important but underappreciated risk factor contributing to heart
disease. Alcohol exposure is associated with ischemic events, arrhythmias and alterations in cardiac function
and structure. These pathological consequences could result from complex actions of alcohol including
increased cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and abnormal Ca2+ handling. Inflammatory cytokines produced by alcohol
exposure could also contribute to alcohol-induced heart injury. However, mechanisms underlying alcohol-
induced heart disease are not fully defined and effective therapies are lacking.
Traditionally, studies on alcohol exposure have relied on animal models and cells because of limited availability
and growth capacity of human primary cardiomyocytes. However, studies in animal models are time consuming,
expensive, and not amenable for high-throughput drug screening, and have limitations due to physiological
differences from humans. To complement the studies on animal models and cells, we have recently explored
the use of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) as a novel and
physiologically relevant model to study alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity. hiPSC-CMs have many features similar
to human primary CMs, can be engineered into tissue-like structures and maintained in long-term cultures, and
can be adapted for high-throughput platforms.
We have demonstrated that exposure of hiPSC-CMs with clinically relevant doses of alcohol can recapitulate
pathological events caused by alcohol exposure, including oxidative stress, altered gene expression and cardiac
dysfunction as indicated by abnormal Ca2+ handling and contractility. We have adapted hiPSC-CMs into high-
throughput formats and established high-throughput assays to detect alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity and screen
for cardiac proliferative/protective agents. Using this in vitro human cell model and state-of-the-art high-
throughput technologies, we propose to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced toxicity
in human cardiomyocytes and evaluate potential therapies to mitigate alcohol-induced cytotoxicity. In addition,
we plan to investigate the involvement of inflammatory cytokines in alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair.
We expect that our established hiPSC-CM model will help understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms
underlying alcohol toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and accelerate the development of targeted and effective
therapies."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease marked by debilitating inflammation and destruction of
synovial joints. Even with targeted therapies such as anti-TNF, few patients achieve remission and there is no
cure. The residual disease and recurrent flares exhibited by RA patients suggest that bona fide resolution of
synovial inflammation remains impaired. Improved knowledge of the mechanisms that resolve inflammation and
restore synovial homeostasis is acutely needed. In this proposal, we study a novel pro-resolving mechanism in
RA driven by fibroblasts within the synovial tissue. This differs from known pro-resolving mechanisms in
synovium and elsewhere, which are mediated by leukocytes. Both in RA and other inflammatory diseases,
stromal fibroblasts have emerged as powerful regulators of local immune responses in addition to modulating
tissue architecture and fibrosis. Having previously identified key mechanisms by which fibroblasts control
inflammatory activation in RA, we now examined whether fibroblasts play similarly instrumental roles in
regulating inflammatory resolution. Through single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, we observed that synovial
fibroblasts express higher levels of the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase during RA remission. AXL and other
receptors in the TAM (TYRO3/AXL/MERTK) family have pro-resolving functions attributed to leukocytes.
However, in synovium, we find that AXL is expressed markedly more highly by fibroblasts than leukocytes. We
show that upon AXL activation, fibroblasts downregulate key inflammatory markers and also efferocytose
apoptotic cells, contributing to their clearance. Here we will determine whether AXL signaling in synovial
fibroblasts represents a novel, leukocyte-independent pathway driving inflammatory resolution. To
accomplish this, in Aim 1, we define the effects of AXL on synovial fibroblast inflammatory polarization by
identifying the key transcriptional and phosphorylated targets of AXL signaling. In Aim 2, we assess how AXL-
mediated binding and uptake of apoptotic cells by synovial fibroblasts facilitates their transcriptional and
metabolic reprogramming towards immunoregulatory or pro-resolving states. Finally, in Aim 3, we test whether
targeted, conditional depletion of AXL in synovial fibroblasts exacerbates arthritis severity or delays its resolution
in mouse models. Together, these studies will advance our knowledge of fibroblast function and regulation during
inflammatory resolution, potentially paving the way for novel stromal-targeted, pro-resolving therapies that foster
long-lasting remission in multiple inflammatory diseases."

Alzheimer disease (AD) affects approximately 6 million people in the United States and currently has no
clearly-effective disease modifying therapies. AD is pathologically defined by the accumulation of amyloid β
(Aβ) plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the brain and it is known that alterations in the activities of
microglia and other non-neuronal cell types play important roles in shaping the disease course. Much of the
polygenic risk for AD is derived from variants in genes expressed by microglia, specifically those involved in
endolysosomal and lipid processing pathways, and microglia containing abundant lipid droplets (LD-MG) have
been observed in post-mortem human AD brains. As previous interventions targeting Aβ have not yet been
successful in clinical trials, the concept of modulating microglial lipid metabolism is a novel and exciting avenue
being explored in preclinical studies, however we need to know more about how lipid metabolism governs
microglial functional states. In mouse models of amyloidosis, microglia transition from a homeostatic to a
disease-associated (DAM) transcriptional state that represents a protective, phagocytic, and plaque-
compacting phenotype. While microglial activity may be beneficial in the early amyloid phase of AD,
pharmacological or genetic inhibition of microglia has been shown to be protective in mouse models of
tauopathy. LD-MG are observed in actively degenerating brain regions in a tauopathy mouse model, but the
functions of these cells in the disease process are not currently known. To begin addressing this question, we
will use FACS coupled with scRNAseq to characterize any transcriptional differences between LDhigh vs LDlow
microglia isolated from 9.5 month old tauopathy mice. Given recent evidence suggesting that the LD-MG
observed in aged mice have pro-inflammatory, hypo-phagocytic phenotypes, we hypothesize that the LD-MG
in our tauopathy model will have similar pathway alterations and could thus be partially responsible for
microglial contributions to neurodegeneration. To assess the relevance of these findings to humans, we will
stain postmortem human AD brain samples for any promising mouse LD-MG markers. To elucidate the
functional roles of LD-MG in the progression of tauopathy, we will utilize a new mouse model that allows for the
inducible, microglial-specific knockout of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes, which have been
demonstrated to be required for LD biogenesis in multiple biological contexts. A substantial amount of literature
supports a role for lipid droplets in sequestering potentially toxic lipids and we hypothesize that crippling the
ability of MG to form LDs via DGAT KO will accelerate tauopathy progression, which we will assess using a
combination of immunohistochemical, scRNAseq, and lipidomic analyses. Our studies will characterize an
understudied subset of microglia, increase our knowledge of the diversity of myeloid functional states, and
evaluate the potential of modulating microglial lipid metabolism for the treatment of Alzheimer disease."

Healthcare quality is impacted by structure and organization. Approximately 6 million Americans are admitted
to an intensive care unit (ICU) yearly and many require mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure.
Understanding optimal ICU organization is essential to ensure high quality care is delivered to these, our
sickest patients. Over the past 20 years as the number of US ICU beds and the complexity of care provided
has increased dramatically, intensivists (physicians trained specifically in critical care) working with
interprofessional ICU teams (including nurses, respiratory therapists, clinical pharmacists, etc.) have become
the norm in many ICUs. Studies highlight the positive impact of having an intensivist care for critically ill
patients; for this reason, the Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends “high intensity intensivist staffing”.
Similarly, the positive impact of a multidisciplinary team on patient outcomes is well established. What is not
known, however, is how ICU care providers impact patient care in the context of team structure and workload.
Our recent work in the United Kingdom suggests there is a significant relationship between the number of
patients each intensivist cares for and their patients’ mortality; whether this relationship is the same in the US
and how it is affected by other ICU care providers is unknown. Finally, since a landmark study in 2000
highlighted the gap between intensivist demand and supply in the US, it has become clear that updated ICU
workforce projections are needed to aid in resource planning; however, these will fail if they are limited by
“siloing” (e.g., projecting intensivist need without considering the mitigating effect of other care providers) and
an underappreciation of how optimal staffing structures may differ from what is in use today. In this study we
will use primary surveys linked with existing patient- level data across multiple US ICUs and a novel
methodology of System Dynamics Modeling to address 3 aims: (1) determine detailed staffing models currently
used across the US; (2) quantify the association of patient-to-care provider ratio with patient outcomes across
selected ICUs; and (3) estimate current and future ICU workforce need. This project will yield critical insights
into the best staffing models for ICU care delivery and how resources must be allocated in the future to close
ICU care provider gaps. While focused on ICU care, this project will create a replicable framework for (1)
quantifying provider workload by daily patient census in light of other staffing availability and (2) using System
Dynamics Modeling to simulate workforce supply and demand which will be useful to plan for any aspect of
healthcare. We will provide clinicians and policy makers with key information on ICU staffing to improve patient
safety."

The mission of the proposed G-RISE Program is to increase the number of PhDs
underrepresented in the diverse fields of Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience and
Psychology who will proceed to postdoctoral research fellowships/positions, on a
trajectory to enter the biomedical/behavioral research workforce. To accomplish this
goal, our main program objectives are: 1) to foster in each trainee: self-efficacy in their
chosen specialty, self-identification as a research scientist, and the confidence that they
are integral, contributing members of their scientific community; 2) to develop our
trainees’ technical and professional skills required to conduct research in an ethically
responsible and rigorous manner; 3) to develop our trainees’ didactic, research,
mentoring, and career development skills; 4) to promote our trainees’ timely fulfillment
of the institutional requirements for the Ph.D.; 5) to foster and facilitate each trainee’s
appointment to a postdoctoral position in preparation for entering the
biomedical/behavioral research workforce in their specialty. The rationale for the
current G-RISE proposal is to build on the success of our current IMSD Program (24
PhDs in the last 3 grant cycles and 5 more expected this year) and take the opportunity
to develop programmatic innovations within the G-RISE format. The following key
activities comprise part of the design of the proposed G-RISE Program: 1) Research
Communication Workshop to develop the trainees’ skills in communicating their
scientific research to a multidisciplinary audience, 2) Fellowship Writing Workshop to
foster a knowledge base to develop a fellowship application, 3) Research Career
Preparation seminar series and 4) Responsible Conduct of Research and Research
Reproducibility seminar series. A mentor-training component is included in the proposed
G-RISE program with a healthy balance between established and early career
investigators. The proposed program measurable outcomes are: 1) Earning the PhD
degree; 2) Applying for at least one predoctoral fellowship, 3) Successfully vying for a
postdoctoral research fellowship/position by the completion of the doctorate. Taken
together, the proposed G-RISE Program will continue the development of a successful
training program aimed at fostering the entrance of the trainees into fields of
behavioral/biomedical research in which they have been traditionally underrepresented."
10799593,"The neural system underlying conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is, like all systems underlying perceptual
learning, highly complex—learning-relevant regions, most notably including basolateral amygdala (BLA)
and gustatory cortex (GC), work together to make learning happen. While most research to date has
focused on the role of each individual region in learning, rather than their influence on each other, my lab’s
work is a direct investigation of inter-neuronal and inter-regional interactions during taste learning. This
work has demonstrated that the coupling between BLA and GC taste responses is important for both basic
taste processing and for CTA learning: blocking transmission in the BLAàGC pathway interferes with the
coherent emergence of palatability-related information in GC ensemble taste codes (information that
appears relatively late in GC responses), and keeps learning from happening; it is therefore reasonable to
propose that activity in BLAàGC axons is vital for learning-related plasticity in those GC ensemble
responses—that is, in the changes to late-appearing palatability-related coding. The experiments proposed
here will build upon this foundation, and on recent work by collaborators, to test this overarching
hypothesis. First we will acutely and selectively silence BLAàGC axons, and test whether this perturbation
blocks learning- and behavior-linked changes in GC population responses. We will then test whether
recently-identified learning-related transcription changes occurring in BLAàGC projection neurons are
necessary for the induction and maintenance of GC taste response plasticity caused by CTA. Finally, we
will test whether intrinsic excitability in the connection between BLA and GC—which appears to be
increased in mice that fail to learn, and decreased in projection neurons that are involved in learning—is
the parameter controlling learning-related changes in GC network activity. Together, these experiments
will be the first to directly and specifically relate cellular/molecular plasticity processes to the emergent
dynamics of network function in vertebrates. In the process, they will reveal new facets of the neural
mechanisms of a more general experiential phenomenon that affects (sometimes adversely) all mammals
including humans."
10611906,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Although aggressive treatments have
improved outcomes, many patients still die of their disease, and survivors suffer severe long-term side effects
from the therapy. Thus, safer and more effective approaches to therapy are critical. In our previous studies we
have created new animal models of medulloblastoma and used them to define cells of origin, identify key
regulators of tumor initiation and maintenance, and uncover agents that may be effective for therapy of the
disease. Although we have made important strides over the last few years, there are a number of critical
questions that remain unanswered. In the coming years, we will take advantage of the models and approaches
we have developed to: (1) Identify drivers and create models for the deadliest forms of medulloblastoma; (2)
Uncover the molecular mechanisms of leptomeningeal metastasis, and find novel strategies for targeting
metastatic disease; (3) Use primary patient tumors as a platform to discover new therapies; and (4) Identify
mechanisms that regulate immune responses to medulloblastoma. The overall goal of our research is to gain a
deeper understanding of medulloblastoma biology and use this information to develop more effective approaches
to therapy. Although these studies are ambitious, they are essential if we are to make a difference in the lives of
children with this devastating disease."
10833647,"Project Summary/Abstract
Background:
The primary epithelial stem cell in the intestine has been known for over a decade, leading to important
observations in epithelial renewal and injury recovery. These fundamental studies have demonstrated that the
intestinal epithelium is a balanced continuum between stemness in the crypt base and differentiation towards
the mucosal surface, with complex signaling networks influencing stemness and fate of the differentiating
progenitor cells. Several groups have now shown that destruction of intestinal stem cells and/or extensive
epithelial damage can be repaired by the dedifferentiation of progenitor cells. Thus, the balance between
stemness and differentiation can be tipped by as yet undefined molecular mechanisms.
We discovered that the nuclear receptor Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1; NR5A2) is essential for both
stem cell maintenance and for directing differentiation of the highly specialized enteroendocrine cell lineage.
Therefore, this unusual transcription factor has dual roles promoting stemness and cell differentiation, making it
an attractive target for elucidating the mechanisms responsible for gut epithelial renewal and healing.
Approach:
In this application, we will 1) determine the contribution of LRH-1 to epithelial repair and stem cell restitution in
enteritis models, 2) determine how SUMOylation of LRH-1 modulates receptor function in stem and progenitor
cells, and 3) determine and validate the cell-specific gut LRH-1 “targetome.” We will accomplish this through
the use of lineage-traced mouse models and novel implementations of the intestinal organoid platform.
Following successful completion of our aims, we will have mechanistically evaluated the contribution of a
druggable nuclear receptor to 1) balancing stem cell renewal, differentiation, and restitution of damaged
epithelium 2) provided the first ever detailed evaluation of SUMOylated LRH-1 in the gut, and 3) generated a
bona fide LRH-1 gut targetome that will be invaluable for receptor drug development.
Goals:
This proposal is designed to expand upon a key finding uncovered during my funded K08 investigation and
advance our mechanistic understanding of how the gut balances stemness vs differentiation during normal and
diseased states. Underlying this work is our hypothesis that LRH-1 is differentially modulated within unique
cellular contexts in stem and progenitor cells to drive diverse gene programs simultaneously supporting cell
renewal and specialized cell differentiation. Our experiments are designed to maximally exploit the
extraordinary confluence of intestinal epithelial physiology and nuclear receptor biology framed by LRH-1."
10811778,"Project Summary:
The perception of speech and language requires normal functioning of the auditory cortex
(ACX). How ACX does this critically depends on the coordinated activity of populations of
neurons: both across the cortex and throughout its multi-layered structure. The primary auditory
cortex (A1) plays a key role for sound perception since it represents one of the first cortical
processing stations. Recent results have shown that neural activity of A1 neurons depend not
only on auditory stimuli themselves, but are influenced by the history of sounds, internal state,
and behavioral context of the animal. For example, the selectivity of individual A1 neurons can
rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, or when
listening conditions become more challenging. However, behaviorally relevant information is
encoded in populations of neurons but to date it is not understood how behavioral influences
shape the activity across A1 neural populations, and how the resulting population activity relates
to task performance. Here we determine how sounds are dynamically encoded in diverse cell
populations during behavior and the changing nature of their cellular interactions within and
across A1 layers.
 By using in vivo 2-photon imaging in behaving mice we will determine the functional
responses to complex stimuli in identified large populations of A1 neurons, how these neurons
interact, reconstruct the functional networks present with A1, and shared external influences on
these A1 networks. We then investigate how A1 networks change their responses and
functional interactions during auditory behaviors of varying task difficulty. Thus, we determine
how network changes depend on the identify and the difficulty of a task. Together, these
experiments will reveal how A1 networks are dynamically reconfigured depending on the
behavioral needs of the animal. Our prior work identified a region of the frontal cortex, the
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), as a source of inputs to A1 that can change A1 receptive fields. We
thus investigate how OFC projections are engaged during auditory behaviors and if
manipulating OFC projections to A1 will alter behavioral performance.
 Our work contributes to the mechanistic understanding of the ability of normal-hearing
listeners to navigate complex or noisy acoustic environments and shift their attention between
different sound sources. Thus, our work contributes to the understanding of diverse conditions
such as tinnitus, aging, dyslexia, central auditory processing disorder (CAPD)."
10815776,"Project Summary
A significant obstacle to the creation of the next generation of small molecule therapeutics is the lack of general
and efficient methods for accessing certain stereochemically dense structures that contain functionality
important for bioactivity. This application seeks to continue a productive MIRA program concerned with the
laboratory preparation of chiral, functionalized bioactive small molecule building blocks. The general goal of
this program is to develop new synthetic chemistry platforms that will enable the rapid and selective
construction of new structures of immediate relevance for biomedical applications.
Key challenges that we seek to address in the coming project period include:
 • Enantioconvergent reactions: A significant expansion of general strategies and reaction platforms that
 catalytically convert readily accessible racemic starting materials into high value, enantiomerically
 enriched products;
 • Salt-based catalysis: The development of broad new catalysis modes that operate by quasi-
 intramolecular mechanisms enabled by ionic tethering;
 • Dearomatization of feedstock arenes: The development of useful oxidative dearomatization reactions
 that convert readily available aromatic building blocks into functionalized enantiomerically pure building
blocks;
 • Natural product synthesis: The efficient synthesis and biological evaluation of complex natural products
 and new structural analogs.
Collectively, we expect that these MIRA research activities will provide facile access to structures that were
heretofore unknown or accessible only by virtue of methods that were inefficient and/or impractical. The
program generates new chemical knowledge in the form of new reactions and catalysts for use by the scientific
community, and also provides new chemical matter for us to study with our biological collaborators on problems
of biomedical relevance."
10828741,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose to develop peptide ligands that bind to membrane receptors known to malfunction
in maladies such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. Our preliminary data indicate that we
have designed several peptide ligands that can activate or inhibit different receptors. The basis
of the efficacy of the peptides is that interactions between transmembrane (TM) domains is
critical for receptor function. These peptides are intended to bind to the TM domain of their
target to revert defective receptor activity. Membrane insertion of the peptides is controllable, as
they are triggered by environmental acidity. We will also develop a new generation of peptides
where membrane insertion is triggered by an array of different stimuli. This would provide
means of targeting the peptides to the desired tissues.
To improve our ability to study the interactions between TM domains, we will develop a new
single-molecule method that allows us to obtain stoichiometric and thermodynamic information.
These studies will be complemented with investigation of how TM domains influence lipid
dynamics. In addition to the development of these peptide ligands, we will perform systematic
analyses to understand the molecular mechanism by which similar peptides can activate or
inhibit membrane receptors. Through this work we seek to provide promising new therapeutic
approaches and invaluable functional knowledge of how peptide ligands can modulate disease-
causing membrane receptors."
10839292,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most fatal hematologic malignancy in adults, largely due to high rates of
relapse following chemotherapy. Residual disease, the persistence of immunophenotypically, morphologically,
or genetically defined leukemia cells following frontline chemotherapy, is a poor prognostic factor for AML.
Residual AML cells have been shown to localize to endosteal bone marrow regions in murine models, where
they may utilize microanatomical niches specialized to support long-term quiescent hematopoietic stem cells to
become dormant and gain resistance to chemotherapy, which targets dividing cells. However, these niches are
ill-defined in human bone marrow, and it remains unclear whether human AML cells actually interact with
canonical stem cell niches as a mechanism to evade chemotherapy. Our central hypothesis is that AML cells
interact with cells in protective niches within bone marrow by overexpressing stem cell niche retention
receptors, which allows them to acquire chemoresistance. In Aim 1, we will employ Co-Indexing by Epitopes
(CODEX), a recently developed method to visualize dozens of antibody markers on a single-cell level from
fixed human tissue, to dissect the exact composition and spatial organization of human bone marrow niches.
For the first time, we will be able to determine where chemoresistant cells localize in clinical bone marrow
biopsies from AML patients. We will assess whether or not non-dividing residual AML cells localize
preferentially to endosteal stem cell niches in the bone marrow in response to chemotherapy. In Aim 2, we will
determine whether stem cell niche retention receptors are overexpressed on residual AML cells and promote
chemoresistance. To achieve this, in Aim 2A we will first perform single-cell RNA sequencing of AML bone
marrow aspirate samples from diagnosis and time of residual disease determination, as well as healthy
controls, providing an expression profile of AML cells, AML-associated microenvironmental cells, and their
healthy counterparts. We will determine whether receptors mediating niche retention are overexpressed. In
Aim 2B, we will assess whether they are functionally important for chemoresistance using CRISPR-Cas9
mediated knockout of overexpressed receptor-ligand pairs which mediate AML-stromal interaction in an AML-
stormal co-culture system that will be treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. If AML cells indeed localize to these
endosteal niches and gain chemoresistance through receptor-ligand mediated interaction in the stem cell
niche, these receptor/ligand pairs would represent an attractive target for chemosensitization, which may help
reduce AML relapse risk. Together, this project is poised to evaluate whether leukemic cells hijack healthy
stem cell niches to evade standard-of-care chemotherapy, and this work has the potential to reveal new
therapeutic opportunities to better treat this deadly disease."
10833587,"We work to determine the fundamental principles underlying the operation of molecular machines that give cells the
remarkable ability to segregate their chromosomes during cell division. Various force-sensitive interactions are essential
for mitotic fidelity, and are therefore critical to our understanding of aneuploidy and genomic instability. Over the last 5
years, we have developed molecular tools, equipment, and expertise to quantitatively and rigorously address central
questions about the role of force in chromosome segregation: (1) How do the macromolecular complexes that constitute
human kinetochores travel with dynamic microtubule ends under load? (2) How do individual microtubule-associated
proteins with no motor activity glide along microtubules under dragging force? (3) How does tension applied to the
centromeric chromatin meshwork shape the spatial phosphorylation gradients that orchestrate assembly of the
kinetochores and their binding to microtubules? We approach these problems using reductionist approaches and
innovative in vitro assays that reconstruct these interactions at multiple scales, and analyze our findings with advanced
theoretical modeling. (1) To recreate force-sensitive interactions between microtubules and human kinetochores, we
developed a novel approach for generating macromolecular kinetochore subcomplexes using inducible protein-fusion
scaffolds. When isolated from mitotic HeLa cells, these particles exhibit key physiological properties of native
kinetochores, including their persistent association with dynamic microtubule ends. This breakthrough will enable us for
the first time to study the motility of native human kinetochore complexes, driving forward our biophysical analysis of
kinetochore load-bearing. (2) We will investigate the force sensitivity of individual microtubule-binding proteins at the
single-molecule and ensemble levels using an advanced force spectroscopy approach. We have implemented a highly
sensitive dual-trap, three-bead assay employing an ultrafast force-clamp that allows us to pull on a single non-motor
molecule diffusing on the microtubule wall, imitating the forces these kinetochore-bound molecules experience during
chromosome motions. This approach will provide unique molecular-mechanical insights into the friction-generating
interface that allows the kinetochore to glide along microtubule, while preventing it from slipping from microtubule ends.
(3) We will seek to understand how mechanical deformations shape chemical gradients formed within the chemo-
mechanical meshworks, such as of the centromeric chromatin. Previously, we reconstructed a non-linear Aurora B
kinase/phosphatase bi-stable switch using soluble components. In a proof-of-principle study, we will embed these
enzymatic components into a flexible meshwork to test whether its deformations can control formation of distinct
phosphorylation patterns. Spatio-temporal regulation of the phosphorylation status of kinetochore proteins is central to
the error correction mechanism of microtubule attachment. Hence, our findings will provide new knowledge about this
fundamental process, and facilitate new discoveries about complex chemo-mechanical systems."
10802432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart transplantation is the only cure for end-stage heart disease; however, an increasing imbalance between
demand and supply has limited access to this life-saving procedure. Extending the length of time hearts can
remain alive during transport represents a critical enabling technology to address several limitations in heart
transplantation. For example, usable hearts are discarded due to circumstantial factors, such as the timing of
donor death and donor/recipient location, which can be eliminated by extended preservation. Further, longer
preservation duration has the potential to improve recipient outcomes by enhancing donor-recipient matching,
reducing ischemic injury, and removing the risk of emergency surgeries. Consequently, this project aims to
develop a new method to extend preservation of hearts for transplantation from 4-6 hours to 3+ days.
While we have mastered the preservation of several clinically relevant cell types in suspension, solid organs
have been met with limited success since different cell types have different responses to the same injury.
Further, high throughput experimental methods to aid development of preservation solutions are limited since
intact tissue has 3D structural considerations that have a profound effect on successful preservation and
commonly used in vitro cell models are not representative and lack assessment of functional outcomes.
Instead, we propose to strategically leverage zebrafish transgenic lines to address cell-specific responses,
functional consequences, and compounding injuries of preservation approaches with an intact, native heart in
a high throughout format. Approaches developed in zebrafish will be rapidly scaled to mammalian hearts to
promote translation.
We will leverage this experimental platform to enable the development of a new preservation approach, termed
partial freezing. Inspired by freeze-tolerant wood frogs in nature, partial freezing aims to maximize storage
durations by entering unexplored high subzero temperatures ranges approaching -20°C. To enter these
temperature ranges, we will develop effective strategies for hearts to live in the presence of ice. This will be
achieved through the development of a storage solution designed to protect diverse cardiac cell types without
adverse functional consequences (Specific Aim 1). These efforts will be complimented by the discovery of
inducers that activate hypoxia signaling (Specific Aim 2) and the unfolded protein response (Specific Aim 3) to
rescue hearts from ischemic and temperature-dependent injury, respectively. These inducers will be combined
into a preconditioning solution that is delivered during machine perfusion to further extend preservation time."
10792469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although infertility affects 10% of women between the ages of 15 and 44 in the United States, fundamental gaps
in knowledge surround ovary development. Ovarian folliculogenesis, defined as the production of mature and
competent oocytes for ovulation, is a highly organized process that is critical for fertility. In mammals, the ‘ovarian
reserve’ is comprised of single immature oocytes surrounded by a layer of somatic cells. This unit, known as a
primordial follicle, remains non-growing until it activates and transitions through morphologically distinct stages
of growth to support oocyte maturation. Follicle maturation occurs twice in mammalian life during separate waves
of growth: first, around birth and second, at the onset of puberty. Distinct from the 2nd wave, which is initiated by
release of gonadotropin hormone at puberty, the mechanisms underlying how 1st wave follicles are chosen to
mature during this gonadotropin-independent wave remain elusive.
As evidence indicates that sympathetic innervation may be involved in 1st wave follicle maturation, I propose
to define the role and branching dynamics of sympathetic nerves (SNs) in the 1st wave of
folliculogenesis. The overall hypothesis is that SNs innervate growing follicles via both autocrine and paracrine
signaling and function to prime 1st wave follicles for gonadotropin-control. Elucidating how SNs influence female
reproductive maturation and the mechanisms critical for establishing SN networks during the 1st wave of
folliculogenesis will glean critical insights into the basic biology of this essential process and provide a platform
for understanding ovarian disease pathogenesis. Leveraging innovative mouse genetics, whole organ clearing,
3D imaging, and quantitative analysis approaches, this proposal will: first, generate a 3D spatiotemporal map of
SNs during 1st wave follicle maturation in the neonatal ovary; second, investigate the function of SNs in the 1st
wave of follicle maturation; and third, interrogate the role of non-canonical Wnt-Ror1/2 signaling in the branching
dynamics of SNs during the 1st wave of folliculogenesis. Sponsor Dr. Laird and co-sponsor Dr. Knox have
complementary expertise in the fields of reproductive biology, genetic mouse models, 3D whole organ imaging
and analysis, organogenesis, and peripheral nerve biology. Their collective expertise alongside the F31
Fellowship support assures the training and mentorship necessary to complete the proposed research."
10786125,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research and experimental use of pluripotent stem cells has expanded rapidly, and these cells now provide
important research models of human disease and personalized regenerative medicine. However, the majority of
research to date that has utilized stem cells has employed genetically-limited murine cells or clonal human cell
lines with little attention paid to the impact of cellular genetic diversity on the phenotypic and functional outcomes
and its relevance to human diversity. Importantly, recent data from murine and human studies of pluripotent stem
cells indicate that genetic variability is the most significant driver of molecular and cellular differences in
phenotype, including the ease of establishment of pluripotent cell lines, the rate of spontaneous differentiation,
reprogramming differentiated cells to a pluripotent state, and the future use of stem cells as personalized
therapeutics. Thus, there is now an unmet need, not rigorously addressed at current conferences, to understand
the consequences of genetic variation on stem cell biology and their impact on development. To fill this gap, we
propose the unique and timely conference “Diversity in a Dish: Pluripotent Stem Cells in Genetic Analysis and
Disease Modeling” to facilitate interdisciplinary interactions and collaborations between experts in mouse and
human genetics, cell biology, and pluripotency, and to engage diverse learners who are the next generation of
stem cell researchers. We propose an annual, intensive 3-day conference beginning in 2023 at The Jackson
Laboratory in Bar Harbor, ME. We will bring together 50 scientists, spanning career stages, from the fields of
genetics, cell biology, and pluripotency, as well as provide a virtual attendance option for those that cannot or
choose not to attend in person. For Aim 1, we will convene an interdisciplinary symposium organized around
cutting-edge research seminars, workshops that focus on technical skill acquisition, and rigor and reproducibility
as applied to stem cell research and genomic analyses. In Aim 2, we will promote interactive and inclusive
activities, to promote networking, mentorship, learner involvement, collaborative research, and career
development. These activities include trainee presentations and short talks, and evening discussions focused
on research projects, rigor and ethics, and grantsmanship. These objectives are facilitated by the residential
nature of the JAX Highseas Conference Center. In Aim 3, we will promote diversity in both the recruitment of
participants and in the tools being generated to study models of human disease. Diverse attendees will be
actively recruited, scholarships will be provided to enable in-person attendance, and an inclusive virtual option
will enable participation by those that are unable to travel. Diversity will also be emphasized in the context of
best practices for research, including the need for studies of genetically diverse panels of stem cells, and fair
acquisition, representation, and distribution of cell lines from wider representation of backgrounds to ensure the
benefits discovered from these biomedical resources are shared equitably."
10812433,"Project Summary
Gene regulatory programs of mammalian cells are largely influenced by long-range
chromatin interactions. We propose to develop robust and scalable statistical methods
for two critical genomic inference problems hinging upon long-range chromatin
interactions. First, the study of long-range interactions at the single cell-level with 3C-
based method scHi-C is fundamental to fully understanding cell type-specific gene
regulation. scHi-C measurements harbor unexplored biological diversity. However, these
measurements are prone to extreme sparsity, technological bias, and noise. While initial
inference methods simply focused on lower dimensional representations of scHi-C data,
lack of a scalable framework that can exploit nonlinearities in de-noising of the data
impedes key inference tasks from these experiments. We will address these critical
shortcomings by developing a novel deep generative model for scHi-C data. By de-
noising the data, these methods will improve the power with which signals of interest can
be studied. Second, while advances in sequencing and large-scale availability of
epigenome data improved the power and interpretation of genome-wide association
studies (GWAS), shortcomings in identifying which genes noncoding SNPs might be
impacting through long-range chromatin interactions hinder the translation of GWAS
findings into clinical interventions. Leveraging existing large-scale studies of diversity
outbred mice, we will develop a rigorous framework that integrates multi-omics functional
data modalities to fine-map model organism molecular quantitative trait loci and transfer
the results to humans for linking noncoding GWAS SNPs to their effector, i.e.,
susceptibility, genes. Large-scale application with type 2 diabetes (T2D) traits will deliver
candidate T2D effector genes and their regulatory loci that are amenable for
experimental follow-up. Both aims will be accomplished through a combination of
methodological development, theoretical analysis, data-driven simulation, computational
analysis, and experimental validation. Statistical resources generated from this project
will be disseminated as open-source software. Successful completion of the project will
help to ensure that maximal information is obtained from powerful scHi-C experiments
and model organism multi-omics data."
10829400,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Population history shapes human biology, genetic variation, and disease risk. Despite its importance, analytical
methods to study history on a genome-wide scale are limited in both their resolution and qualitative ability to
reconstruct aspects of the past. This makes it a priority to develop new methods that are able to model the
major population mixture events that have been documented as a result of the genomic and ancient DNA data
revolutions in the last decade. At present, the world's ancient DNA data suffer from major technical biases that
are not properly controlled for, the analytical toolkit for studying population mixture with modern and ancient
DNA is inadequate, and we are only beginning to develop methods that realize the potential of ancient DNA to
reveal as much about biology as about history. This proposal aims to address these needs by extending
funding for grant R01 GM100233, which from 2012-2020 supported the PIs' central research program on
developing methods for studying human population history and leveraging this information to learn about
biology, resulting in 70 publications linked to the grant. We propose three new Aims:
 (1) To create an unbiased pipeline for processing ancient DNA, and to use it reanalyze the world's data;
 (2) To extend the capabilities of admixture graphs for population history inference;
 (3) To introduce new tools for analyzing population history and biology.
 This grant will be of value in four ways. (a) It will support the development of methods and user-friendly
and well-documented software that will be important for evolutionary and medical genetics. (b) It will support
work that will result in insights relevant to finding disease genes in human populations that are recently or
anciently admixed. (c) It will lead to new discoveries about human history. (d) It will produce a publicly available
reprocessed version of the world's ancient DNA data that will be of broad use to the community.
 The link to medical genetics is important. In the past, we have been successful at drawing a direct
connection between our laboratory's work on detecting and characterizing population mixture, and human
biology including genetic susceptibility to disease. We leveraged the history of admixture in African Americans
to make new disease gene discoveries (for example, risk factors for prostate cancer), to understand variation
in disease risk across populations, and to document differences in the biology of recombination between
African Americans and people who do not have West African ancestry, which are predicted to lead to different
levels of risk for diseases associated with errors in recombination. Our focus on drawing connections between
population history and disease risk also highlighted the opportunities for discovery of recessive disease genes
in thousands of founder groups in South Asia. We anticipate that the methods and resources we develop with
the support of this grant will continue to synergize with the latest research on human variation and disease risk."
10789929,"The traditional structure-function paradigm has provided significant insights for well-folded proteins in which
structures can be easily and rapidly revealed by X-ray crystallography beamlines and NMR. However
approximately one third of the human proteome are comprised of intrinsically disordered proteins and regions
that do not adopt a dominant well-folded structure, and therefore remain “unseen” by traditional structural
biology methods. Current experimental and computational approaches to structural descriptions of disordered
proteins, while often valuable, still lack predictive power, particularly for dynamic complexes of IDPs, as well as
lack of insight into the relationships between IDP structural ensembles and function. We made significant
progress in the last grant cycle in the following four directions: (1) Generating and quantifying the utility of
experimental data types for IDP monomer ensembles; (2) Applying atomistic and coarse-grained physical
models and machine learned sampling methods for generating monomer ensembles; (3) Advancing new
Bayesian models for IDP monomer ensemble selection; (4) development of highly novel machine learning (ML)
methodology for ensemble generation and selection; (5) Creating software and monomer ensemble data and
placing them in the hands of practitioners. Many of these results serve as preliminary studies for this renewal
and are described in more detail in proposed research. But to fully address the biological activity of IDPs we
propose to adapt these computational methods further and develop new integrative biology tools that will be
more selective for dynamic associations of IDPs within both discrete dynamic complexes and biological
condensates and for post-translational modifications (PTMs) that create relevant IDP functional states. Building
on strong preliminary data from our experimental collaborators, we will record NMR, SAXS and single molecule
fluorescence data on phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated 4E-binding protein 2 (np-4E-BP2, 5p-4E-BP2)
and its dynamic complex with the eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF4E); tropoelastin and mixed and
condensed-phase elastin fragments; and mixed and condensed-phase CAPRIN1 C-terminal IDR, including novel
NMR experiments that probe electrostatic potentials (ESPs), 3-color smFRET, and fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS). These studies will illuminate mechanisms of translational regulation and elasticity, and
provide insights into pathological states, including autism spectrum disorder and cardiovascular disease."
10786058,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The steady erosion of cognitive function is a hallmark of aging and markedly exacerbated in Alzheimer Disease
(AD). These deficits have no effective treatments. Depletion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and
reduction of NAD+-dependent sirtuin activity in aging and AD have been well documented. Restoring NAD+ or
activating the sirtuin SIRT1 has induced abatement of aging symptoms including cognitive decline. However,
current NAD+ replenishment strategies are non-specific and the success of SIRT1 activation as an anti-aging
therapeutic may require tissue-specific activation and the concomitant restoration of NAD+. We have shown
previously that nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme in the major
mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis pathway, is contained in extracellular vesicles (EVs) and secreted to plasma.
Treatment of aged mice with plasma-derived EVs containing extracellular NAMPT (eNAMPT) extends mouse
lifespan and healthspan. Our preliminary data suggest that EV treatment can ameliorate cognitive dysfunction
and rescue age-related decreases in hippocampal CA1 synapse counts in 24-month-old mice. EVs are also
targeted to the brain and can increase NAD+ in cultured neurons. However, the tissue-specific EV targeting
mechanism as well as the implications for EV treatment in the context of AD-related cognitive decline remain
unknown. This study will test the hypothesis that EV-contained eNAMPT rescues age-related cognitive
dysfunction via activating SIRT1 in key neuronal populations and that leveraging this pathway can lessen AD-
associated cognitive decline. In Aim 1, cell culture-derived EVs will be utilized to test the necessity of eNAMPT
in the targeting and uptake of EVs both in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, the possibility that the cognitive benefits of
EV treatment occur through eNAMPT-mediated activation of SIRT1 will be evaluated. This determination will
be accomplished via EV treatment with and without EV-contained eNAMPT and with and without hippocampal
knockdown of Sirt1 by viral delivery of shRNA. Aim 3 will test the effectiveness of EVs in treating cognitive
deficits and pathological progression in a mouse model of AD. Therefore, this study has the potential to
elucidate a novel role for eNAMPT in facilitating both the cellular targeting of EVs and the efficacy of EVs in
rescuing age- and AD-related cognitive dysfunction. This project may also establish eNAMPT-containing EVs
as a viable biologic to treat cognitive deterioration in aging and AD. This fellowship proposal integrates the
NAD+ biology and aging expertise of sponsor Dr. Shin Imai with comprehensive training in behavioral
neuroscience, AD models, advanced synaptic analysis, EV engineering, and laboratory mentorship and
leadership. This training will be further empowered by the intellectually stimulating and highly collaborative
environment of Washington University in St. Louis. Thus, this fellowship will constitute ideal preparation for the
applicant’s career as the future leader of an academic laboratory."

Chromosome segregation errors such as persistent DNA bridges accelerate genome instability, a hallmark of
cancer. These toxic DNA lesions occur at a higher frequency in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC)
cells with DNA repair deficiencies, and thus defective genome maintenance. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) cause
targeted tumor cell death in BRCA-mutant HBOC and have been suggested to further increase the frequency of
DNA bridges in cultured BRCA-mutant cells. Despite the therapeutic promise of PARPi, BRCA-deficient cancers
develop acquired resistance to this therapy. Recent studies show that immunotherapies can prevent or delay
PARPi resistance in HBOC tumors; however, the mechanisms by which PARPi synergizes with immunotherapies
remain poorly defined. My preliminary data shows that PARPi treatment leads to coating of persistent DNA
bridges with the innate immune DNA sensor cGAS in BRCA-mutant cells, which coincides with increased type I
interferon signaling. I hypothesize that PARPi-induced persistent DNA bridges are central to the mechanism of
PARPi cytotoxicity and synergy with immunotherapies, therefore requiring rigorous further study to identify
strategies that maximize the therapeutic potential of PARPi treatment in DNA repair-deficient tumors. The
overall objective of this proposal is to thus define the mechanisms by which PARPi-induced persistent
DNA bridges lead to tumor-intrinsic immune activation in HBOC. The proposed research will investigate
this objective in two specific aims. Aim 1 will define the structure and nuclear integrity of PARPi-induced
persistent bridges by use of transposase-mediated fluorescence imaging, immunofluorescence, live-cell
imaging, and correlative light and electron microscopy. How these factors affect cGAS-STING activation will be
assessed using immunoblotting, RT-qPCR, and enzyme immunoassays. Aim 2 will establish persistent DNA
bridges and bulky anaphase bridges as potential predictive biomarkers that reflect DNA repair defects,
chromosome segregation failure, and subsequent cGAS-STING activation in PARPi olaparib-treated BRCA-
mutant breast cancer. I will leverage digital images of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained samples and perform
immunohistochemistry staining on a tissue microarray of de-identified, paired clinical samples before and during
olaparib treatment, which will be interrogated in the context of ongoing phospho-STING staining. Defining the
interplay between chromosomal instability-driven immune activation and tumor response to PARPi will be a first
step towards improved HBOC treatment. This proposal will be completed in a supportive, collaborative, and
interdisciplinary environment that will allow me to perform fundamental and translational cancer biology research.
This training will advance my experimental design, rigorous data analysis, and technical skills in molecular
biology, high-resolution microscopy, and cytopathology. My training plan also provides ample opportunities to
improve oral presentation, writing, teaching, and mentorship skills to prepare me for a successful career as an
academic cancer biologist leading a research group to mentor and train the next generation of scientists."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) extracts substantial medical, social, and economic costs, and compulsion-like
alcohol drinking (CLAD), where intake persists despite negative consequences, can be a particular obstacle to
treatment. Also concerning is that problem drinking in women has risen dramatically, and women can have
greater alcohol problems. However, mechanisms underlying sex differences remain poorly understood,
although anxiety-like states can strongly contribute to alcohol drinking, and women have greater prevalence of
mood disorders and AUD/anxiety comorbidity. Also, our rat studies suggest that females have greater
persistence in responding for alcohol, as well as greater anxiety-like responding. Thus, to help develop better,
personalized therapies, it is essential to understand sex differences and similarities in mechanisms underlying
excessive drinking and comorbidity with anxiety. Alcohol intake is likely driven by its salient motivational
properties, and anterior insula (aINS) is a critical regulator of responding to important situations and regulating
accompanying emotional states. We find that specific aINS projections (including aINS-Nucleus Accumbens,
NAcb) promote male CLAD, with little impact on alcohol-only drinking (AOD); in agreement, compulsion-like
responding for alcohol in women and men with AUD activates a similar aINS circuit. However, very little is
known about specific aINS mechanisms for alcohol drinking in females, or overcoming higher
challenge more generally. Also, global aINS inhibition reduces AOD, but the underlying aINS projection(s)
remain completely undiscovered. Here, we address the overarching hypothesis that different aINS circuits
drive CLAD vs AOD, and, especially, that particular aINS circuits mediate both CLAD and anxiety-like behavior
(ALB) in higher-anxiety individuals, which is especially cogent in females. Aim 1 uses projection-specific
optogenetic inhibition to examine particular aINS projections for AOD and CLAD: aINS-NAcb and aINS-
amygdala for CLAD, and aINS-posterior insula (pINS) for AOD. aINS-pINS projection is large, and pINS
inhibition decreases drinking, but aINS-pINS is nearly unstudied in rodent. Also, to best understand how aINS
outputs regulate behavior, it is critical to identify actual activity patterns within specific aINS projections. Thus,
Aim 2 uses cutting edge in vivo electrophysiology recording methods with “opto-tagging” to identify firing
patterns within specific aINS projections, especially predicted higher activity in females that underlies greater
persistence for alcohol. Finally, Aim 3 examines potential sex differences in the relation between ALB and
alcohol drinking, aINS encoding of these behaviors, and the impact of optogenetic inhibition of specific aINS
projections on both ALB and drinking. We predict that higher ALB rats will have greater aINS encoding of both
ALB and drinking, and greater optogenetic inhibition of ALB and intake, particularly in females. If successful,
we will discover key aINS projection mechanisms that drive AOD, CLAD, ALB, and their interrelations,
including important sex differences, which may open novel, sex-specific AUD treatments."
10747443,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Atrazine is the second most common agricultural herbicide used in the US and the most frequent agrichemical
contaminant in potable water supplies. Atrazine is regulated by the US EPA at 3 parts per billion (ppb; µg/L) in
drinking water, but concentrations above this regulatory limit are often reported. Laboratory and epidemiology
studies report various endocrine disrupting impacts with most focused along the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal
(HPG) axis acting through the suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) leading to decreased
luteinizing hormone (LH) release. However, there are several reports on atrazine altering additional endocrine
axes [including adrenal (HPA) and thyroid (HPT)] and neuronal functions and neurobehavior through multiple
neurotransmitter systems (including dopamine and serotonin). A hypothalamic atrazine toxicity target is
hypothesized but is yet to be identified. This target would need to be a master regulator of several hormones
and neuropeptides. We propose the kisspeptin system as this master regulator and will test the CENTRAL
HYPOTHESIS that dysregulation of the kisspeptin pathway by the neuroendocrine toxicant atrazine
connects observed impacts on developmental, reproductive, and neurobehavioral outcomes. Kisspeptin is
responsible for regulating GnRH neurons and subsequent LH release, which is the primary accepted mechanism of
atrazine endocrine disruption along the HPG axis. In addition, kisspeptin modulates the neurotransmitters dopamine
and serotonin regulating multiple neurobehaviors including locomotor and anxiety-related behavior, which are also
reported to be altered by atrazine exposure. Our studies in the zebrafish model system show that an embryonic
atrazine exposure at concentrations around the US EPA regulatory limit in drinking water impacts similar molecular
pathways (neuroendocrine, reproductive, neurotransmission, behavior) through transcript, protein, miRNA, and DNA
methylation analyses; endocrine axes (HPG, HPA, and HPA); neurotransmission systems (serotonin and dopamine);
behavior (locomotor and anxiety-related behavior); and functions (reproductive dysfunction) as identified in humans
and rodent models. The kisspeptin system is also conserved in zebrafish with two kiss genes (kiss1 and kiss2) present
for the mammalian KISS1 gene. The zebrafish presents as an excellent vertebrate model to address the kisspeptin
system, because kiss1 is primarily expressed in the ventral habenula regulating neurotransmission and associated
behavioral outcomes, while kiss2 is expressed in the hypothalamus with neurons projecting to the GnRH neurons.
As such, we can establish genetic mutants with CRISPR-Cas9 technology to investigate the specificity of these two
pathways in aim 1, along with determining the connections with key targets regulated by kisspeptin and altered by
atrazine exposure (e.g., GnRH, LH, dopamine, serotonin). In aim 2, we will then test the hypothesis that atrazine
developmental neurotoxicity on neuroendocrine and neurotransmission pathways is modulated through the
kisspeptin system. This project is novel in significantly advancing our knowledge on the role of kisspeptin as a master
regulator in atrazine toxicity pathways."
10796947,"Project Summary
Nervous system functions, including vision, arises from precise patterns of synaptic communication. In
neurodegenerative diseases, synapse loss can long precede cell death and predict functional impairments. We
recently discovered that the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) Netrin-G ligand 2 (NGL2) is required for the
maintenance of rod photoreceptor synapses throughout life and that viral delivery of NGL2 can restore synapse
numbers and induce the formation of extra synapses in adult wild-type and Ngl2 knockout mice, respectively.
Based on these findings, we hypothesized (1) that viral delivery of NGL2 may be able to rescue synapses in
inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs), a genetically heterogenous group of diseases in which photoreceptors
lose synapses and die causing visual impairments, including blindness. We also hypothesized (2) that NGL2-
mediated synapse rescue may be neuroprotective and slow photoreceptor death. Our preliminary data support
these hypotheses, which we further test in this proposal. In Aim 1, we will examine whether synapse loss and
photoreceptor degeneration progress differently IRD models on wild-type and Ngl2 KO backgrounds. We will
determine to what extent and at which time viral delivery of NGL2 can rescue synapses, protect photoreceptors,
and preserve vision. Finally, we will assess whether NGL2-gene therapy generalizes across IRD models that
differ in pathogenesis and disease progression. CAMs nucleate large protein complexes that control synapse
formation, maintenance, and function. The molecular composition and signaling mechanisms of these complexes
is mostly unknown. In Aim 2, we will analyze the composition of NGL2 complexes at photoreceptor synapses
and determine the contributions of NGL2’s interaction partners to synapse maintenance, rescue, and
neuroprotection. Many therapeutic approaches to neurodegeneration that succeed in mice are lost in translation
to humans. Differences in the anatomy, cellular composition, transcriptome, and function of neural circuits in
mice vs. humans contribute to this translational challenge. We have developed an organotypic culture system of
human retinas of patients undergoing enucleation surgery and organ donors. We have established an IRD model
in this system. In Aim 3, we use these advances to test the ability of NGL2 and its interaction partners to rescue
synapses and protect photoreceptors in the human retina. Together our studies will determine the potential of
CAM-gene therapy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Our mutation-agnostic approach could be
widely applicable for genetically heterogenous IRDs and may be adaptable to neurodegenerative disease in
other parts of the nervous system."
10821323,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) arise from B-cells transiting different stages of the germinal center
(GC) reaction. It has become clear that these tumors can co-opt regulatory circuits of normal B-cells to drive
their own malignant phenotype. Prior studies observe an inverse correlation between the timing of
transcriptional activation during reprogramming and the degree of topological reorganization near the gene
locus. This suggests that the reorganization of the 3D genome is critical for B-cell development and highlights
its importance in DLBCL. Regulatory hubs are highly interactive regions of enhancers that can form
interactions with multiple genes within topologically associating domains (TADs) to induce gene activation at a
higher probability than pairs of non-interacting genes within the same TAD. Hubs are often rewired during cell
fate transitions. Recent work also suggests a new level of organization into broadly interactive networks called
chromunities, which putatively allow for transboundary sharing of information and more extensive gene
regulatory information critical for cell identity. Critical to understanding the mechanisms driving changes in
gene networks is the study of how large-scale chromosomal rearrangements (structural variants, SVs) can co-
opt regulatory elements to form aberrant or de novo chromunities, consequently driving aberrant gene
expression. While the interpretation of complex structural variants (SVs) has focused primarily on gene
dosage and disruption by aberrant TAD structures, little is known regarding the role of SVs in reprogramming
regulatory hubs and their target genes. To investigate the role of chromunities and its associated hubs in cell
fate transitions and oncogenesis, we will leverage chromatin conformation capture interaction maps (pcHiC,
Pore-C) to develop a computational framework to nominate chromunities and map networks of enhancer and
promoters driving epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming. We will also integrate chromatin contact maps
with WGS data to investigate the role of complex SVs in reprogramming chromunities in lymphomas. Here, we
hypothesize that physiological reprogramming of chromunity regulatory elements creates de novo coordination
between sets of genes required to establish specific cell states and phenotypes during the humoral immune
response and that SVs occurring in DLBCL alter these hub structures or create new ones leading to selective
advantage of malignant clones. In our first aim, we will integrate transcriptional, epigenetic, and chromatin
conformation capture assays to identify chromunities and their regulatory elements associated with
establishing cell identity in the GC reaction. In our second aim, we will characterize the genomic
rearrangement landscapes of B-cell lymphomas and how these directly link to hubs and chromunities using
patient-derived xenograft models by generating matched WGS, Pore-C, and RNA-seq data."

Discovering and understanding novel pathological features that correlate with proteogenomics is crucial in
improving and streamlining cancer prognosis and treatment. Currently, biomedical research efforts to predict
cancer outcomes rely on sequencing approaches not readily accessible in a clinical setting. Instead, clinicians
frequently rely on histopathology images to visually assess for aberrant changes to tissue morphology.
Subsequently, a tool to infer clinical and molecular signatures directly from histopathology images would harness
the power of omics research with the feasibility of image-based diagnosis.
Histopathology imaging data is still vastly underutilized in the quest to better understand tumor biology, largely
because of inadequate tools for analysis and data integration. To identify pan-cancer hallmarks and conserved
pathways of tumorigenesis, I therefore propose to develop multi-resolution deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) models across 10 different cancer types and predict clinical annotations, histology outcomes, and critical
mutations based on tumor histopathology images (Aim 1). Through our lab’s collaboration with the National
Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), we have access to multi-omics,
clinical, and histopathologic data obtained from 1,602 patients. In addition, to understand the biological
mechanisms driving morphology changes, I propose to develop computational methods that integrate
transcriptomic and proteomic expression datasets with imaging to facilitate pathway-level knowledge discovery
(Aim 2). Our proposal is the first to correlate expression perturbations with morphology patterns and identify
enriched canonical pathways directly from histopathology images. Importantly, this proposal aims to connect
scientific efforts of biomedical research with the diagnostic tools of clinicians to expand diagnostic power and
improve clinical practice."

Recent largest GWAS identified HAVCR2 (TIM3) genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD).
Our laboratory discovered and cloned Tim3 as an inhibitory molecule that induces T cell exhaustion in cancer1.
Blocking antibodies to Tim3 are being approved for the treatment of cancer. However, we have now identified
that Tim3 is not only expressed on T cells, but also on myeloid cells and dendritic cells, where TIM3 restrains
dendritic cell function and regulate anti-tumor immunity2. In the CNS, HAVCR2 was identified as one of the top
100 enriched transcripts and is specifically expressed in both mouse and human microglia3-5, but its role and
function in microglia is unknown.
Our long-term goal is to define the role of TIM3 in regulation of microglia in neurodegeneration. We made the
following observations: 1) Tim3 inhibits microglial activation and phagocytosis: deletion of Tim3 in dendritic
cells boosted antigen presentation and we find that TIM3 also regulates microglial activation and phagocytosis;
2) TGFb-Tim3 axis regulates microglia phenotype switch in neurodegeneration: we find that TGFb is the key
driver for the induction of Tim3 and once expressed it synergizes with TGFBR to potentiate TGFB signaling, loss
of Tim3 switches M0-homeostatic microglia to an MGnD-nondegenerative phenotype; and 3) TIM3 deletion in
microglia reduces plaque burden in 5xFAD mice. These data support the genetic linkage studies and show the
importance of Tim3 in regulating disease pathology in AD by modulating microglial function. Based on these
studies, we hypothesize that TIM3 is a key regulatory molecule in microglia that inhibits their response
to neurodegeneration, migratory and phagocytic functions and thereby inhibit plaque clearance
resulting in promotion of Ab deposition, development, and progression of AD in aging brain. Based on
this hypothesis we have proposed three aims:
Aim 1: Define how TIM3 regulates phenotype and functions in 5xFAD and P301S mouse AD models. We
propose to study the effect of microglial deletion of Tim3 in neurodegeneration and brain tauopathy using the
mouse models of AD.
Aim 2: What is the role of TGFb signaling in the regulation of Tim3 expression and function in microglia
and development of AD? Since TGFb plays a critical role in maintenance of the homeostatic phenotype in
microglia, we propose to study how TGFb signaling induces Tim3 expression and promotes homeostatic
behavior of microglia by cooperating with TGFb receptor signaling.
Aim 3: Define the role of TIM3 in the regulation of human microglial function in AD. Determine how TIM3
impacts human iPSC-derived microglia activation and functions. We will examine whether genetic or
pharmacologic inhibition of TIM3 has a similar effect on iPSCs-derived human microglia expressing the MGnD
phenotype by utilizing a humanized chimeric mouse model of AD for treatment with human anti-Tim3 antibody
IN SUMMARY, targeting TIM3 in microglia may provide a novel approach for therapeutic modulation of innate
immunity in AD and dementia."

Sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent ?-thalassemia are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide, affecting ~400,000 newborns per year globally and shortening life expectancy by decades. Ongoing clinical trials have established the potential of genome editing as a curative strategy for these disorders. While promising, genome editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) currently requires resource-intensive ex vivo processes, limiting equitable access to a potentially curative intervention. Vectors for in vivo delivery of genome editors to HSPCs could circumvent this issue, but reported HSPC delivery systems are limited by vector immunogenicity, low editing efficiencies, and a lack of cell targeting specificity.  As a self-assembling, human-derived protein polymer amenable to facile incorporation of targeting domains, elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) have been established for nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery; however, an approach for ELP-mediated genome editor delivery has not been defined. The objective of the proposed work is to generate ELP nanoparticles for the delivery of mRNA-encoded genome editors to hematopoietic stem cells in vivo. In Aim 1, ELPs domain will be optimized for delivery of Cas9 mRNA and single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting housekeeping gene HPRT1. A library of ELPs will be screened to identify an optimal domain design for cargo complexation, release, and intracellular delivery in cell lines. In Aim 2, HSPC specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that enable in vitro genome editor delivery to HSPCs will be identified. Antibodies against markers enriched on murine HSPCs will be conjugated to ELP nanoparticles with varying valency to promote HSPC specific uptake. Cell-specific delivery of Cas9 will be evaluated in HSPCs isolated from Ai9-SauSpyCas9 mice, which enable fluorescent detection of editing activity. In Aim 3, the utility of mAb-labeled ELP nanoparticles for genome editor delivery to HSPCs in vivo will be determined. The biodistribution and HSPC tropism of mAb-labeled ELP nanoparticles in wild type mice will be evaluated by conducting pooled screens of nanoparticles loaded with unique DNA barcodes. The lead nanoparticle formulation identified from biodistribution studies will be assessed for Cas9 delivery efficiency in Ai9-SauSpyCas9 mice. The effects of mobilizing HSPCs to the peripheral blood on both nanoparticle biodistribution and HSPC editing efficiency will be defined. These studies will establish a non-viral delivery vector for in vivo genome editing of HSPCs, enabling the treatment of a wide variety of inherited hematologic disorders. By defining critical physicochemical principles that govern nucleic acid complexation and delivery by ELP nanoparticles, this work will also form a foundation for establishing ELPs as a platform for nucleic acid delivery to other cells and tissues."

The dynamic writing and erasing of histone post-translational modifications on nucleosomes regulate eukaryotic
gene expression by tuning chromatin organization and recruiting chromatin-binding proteins. The methylation of
arginines can activate or repress transcription depending on the histone residue and its methylation state. Protein
arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), along with its obligate binding partner Methylosome protein 50 (MEP50),
is the primary complex for the symmetric dimethylation of arginine across all eukaryotes. In addition, PRMT5-
MEP50 can either activate or repress the transcription of several genes, depending on which residue the enzyme
modifies. PRMT5-MEP50 catalyzes methylation on four histone residues, namely histone H2A-Arg3 (H2AR3),
H3-Arg2 (H3R2), H3-Arg8 (H3R8), and H4-Arg3 (H4R3). Due to PRMT5-MEP50’s diverse roles in transcription
regulation, PRMT5 is overexpressed in several cancers as it regulates the transcription of several metastasis
suppressor genes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition activating genes. Despite PRMT5-MEP50’s importance
in gene expression, very little is known of how PRMT5-MEP50 methylates histone and/or nucleosome
substrates. However, recent work has revealed that PRMT5’s specificity is regulated by (1) recognition of
cytosolic H2A-H2B dimers to methylate H2AR3 and (2) being able to preferentially methylate histone H4 in the
presence of substrate adaptor Coordinator of PRMT5 (COPR5). Despite these findings, molecular determinants
towards this specificity are still unknown. Using a combination of biochemical and structural approaches, I will
investigate the mechanism of histone specificity and activity by the PRMT5-MEP50 complex.
In Aim 1, I will determine contributions towards PRMT5-MEP50’s recognition of H2A-H2B dimers by quantifying
the activity and binding of PRMT5-MEP50 on various histone H2A-containing substrates. To provide molecular
detail of this recognition, I will determine the structure of PRMT5-MEP50 bound to H2A-H2B dimers using cryo-
electron microscopy (cryo-EM). While screening substrates of H2A methylation, I discovered that PRMT5-
MEP50 activity is stimulated by ubiquitination of histone H2BK120 (H2BK120-Ub). I will probe in vivo relevance
of this crosstalk by siRNA knockdowns. I will then reveal the mechanism of this activation by quantifying activity
and binding of PRMT5-MEP50 in the presence of H2BK120-Ub and resolving the EM structure of PRMT5-
MEP50 bound to H2A-H2BK120-Ub dimers. In Aim 2, I will elucidate the function of COPR5 and the PRMT5-
MEP50-COPR5 complex. My preliminary data revealed that COPR5 does not bind to nucleosomes and cannot
recruit PRMT5-MEP50 to the nucleosome, conflicting previous speculations of COPR5’s function. Therefore, I
will identify COPR5’s preferred histone-containing substrate and quantify COPR5’s binding and contribution to
the enzymatic activity of PRMT5-MEP50. Finally, I will solve the structure of PRMT5-MEP50-COPR5 bound to
its histone substrate by cryo-EM. Together, this proposal will construct a molecular framework of PRMT5-
MEP50’s substrate specificity to aid in structure-based drug design, by revealing substrate-specific interactions."

This application seeks continuation of funding for the Substance Use and HIV Prevention Research in Minority
Communities program (SUHPR) at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). SUHPR addresses the
urgent need to promote clinical prevention research and reduce health disparities in marginalized communities
where substance use is a crucial public health concern. SUHPR also aims to increase the number of scientists
from diverse backgrounds who attain NIH funding. Specifically, SUHPR will:
1) Increase visiting professor (VP) trainees' capacity to conduct interdisciplinary clinical research that
 elucidates and addresses the links between substance use and HIV in marginalized communities in line with
 NIDA and the NIH Office of AIDS Research (OAR) priorities;
2) Fund pilot studies to provide preliminary data for grant proposals;
3) Assist in the development of VP research careers and skills and the conceptualization, writing, submission,
 revision, and resubmission of NIH grants that focus on substance use, HIV prevention, and HIV care
 outcomes, via mentoring meetings, seminars, webinars, and peer networking; and
4) Sustain and expand the research programs of former VPs by engaging them via peer reviews and writing
 retreats, while leveraging their experience as peer reviewers, mentors, and collaborators.
Aims 1-3 will be accomplished through VPs participating in a three-year summer intensive program at UCSF.
Each VP will visit UCSF for six weeks per summer for three summers, attending seminars on HIV and
substance use research, methods, and grant writing. In the first summer, faculty mentors and peer VPs will
assist each VP to develop their research ideas into feasible research applications (Aim 1), develop a plan for
their pilot study (Aim 2), and begin drafting an NIH grant proposal (Aim 3). VPs will then initiate the pilot studies
during the academic year following the first summer. In the second summer, VPs will complete and submit their
NIH grant proposals. Following the second summer, VPs will present pilot study findings at scientific
conferences and draft manuscripts for publication submission. During the third summer, VPs will revise and
resubmit the proposal in response to NIH reviewer feedback. If VPs receive NIH funding prior to the third
summer, the VP program will mentor them in study start-up activities to enhance the rigor and likely success of
their NIH-funded studies. Between summers (during the academic year), faculty mentors will communicate with
VPs at least monthly, supplemented by webinars and virtual writing retreats. To fortify this intensive research
education experience, the SUHPR program will provide scientific peer reviews and consultations after the third
summer to help VPs from diverse backgrounds remain in the research pipeline and extend their innovative
programs of substance use and HIV research (Aim 4). We will involve successful former VPs for peer reviews,
mentoring, and collaboration activities with current VPs."
10817039,"This Maximizing Investigators Research Award (MIRA) application is proposed to support research in
the Beal lab at UC Davis focused on defining and controlling protein-RNA interactions in RNA editing
and RNA interference pathways. The RNA editing ADAR enzymes convert adenosines (A) to inosines
(I) in duplex RNA. Since I can behave similarly to guanosine (G) in RNA, this modification can have
profound effects on the structure and function of the modified RNA including, but not limited to,
changes in the meaning of specific codons (recoding). Mutations in the human ADAR1 gene cause
the skin disorder Dyschromatosis Symmetrica Hereditaria (DSH) and the autoimmune disease Aicardi-
Goutieres Syndrome (AGS). Also, ADAR1 upregulation and hyper editing has been observed in
several different cancers. Despite the significance of this form of regulation of RNA structure and
function, there remain key gaps in our understanding of A to I RNA editing. In addition, given ADARs’
ability to change RNA sequence, there is growing interest in harnessing this property and directing it
to correct disease-associated G-to-A mutations. Key questions in this field that will be addressed in
this project are: 1) What are the structures of key protein-RNA complexes in editing pathways?
Structures of full length human ADAR2 bound to different RNA substrates along with structures of
ADAR1 bound to RNA are necessary for a full understanding of substrate recognition and selectivity
in RNA editing. 2) Can we develop potent, selective and low MW ADAR inhibitors? Such inhibitors
could serve as lead compounds in the development of ADAR1-targeted cancer therapies. 3) Can we
develop new strategies to evolve mutant editing enzymes and novel substrate RNAs? The
results of these efforts will inform the design of highly efficient and selective reagents for directed RNA
editing applications.
 Our laboratory also has a long standing interest in the development of chemical modifications of
RNA that can control the interaction with RNA-binding proteins. Much of our recent work in this area
has focused on controlling the interaction of RNA with components of siRNA-triggered or miRNA-
triggered gene silencing pathways. The use of the RNAi pathway to study gene function has become
a powerful tool in molecular biology and has been exploited in the development of new therapeutics.
However, specific issues exist that limit its application. These issues include off-target effects that
arise from the ability of an siRNA guide strand to function as a miRNA. In addition, antisense
oligonucleotides targeting miRNAs (anti-miRs) have significant therapeutic potential and require
chemical modification for stability and efficacy. Up to this point, the development of new chemical
modifications of therapeutic RNAs has been largely an ad hoc process. The key question addressed
in this aspect of the proposed project is: Can we develop an effective systematic approach to new
RNA modifications that modulate protein-RNA interactions in interference pathways? The
immediate impact of these studies will be to provide new modifications to siRNAs and anti-miRs that
improve potency and selectivity. However, our continued refinement of an approach that uses
computational screening coupled with versatile RNA modification chemistry will be generally
applicable other projects that involve chemically modified RNA for therapeutics."
10854727,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has produced remarkable results in otherwise treatment-
refractory hematological malignancies. Currently, the process of manufacturing autologous CAR T cells is
challenging due to the need for de novo generation of each individualized therapy and the inherent variability in
T cell biology between patients, leading to unpredictable and inconsistent clinical responses. As a result, there
is a growing interest in generating CAR T cells in vitro from an infinitely renewing, allogeneic source of human
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). One advantage of this approach is that hPSCs are highly amenable to genetic
editing, providing multiple avenues to manipulate the function of the final T cell product.
 However, there are several biologic barriers to generating CAR T cells from hPSCs. First, expression of
the CAR transgene early in T cell differentiation diverts development towards the innate lymphoid pathway
instead of the conventional T lineage. Second, the removal of the endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) to prevent
alloreactivity leads to a block in development, as maturing T cells can no longer undergo positive selection.
This proposal seeks to overcome these challenges to generating non-alloreactive, stem cell-derived CAR T
cells by deploying an innovative stage-specific expression strategy and a novel in vitro method to induce the
differentiation of mature conventional T cells, the Artificial Thymic Organoid (ATO) system.
 The ATO is a first-in-class, in vitro method for efficiently generating mature, single positive (SP) CD8+
and CD4+ T cells from multiple stem cell sources, including hPSCs. Improving upon previously established
systems, the ATO can robustly support positive selection and maturation to the SP stage. Our preliminary studies
have already demonstrated that innate fate diversion can be overcome by achieving delayed, stage-specific
expression of the CAR transgene that is limited to mature T cells. In this proposal, Specific Aim 1 will build upon
the delayed CAR expression model and evaluate how the disruption of the endogenous TCR affects CAR T cell
development in the ATOs. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate two different methods of delivering exogenous positive
selection signals to rescue development in the absence of the endogenous TCR. These methods include
expression of a tonically signaling CAR or transiently expressing an exogenous TCR at the physiologically
appropriate double positive (DP) T cell stage. The approaches developed in this proposal will enable the
generation of hPSC-derived, non-alloreactive T cell therapy, ultimately reducing the cost and increasing the
access to treatment for more patients in need."
10810846,"Control of gene expression in space and time plays an important role in enabling cells to “know” where they are in the
developing embryo and what to become, a process often referred to as cellular specification. Decades of research have
demonstrated numerous layers of regulation in control of gene expression, at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional
level, which coordinate this process. Translational control of gene expression has, on the contrary, received less
experimental attention. Most notably, the prevailing dogma has been that at the level of protein production, the ribosome -
although an immensely complex molecular machine- possesses a constitutive rather than regulatory function in translating
mRNAs. Our findings have established a new field of study by demonstrating that ribosomes are highly regulatory in control
of the expression of developmental gene regulatory networks underlying tissue patterning and formation of the mammalian
body plan. In our most recent studies, we have identified entire biological pathways in embryonic stem cells represented
by the translational preferences of specific ribosomes, that differ in the composition of their ribosomal proteins (RPs) or the
interaction of novel ribosome-associated proteins (RAPs) that we have recently identified that directly associate with
mammalian ribosomes. We have further shown ribosome heterogeneity in proximity to key cellular organelles as a
mechanism to control localized protein production within subcellular space. These findings change our understanding of
gene regulation and open a new portal of study into an additional layer of gene expression vital to control of cell
specification, tissue patterning, and embryonic development. In this proposal we will undertake a highly multidisciplinary
approach to characterize this novel regulatory code for translational control of the circuitry of key developmental networks.
In Aim1 we will extend our new roadmap of ribosome heterogeneity indicated by the presence of distinct ribosomes during
primary human ES cellular differentiation to an organismal level. In particular, we will leverage novel genetic tools to study
ribosome biology in-vivo. Using this approach, we will delineate the mechanisms by which a single RP can control a
paramount step in embryonic development, namely sustained paraxial mesoderm formation, and its role in translational
control of the WNT signaling pathway, which reflects a novel step in the regulation of a major signaling pathway in
development. In Aim2 we will undertake a systems level approach to characterize the role of ribosomes as key regulators
of cell fate transitions. We will utilize novel technologies to forcibly and inducibly remove specific RPs selectively from
cytoplasmic ribosomes for the first time and assess their individual functions on stem cells differentiation down the
mesoderm and endoderm lineages. In Aim3 we will functionally characterize alternative RP paralogs in mammary-glad
development for which our compelling preliminary data indicate that they translate distinct subsets of mRNAs during the
switch to lactation. We hypothesize that translation control is required to synthesize copious milk proteins critical for
neonate sustenance. Defining at a more basic level the specificity and dynamics of ribosome-mediated control gene
regulation will be invaluable for our understanding of how deregulations in the ribosome alter accurate control of gene
expression underlying human congenital birth defects."
10929934,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the prevalence of prostate cancer worldwide, we lack an understanding of the genetic events that drive
tumor initiation or drug resistance. Only a few genetic models exist, leaving hundreds of recurrent mutations
unaccounted for, and most studies interrogate gene function by overexpression or knockout rather than studying
the mutational variants present in disease. Better understanding of the mutations driving tumor initiation and
drug resistance could allow us to screen for precancerous lesions or prevent fatal disease progression, greatly
relieving the global burden of disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a new functional genomic approach
to enable the functional study of multiple genetic variants per cell to identify mechanisms of tumor initiation and
drug resistance. We have developed such a system in mouse prostate organoids by knocking out the tumor
suppressor Pten and the mismatch repair gene Msh2 to induce the accumulation of point mutations and indels.
This system has allowed us to interrogate which mutations complement PTEN loss to drive tumor initiation and
drug resistance in vivo. We have discovered that hotspot mutations in IRS4 and CDK4 are uniquely enriched
during tumor initiation and drug resistance, respectively. Thus, I propose to determine the mechanisms by
which IRS4 and CDK4 gain of function mutations complement PTEN loss to drive prostate cancer
initiation and drug resistance, respectively. In my first aim, I will test the necessity and sufficiency of IRS4
gain of function to drive tumor initiation through MAPK activation and downstream transcriptional alterations. For
my second aim, I will test the necessity and sufficiency of CDK4 gain of function to drive drug resistance through
cell cycle dysregulation and investigate the reversibility of this phenotype in patient-derived organoids. My
sponsor Rohit Bose, MD, PhD, has extensive experience in genetic and transcriptional network alterations
underlying prostate tumor initiation. My co-sponsor Kevin Shannon, MD, has renowned experience studying
MAPK circuitry and drug resistance in cancer. Additionally, I have secured scientific support and career
mentorship from a respected and prolific cadre of investigators with complementary expertise, Dr. Felix Feng
(prostate cancer genomics), Dr. Rahul Aggarwal (drug-resistant tumor samples), Dr. Catherine Smith (cell cycle
dysregulation and tumor evolution), Dr. Franklin Huang (prostate cancer genomics and health disparities), and
Dr. Hani Goodarzi (multi-omics and tumor evolution). Concurrently, I will continue bimonthly clinical
preceptorships with Drs. Aggarwal, Bose, and Feng at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer
Center. Overall, the proposed work will further our understanding of tumor initiation and drug resistance in
prostate cancer, laying the groundwork for improved detection and treatment. Moreover, this fellowship will foster
my training in cancer biology and genetics, supporting me through combined MD/PhD training towards a career
as an academic medical oncologist studying tumor evolution and drug resistance in prostate cancer."
10754277,"Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common and serious postoperative complication among the elderly, especially
those with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and has no available treatments. Interestingly, the risk for POD begins at
preclinical AD stages when mild sustained attention deficits emerge. For this K99/R00, I will investigate the role
of the locus coeruleus and ventral tegmental area – two regions affected by AD pathology and inhibited by
general anesthetics – on the development of sustained attention deficits and POD using the rodent model of AD,
TgF344-AD. I have developed a variant of the 5-choice serial reaction time task, a touchscreen sustained
attention task, in which real-time cognitive recovery is assessed in rats following general anesthesia to capture
the severity and duration of POD symptoms. In Aim 1 (K99), I will characterize the progression of sustained
attention deficits in TgF344-AD and aging rats and its association with POD and AD histopathology. In Aim 2.1
(K99), I will use a novel dual-viral mediated chemogenetic targeting technique to establish the role of ventral
tegmental area dopaminergic neurons in AD-related attentional impairments. With these skills, I will be well-
equipped to independently pursue Aim 2.2 (R00), which applies the same techniques to investigate
noradrenergic locus coeruleus neurons in AD-related attention impairments, and Aim 3 (R00), where chronic
and acute activation of the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus will be used to mitigate AD-associated
POD. My overall career goal is to lead an independent research group examining the underlying neural circuits
impacting POD in AD with the long-term goal of creating interventional therapeutic strategies against dementia-
associated POD. To accomplish this goal, I will need additional training in chemogenetic techniques, transgenic
rodent models of AD, and AD neuropathology. For the K99 phase, I will have the guidance of my mentor, Dr.
Ken Solt, who will train me in chemogenetics, and co-mentor, Dr. Zhongcong Xie, an expert in AD and POD
research. My Advisory Committee, Drs. Christiane Wrann (AD transgenic model expertise) and Timothy Houle
(statistics expertise), will provide research and professional guidance as I near independence. My career
development plan integrates didactics in AD pathology and neuroengineering; training in communication, lab
management, and grant writing; and professional networking opportunities. Massachusetts General Hospital and
Harvard Medical School provide the ideal environment to conduct the proposed research, providing all the
facilities necessary within a supportive, collaborative team of researchers and clinicians. The protected time and
mentorship provided by this K99/R00 will allow me to acquire the technical and conceptual skills required to lead
a focused research program on POD and AD research as an independent investigator. The outcome of this work
will yield important insight into the role of neural circuits implicated in prodromal AD and aging and how they may
be targeted to prevent and treat POD."
10781950,"SUMMARY
While significant progress has been made in the past decade with immunotherapy for metastatic melanoma and
renal cell carcinoma (RCC), not all patients respond, and others develop resistance over time. Hundreds of novel
regimens are being developed to overcome primary and acquired resistance. Some combinations increase the
infiltration of cytotoxic T cells in the tumor to kill cancer cells, while others modulate tumor-associated
macrophages (TAMs) to enhance the T cell activity in the tumor microenvironment. However, toxicity to patients
is an important limitation to immunotherapy regimens. Non-invasive imaging techniques are needed to determine
response to combination therapy to save potential non-responders from unnecessary toxicity. Current imaging
techniques do not assess the dynamic changes in the levels of T cells and TAMs at the same time. The overall
hypothesis is that imaging the infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and TAMs concurrently can better determine
response to immunotherapy regimens.
The goal of this proposal is to develop non-invasive imaging probes for single photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) imaging of T cells and TAMs concurrently to determine response to combination therapy.
We anticipate that SPECT will accurately recapitulate pathology and may ultimately replace on-treatment
biopsies in patients who might have pseudoprogression. SPECT may also complement tissue-based analyses
to further interrogate the tumor microenvironment through digital spatial profiling (DSP), an in situ profiling
method that preserves spatial information. DSP can quantify multiple biomarkers simultaneously in immune cells
responsible for the tumor’s sensitivity to combination therapy. In our preliminary work we developed the tools to
implement the tracking of CD8+ T cells and CD68+ TAMs in vivo with radiolabeled antibodies. We will test our
SPECT agents in established murine tumor models of melanoma and RCC in mice with intact immune systems.
We will characterize their binding properties to CD8+ T cells and CD68+ TAMs in vitro (Aim 1). We will image
tumoral T cell and TAM infiltration in vivo by SPECT imaging in syngeneic tumor models of melanoma and RCC
and assess activation status of immune cells by DSP after immunotherapy in murine and patient tissues (Aim
2). These studies will lay the foundations for future clinical trials of dual-isotope SPECT in immunotherapy-treated
patients."
10832561,"This proposal describes a five-year career development program to prepare the candidate, Dr. Nan Xu, for a
career as independent investigator at a major academic research institute, with the expertise of modeling
dynamics of brain causal system to provide novel insights into the basic pathophysiology of neurologic disorders.
This proposal develops upon Dr. Nan Xu’s expertise in mathematical modeling and algorithm development to
translate model inferences in neurologic disorders and therapeutic practices; while training her to ask scientific
questions relevant to clinical practice and neurophysiological pathology. The PI will be mentored at Biomedical
Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University by Drs. Shella Keilholz (blood oxygenation level dependent
(BOLD) dynamics and their neurophysiological origins), Vince Calhoun (translational image analysis and
biomarkers), and Jason Allen (clinical training in neurologic disorders). Their complementary expertise will help
PI to bridge the gap between her analytical expertise and problems in clinical neurology and cognitive
neuroscience that need to be addressed.
In the brain causal system, evidence has shown that the directed information transfer may comprise not only a
strength, but also a duration and a capacity. The latter two metrics imply important neuroscientific aspects that
have not been well studied in the past. They may play key roles in pathological dysfunctions such as the
vestibular syndrome which occurs in 80% of patients following concussion. In PI’s thesis work, an innovative
measure was developed to predict the first two metrics. Building upon this work, novel theoretical and
computational approaches will be developed in this study to further evaluate the temporal variability in the
strength and duration of information transfer
(K99)
, and then to characterize the information capacity as well as
to evaluate the temporal variability of all three causal metrics
(R00)
. The causal estimates of resting BOLD data
will be validated against the estimates of the concurrently recorded local field potential (LFP) data, and task-
evoked BOLD data (
for both K99 and R00
). Finally, findings (
in both K99 and R00
) will be translated into clinical
studies of patients with different severity of vestibular syndromes. The specific aims are to: (1) model and
compute the time-varying spatiotemporal functional causal interactions among functional brain regions; (2)
evaluate the reliability and sensitivity of the estimated time-varying causal metrics using multimodal brain
imaging data of rodents and human, and (3) access the time-varying causal patterns in patient brains with
different severity of post-concussive visual motion sensitivity, which is one type of vestibular syndromes that
were commonly occurred in patients after concussion.
Successful project completion would potentially transform the rapidly evolving field of dynamics modeling in
brain causal system, facilitate basic neuroscience discovery, enable comprehensive identification of neurologic
disorders, and inspiring new animal experiments for studying neurological diseases."
10829341,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart diseases are the number one leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, responsible for
over 655,000 American deaths each year. The most prevalent cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as
coronary artery disease (CAD) arise from the interplay between complex genetic variants and environmental
factors. In particular, the low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is critical contributing factor to atherosclerosis and
increased risk of CVD. The use of statin drugs considerably reduced the incidence of CVD. Despite the
enormous progress of clinical practice in the past 30 years, insufficient LDL-cholesterol reduction and relatively
high residual risk remains for a significant proportion of statin-treated patients with or without combination
therapy, likely due to persistent relatively high triglyceride (TG) levels. This underscores the need for additional
new therapies targeting lipid metabolism in CVD prevention and treatment. Recent advances in genome
editing technologies, in particular the base editors, empower us to explore the feasibility of precise correction of
genetic mutations for genetic cardiomyopathy such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). In a mouse
model of DMD, we recently achieved a near complete dystrophin restoration in the heart after a systemic
delivery of adenine base editor and the gRNA with adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9). Leveraging this exciting
advancement in the in vivo base editing technology, here we will develop more broadly applicable therapeutic
strategies to combat CVD in a “hit-and-run” fashion (a technology we referred to as diBE), thus minimizing the
potential risks associated with AAV-mediated persistent expression of base editing reagents, which are known
to have intrinsic off-target DNA and RNA editing activities. We will determine the therapeutic potential of diBE-
mediated silencing of Asgr1 for protection against high fat diet induced hypercholesterolemia and
atherosclerosis in mice. Completion of these studies will have a high potential for making a major impact on the
development of novel base editing therapies to treat hyperlipidemia and CVD."

Chronic pain and prescription opioid use are common in older adults, with prevalent opioid use in 10% of those
greater than 65 years of age. Epidemiological investigations have noted accelerated rates of cognitive decline
in older adults with chronic pain,1 and recent evidence suggests that opioid use may be a risk factor.2–4 Our
preliminary data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) shows a more than 30% increase in the odds of
prevalent mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s disease dementia in those utilizing prescription
opioids at study enrollment. If the association between opioid use and clinically-relevant cognitive decline is
confirmed, it would have profound consequences for the management of chronic pain in older adults.
The long-range goal of the applicant is to become a successful independent translational clinician-scientist
leading a multidisciplinary team to optimize analgesic, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes in older adults.
The scientific objectives of this application are: 1) to evaluate the relationships between prescribed opioids
and longitudinal changes in global and domain-specific cognitive function in a population-based study of older
adults, 2) to assess the relationships between prescribed opioids and longitudinal changes in brain
morphometry, and 3) to explore the perceptions of older adults with chronic pain on the impact of opioids on
analgesia and cognition through qualitative analysis. The training goals of the applicant involve 4 areas:
epidemiology, cognitive outcome assessment, structural neuroimaging, and qualitative methods.
Aim 1: To evaluate the relationships between opioid prescriptions, longitudinal changes in global and domain-
specific cognitive z-scores, and incident MCI or dementia in a population-based cohort of older adults.
 Utilizing the resources available through the MCSA, including longitudinal assessments of global and
 domain-specific cognition and diagnostic evaluations for MCI and dementia, we will assess the relationships
 between prescription opioid use and cognition with appropriate adjustment for confounding variables.
Aim 2: To assess the relationships between prescribed opioids and longitudinal changes in brain morphometry
in a broad population-based cohort of older adults enrolled in the MCSA.
 Utilizing longitudinal MRI data from the MCSA, we will assess the relationships between prescription
 opioids, changes in brain structure, and neuropsychological outcomes.
Aim 3: To describe the experiences and perceptions of older adults with chronic pain on the impact of opioids
on analgesia and cognition through qualitative analysis.
 We will employ qualitative methods to explore perceptions and experiences of opioid therapy for chronic
 pain management, including analgesic efficacy and concerns for short- and long-term changes in cognition."

The efficient and stereoselective preparation of chiral organic molecules is vitally important to the development
of new therapeutic agents. However, despite significant progress, many desirable complex 2D and 3D molecular
scaffolds remain difficult to access or are inefficiently prepared. Consequently, development of new
transformations that provide synthetic chemists with strategic bond disconnections that facilitate de novo
approaches to organic synthesis is of great importance. In addition, such methods should be robust, practical,
allow the preparation of useful amounts of material, and ideally employ readily available starting materials. The
aim of this MIRA grant is the conversion of an NIGMS funded project with a long-term goal that broadly seeks to
develop and exploit new, practical, and efficient stereoselective new technologies for organic synthesis of
molecular scaffolds of biological importance that are otherwise difficult to access, or inefficiently prepared via
current processes. To this end, we are interested in developing transformations that leverage the broad chemical
reactivity of boron-stabilized chemical synthons for complex molecule synthesis. This approach is attractive
because reactions of such intermediates permit novel bond constructions and simultaneous installation of a
synthetically desirable boron moiety. The proposed studies described in this program will further our expanding
studies of catalytic stereoselective C–C bond forming reactions with organoboron reagents. These readily
accessible reagents merge powerful bond forming reactivity with broad synthetic utility, to deliver versatile
organic compounds of notable significance for fragment-based drug discovery. Building off our previous work,
we are developing new catalytic C–C, C–N, and C–X bond forming methods for the synthesis of chiral amines,
alcohols, and aromatic structures, with a particular focus on examples that contain quaternary carbon
stereogenic centers. We envision that chiral metal nucleophiles can be accessed by enantioselective
transmetalation of readily accessible achiral organodiboron reagents. The resultant nucleophilic species can
engage in a number of enantioselective reactions with various C=O, C=N, C–X electrophiles. We also aim to
target the generation and utility of novel boron-functionalized synthons by metal-free Lewis base catalysis for
reactions with electrophiles that are difficult to achieve via transition metal catalysis. Importantly, enantioselective
variants of these unknown reactions will herein be explored. Furthermore, new nucleophilic aromatic substitution
reactions of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds with organoboron carbon nucleophiles will be developed
that operate under metal-free conditions. Overall, by exploring synthetic reactions of organoborons, these studies
in methods development will introduce new transformations and strategies that will streamline synthetic chemists'
approaches to complex molecules important to biomedical research."

 CRISPR-Cas9 is the core of a transformative genome editing technology that is innovating life
science with cutting-edge impact in basic and applied sciences. By enabling the correction of DNA
mutations, this technology promises to treat a myriad of human genetic diseases, as shown for the first
cancer patients treated with CRISPR-Cas9–modified T-cells. This technology is based on the
endonuclease Cas9, which associates with guide RNAs to recognize and cleave complementary DNA
sequences. Ceaseless development and engineering of CRISPR-Cas9 tools has opened novel
intriguing hypotheses that grant in-depth investigations of the system. Here, the PI will implement
unconventional multiscale approaches, combining a variety of state-of-the-art theoretical methods, to
clarify the metal-dependent catalysis, the allostery in the selectivity mechanisms, as well as the inhibition
of the system. We will pursue three specific aims, characterizing: (Aim 1) the DNA cleavage dependency
on alternative divalent metal ions other than Mg2+ and the conformational effects associated with their
binding; (Aim 2) the allosteric modulation witnessed in newly engineered Cas9 variants with enhanced
specificity; (Aim 3) the inhibition mechanism by naturally occurring anti-CRISPR proteins to implement
control over gene regulation. Toward these aims, we will leverage classical and enhanced sampling
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, high-level ab-initio MD (using the Car-Parrinello and Born-
Oppenheimer approaches) and mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)
approaches. Moreover, combination of ab-initio MD with graph theory will implement a synergistic
approach capturing instantaneous sub-nanosecond signaling transfers. This will reveal how long-range
allosteric effects impact the dynamics through evolving catalytic steps, elucidating the role of allostery
in aiding catalysis. These multiscale approaches will offer a computational framework for the biophysical
analysis of not only CRISPR-Cas9, but can also be extended to emerging CRISPR systems that are
promising for genome editing and viral detection. Theoretical studies will be performed in close
collaboration with experimental scientists, providing kinetic measurements and biophysical
characterization, assisting in the interpretation of the experimental data and enabling testable
predictions. Overall, this proposed research will expand the repertoire of mechanistic knowledge
regarding the CRISPR-Cas9 function and lay the framework for novel engineering rationales toward
improved genome editing."
10831421,"ABSTRACT – MECHANISTIC PHARMACODYNAMIC MODELING FOR DRUG COMBINATIONS
Most industries simulate design options before implementation, but this is rarely possible in the pharmaceutical
and medical industries. An important gap is unbiased drug combination response predictions, which is
experimentally impractical. A long-term vision of our lab is improving drug development and precision medicine
by building “mechanistic pharmacodynamic models” that can simulate drug combination responses. Such
models infuse pharmacology concepts with physics and engineering approaches to describe causal, quantitative,
and dynamic mechanisms underlying drug response. A foundational premise is that capturing (i) mechanistic,
causal network structure, (ii) dose-response, (iii) dynamics, and (iv) cell-cell variability is necessary to improve
many combination response predictions. Here, we study how drug combinations affect single-cell
proliferation and death fates by merging theoretical and experimental innovation. The first project builds
on our recent and one of the most comprehensive mechanistic models for regulation of single-cell proliferation
and death dynamics. We will leverage our involvement with a recent LINCS consortium effort that generated a
deep molecular characterization of perturbation response dynamics, including dose responses to 8 drugs. We
will integrate network biology with mechanistic models using new approaches to obtain candidate models that
are consistent with this dataset, and experimentally test drug combination predictions for the 8 drugs. This will
for the first time address the prediction of a comprehensive set of drug combination responses across varied
mechanisms of action relying on causal biochemical reasoning and also identify novel mechanisms of signaling
and drug response through iterative model refinement and experimental validation. The second project builds
on our recently developed experimental approach for fluorescence multiplexing called MuSIC. We propose that
MuSIC can enable high-dimensional genetic interaction screening in single mammalian cells, which is not yet
possible but would be transformative. We will test the approach by evaluating genetic interactions between a
recently curated set of 667 gene targets of 1,578 FDA-approved drugs. This work will nominate new network
structures not only for use in the first project, but also more generally. The third project also leverages the
above mechanistic model but pivots across cell lines with Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data for 1,132 cell lines
and 24 drugs. An innovative and foundational feature of our model is that it ingests multi-omic data to create a
cell line-specific context through “initialization”. We will generate 1,132 model variants with cell line-specific
profiles and evaluate predictive capacity for single and prioritized drug combination responses. This project will
establish performance of the current models, identify critical modeling gaps for improving predictions, suggest
new potentially effective drug combinations, and elucidate mechanisms underlying synergy. Overall, these
projects will produce next-generation pharmacodynamic models that move towards filling the drug combination
prediction gap that hinders drug development and precision medicine."

completed internal medicine residency and hematology/oncology fellowship training at the University of
Pennsylvania, and I am currently a Senior Fellow/Program Scholar who will transition in July 2021 to an
Instructor and attending physician in the Division of Hematology/Oncology at UPenn. I am specifically seeking
to develop and refine the skills that will be required for a successful career as an independent investigator,
including expertise in gene regulation, signaling pathways, functional genomics, and bioinformatics. My
overarching goal is to improve therapeutic approaches for sickle cell disease (SCD) via study of key signaling
pathways that regulate expression of the fetal form of hemoglobin. My mentor for this award is Dr. Gerd Blobel,
an internationally recognized leader in erythroid gene regulation and hemoglobin switching. To add depth and
breadth to my scientific and career guidance, I have assembled a Mentoring Committee composed of
physician-scientists from diverse and complementary fields. I will have the full resources of UPenn and the
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia available for the completion of my research and career development goals.
 The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of PP6C, a novel regulator of fetal
hemoglobin, to improve upon current treatments for SCD and beta-thalassemia. SCD afflicts millions of people
worldwide and can lead to severe complications including acute chest syndrome, stroke, avascular necrosis of
bone, and nephropathy. Although increasing levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) significantly reduces cell sickling
and SCD-related morbidity and mortality, effective HbF pharmacologic induction has been an elusive goal. To
this end, I recently carried out a CRISPR-Cas9 based screen to identify additional potentially druggable
molecules to increase HbF production; this screen uncovered the protein phosphatase PP6C as a novel HbF
regulator. This proposal will explore PP6C-regulated pathways with both hypothesis-driven and unbiased
approaches and will investigate suitability of PP6C as a target for HbF induction. These objectives will be
achieved via three Specific Aims: to elucidate key mechanistic pathways in the regulation of HbF by PP6C, to
explore potential cooperativities of PP6C with other HbF regulatory pathways utilizing CRISPR-Cas12a-based
techniques; and to test the role of PP6C-mediated HbF regulation in SCD and in vivo models. The outcome of
these studies will deepen our understanding of signaling pathways that govern HbF expression and unveil new
therapeutic opportunities in SCD. Completion of these aims will consolidate my experience in models of
hemoglobin switching, further my training in bioinformatics and functional genomics, and provide the basis for a
future R01 funding proposal. These studies will leave me uniquely prepared for an independent career as a
physician-scientist with a focus on red cell biology and hemoglobinopathies."

Antibiotic treatment impairs colonization resistance, thereby increasing the risk of infection with
Enterobacteriaceae that are frank (e.g. non-typhoidal Salmonella serovars) or opportunistic (e.g.
carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) pathogens. However, how the host contributes to
colonization resistance against pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae remains incompletely understood.
The host uses “habitat filters” to select for microbial traits permitting survival and growth in the
host, thereby shaping composition, spatial organization and size of microbial communities. Our
goal is to elucidate how the host contributes to colonization resistance against pathogenic
Enterobacteriaceae and to develop approaches aimed at restoring this nonspecific immune
function during antibiotic therapy. We hypothesize that a mechanistic understanding of how the
host contributes to colonization resistance against pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae will facilitate
the development of drugs that target host signaling pathways to strengthen colonization
resistance. We will test different aspects of our hypothesis in two specific aims. Specific Aim 1
will identify resources that a shift in epithelial metabolism provides for pathogenic
Enterobacteriaceae to overcome niche modification by microbiota-derived short-chain fatty acids.
Specific Aim 2 will provide a proof-of-principle for the idea drugs targeting the host can strengthen
colonization resistance, thus making it possible to preserve this nonspecific immune function
during active antibiotic therapy. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide
mechanistic insights into a key function of the microbiome, which will be of wide appeal among
researchers interested in microbial pathogenesis, microbiota research, and intestinal biology."
10812474,"Cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 has been reported in almost every age-dependent neurodegenerative
disease, including in >40% of frontal temporal dementia (FTD), in the hippocampal neurons of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) patients, in >90% of ALS, and in ~100% of a recently recognized AD-like dementia in the oldest
of the elderly, an AD-like syndrome identified in 2019 and named Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43
Encephalopathy (LATE). We have demonstrated that TDP-43 phase separation and aggregation can drive
neuronal death independent of RNA binding, stress granule formation, and TDP-43 association with stress
granules. We have subsequently identified that acetylation of TDP-43 (which abolishes its RNA binding)
drives its separation into liquid spherical annular bodies. These nuclear annuli have liquid annular shells
enriched in TDP-43 and liquid centers highly enriched in HSP70 family molecular chaperones. Use of
inhibitors of known deacetylases or the proteasome (to mimic the known age-dependent declines in deacetylase
and proteasome activities) provokes cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregation. We propose to determine the biological
and pathological role(s) of acetylated TDP-43 and how HSP70 chaperone activity regulates nuclear TDP-43
function and its aggregation in the cytoplasm. We will determine the regulation and biological consequences of
acetylated TDP-43 in neurons by identifying the key regulatory enzymes (acetyltranferases and deacetylases)
of acetylated TDP-43 and alter TDP-43’s function in RNA splicing and its subcellular localization/aggregation.
To understand how HSP70 family molecular chaperones regulates phase transition of TDP-43, we will use Hsc70
(encoded by the HSPA8 gene and the most abundant HSP70 in neurons) and determine how Hsc70 interacts
with TDP-43. We will also determine if enhancing the activity of HSP70 (such as HSPA8, which is highly
expressed in neurons) ameliorates TDP-43 pathology. We will also develop a potential therapeutic approach for
TDP-43 proteinopathies in which rapid proteasome-mediated degradation of aggregated TDP-43 is achieved
through an engineered E3 ubiquitin ligase linked to a synthetically evolved nanobody (a single chain
antibody derived from an antibody heavy chain) recognizing either acetylated or phosphorylated TDP-43.
Outcomes of these efforts will provide key insights for understanding basic aspects of TDP-43 biology and
pathobiology in common dementia, and for developing a new concept of therapy that specifically targets TDP-
43 pathology that could potentially benefit aged patients with TDP-43-related dementia."
10848232,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Project 1(Kumar)
The long-term goal of Project 1 is to study the mechanisms of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) actions in
gonads and extra-gonadal tissues in the aging female. Both the FSH subunits are glycosylated with two N-linked
sugar chains on each subunit. It is known that glycosylation of FSH is estrous/menstrual cycle- and age-specific.
Previous studies identified FSH variants consisting of 2 sugar chains on the α but either one or none on the β
subunit. These variants are known as hypoglycosylated FSH glycoforms and designated as FSH21, and FSH18,
in contrast to the fully glycosylated FSH24. Most importantly, the ratio of hypo- (FSH21 or FSH18) to fully-
glycosylated FSH forms (FSH24) is age-dependent, with high levels of FSH21/18 glycoforms predominant in
young age for optimal ovarian function and high levels of FSH24 predominantly present in peri/post-menopausal
women and may contribute to the aging-associated bone loss. However, the distinct in vivo biological functions
of these changing ratios of FSH glycoforms in vivo are unknown in ovarian and bone physiology in aging.
Moreover, whether the documented FSH actions on bone are mediated via the bona-fide ovarian FSH receptors
has never been tested. The central hypothesis is that estrogen regulates an age-dependent glycosylation switch
on FSH and the resulting shift in higher abundance of fully-glycosylated FSH24 mediates bone-specific actions
via FSH receptors on osteoclasts. This hypothesis will be tested using genetically engineered novel mouse
models. In Aim 1, we will purify GFP-tagged gonadotropes from young and old age female mouse pituitaries by
flow sorting and perform RNA-Seq analysis to identify age-specific and estrogen-dependent glycosylation
pathway enzymes. Additionally, we will introduce an HFSHB24 transgene onto gonadotrope-specific Esr1
conditional null background and determine whether loss of estrogen signaling leads to changes in abundance of
FSH glycoforms. In Aim 2, we will engineer Fshb null mice expressing either a FSH18 or a FSH21 hypo-
glycosylated form and a Tet-inducible HFSHB24 transgene. This genetic strategy will allow us to temporally
regulate at desired times, the age-specific changing ratios of FSH glycoforms and test systematically the in vivo
biological actions of changing ratios of FSH glycoforms in ovarian physiology in the absence of endogenous
mouse FSH. In Aim 3, we will selectively delete Fshr in osteoclasts by a Cre-lox genetic approach to
unequivocally test the direct cell-autonomous actions of FSH in osteoclasts in the bone. Successful completion
of Project 1 studies may unravel a novel phenomenon of age-dependent N-glycosylation switch on FSH resulting
in alterations in target tissue specificity (ovary versus bone) and may potentially lead to new therapeutic options
for preserving ovarian function and intervention of bone loss in aging women. The three Aims of Project 1 are
well integrated into the overall P01 which tests the central hypothesis that in the face a senescing ovary, the
switch from hypo-glycosylated to fully-glycosylated FSH, compromises reproductive potential and contributes to
other physiological changes, such as bone loss."

The University of Michigan (U-M) Rogel Cancer Center (Rogel) is committed to creating a supportive
environment for all and sustaining diversity of Rogel leadership, faculty, scientific workforce and trainees.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice (DEIJ) is one of six pillars for Rogel’s new five-year Strategic Plan
(2022-2027), and central to a comprehensive Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED). The Rogel DEIJ strategic plan
is informed by and integrated with U-M institutional efforts, and spans Rogel’s corresponding strategic pillars for
research, training, community outreach, patient care and infrastructure. The Rogel DEIJ Advisory Council
(DEIJ-AC) consists of faculty, staff, trainees, patients and community members, and meets quarterly to ensure
oversight of five key areas: Workforce, Leadership, Training and Education, Community Outreach, and Clinical
Research and Care. The Rogel PED ensures inclusive recruitment strategies and leverages institutional
commitment to recruit and retain diverse faculty, and utilizes established infrastructure to cultivate and promote
a supportive climate for both faculty and staff. New career development and research opportunities for
underrepresented populations in the scientific workforce (URSW) are proceeding to foster diversity in present
and future Rogel leadership, including an Emerging Leaders Council with seats on the Rogel Executive
Committee, and internal funding structures to support cancer health equity research. The diversity of the
Rogel pipeline is bolstered across the continuum by initiatives supporting regular engagement of trainees,
undergraduates and K-12 students with leaders from Rogel and U-M more broadly. Substantial
progress in systemic diversity enhancement throughout the Rogel has already been achieved, and dynamic
measures are already underway to further improve and ensconce the tenets of the Rogel DEIJ strategic pillar."

The Transgenic Animal Models Shared Resource (TAM-SR) was formally established in 1989 to provide
specialized equipment and expertise in transgenic technology and genome engineering to University of Michigan
(U-M) faculty. Recognizing its high scientific impact, TAM-SR had been continuously funded by the Cancer
Center Support Grant (CCSG) since 1996. The CCSG in combination with institutional support provides Rogel
Cancer Center (Rogel) members with a cost-effective resource that eliminates the need to independently
establish resource intensive assets in their individual laboratories. TAM-SR provides specialized equipment and
staff trained in embryo micromanipulation, CRISPR/Cas9 reagent construction/validation, embryonic stem cell
culture, and provides training in these technologies. Rogel members benefit from the ability to use genetically
engineered mouse models in their research at a reasonable cost because of the SR’s extensive capabilities and
expertise as well as institutional and CCSG support. TAM-SR is located in the School of Medicine in close
proximity to the majority of Rogel members."
10875469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS)
The University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center (Rogel) seeks to reduce the burden of cancer and advance
health equity through transdisciplinary collaboration in research, education, patient care and community
outreach. The Center places a high premium on leveraging its CCSG Developmental Funds to expand and
enhance catchment area impact including research across the basic, translational, clinical, population science
continuum. Developmental Funds support activities that are consistent with goals and strategic priorities in
Rogel’s 2022-2027 Strategic Plan – Discoveries to Cures to Communities – which has six pillars: Research;
Community Outreach; Education and Training; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice; Infrastructure and
Clinical Research; and Patient Care. Rogel uses Developmental Funds to support new faculty recruitment, with
an emphasis on diverse, early-stage investigators, as well as innovative research pilot projects. As part of the
new strategic plan, Rogel senior leadership has identified high priority areas of research that will inform future
faculty recruitment, including researchers with expertise in the following areas: epigenetics, systems biology,
metabolism and metabolomics, mechanisms of treatment resistance, cancer immunology and immunotherapy,
early-stage clinical research, epidemiology, and cancer health equity, among others. Rogel also supports
members to advance their research with two types of pilot projects, both supported by Developmental Funds:
• The Innovation Award, for innovative, high-risk projects that stimulate new multi-investigator projects and
 promote the development of new technologies
• The Catchment Area Award to support research in or related to the Rogel catchment area, including high
 priority cancers and behavioral risk factors."
10875470,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT)
The Rogel Cancer Center (Rogel) Shared Resources (SR) provide technical expertise, state-of-the-art
technologies, data analysis, and training to meet Rogel members’ diverse scientific needs and facilitate research
directed toward Rogel’s scientific themes. Rogel manages thirteen SRs and is proposing two developing SRs in
this application. The SR management team, consisting of the Associate Director for SRs (ADSR), the SR
Administrative Manager, and the Rogel Director of Finance, oversee SR scientific quality, accessibility,
operations, budgets, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the management team works with Rogel members
through meetings and surveys to determine members’ future SR needs and to identify those services that are
no longer needed. As a member of the Rogel Senior Leadership Council, the ADSR, presents survey results and
SR data to senior leadership for discussion and decisions. Examples include successful progression of the Single
Cell Spatial Analysis developing SR and the Proteomics SR to full SRs; the discontinuation of computational
imaging in the newly renamed and refocused Preclinical Molecular Imaging SR; and proposed establishment of
the Liquid Biopsy and Epigenetics and Epigenomics developing SRs. The annual operating budget of the
combined Rogel-supported SRs is approximately ~$17.6M, of which only ~$1.9M is from the Rogel CCSG,
~$1.7M is from institutional support (i.e., Medical School, Rogel, and departments), and ~$14M is from other
sources (e.g., chargebacks, other grants, and contracts). Thus, the CCSG supports only ~10.8% of the overall
operating expenses of the SRs demonstrating strong leveraging of these robust and diverse institutional and
other funding mechanisms for Rogel SRs. During the project period, Rogel SRs successfully competed for S10
grants resulting in ~$3.9M toward the acquisition of new equipment. Rogel SRs serve all of the Rogel Research
Programs resulting in support of an average of 209 publications annually, with 30% in high impact journals. To
continue providing innovative and effective support to Rogel members we propose the following specific aims:
(Aim 1) Provide relevant, distinctive, and innovative expertise and services that enhance research capability and
members’ collaborations; (Aim 2) Ensure accessibility, stability, reliability, quality, accountability, and cost
effectiveness of SRs; (Aim 3) Forecast and meet future scientific SR needs of Rogel members. We will achieve
these aims through a combination of communication with users and SR staff; critical evaluation of SR-relevant
metrics; and input from senior leadership, Program leaders and advisory boards. Through these activities, Rogel
SRs will continue to provide services that are critical to Rogel member research and to the Rogel mission."
10875472,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (LEADERSHIP, PLANNING AND EVALUATION)
The University of Michigan (U-M) Rogel Cancer Center (Rogel) has an effective and long-standing process for
leadership, planning and evaluation that engages Senior Leaders, Program Leaders, internal and external
leaders, Shared Resource (SR) Directors, Rogel members and staff. Rogel’s Senior Leadership is comprised
of nationally recognized, engaged experts who are strongly committed to the mission and vision of the Rogel
Cancer Center. Rogel Senior Leadership is intentional in establishing the membership of internal and external
advisory bodies to ensure diverse representation by gender, race, ethnicity, age, faculty rank (for internal
committees) and community, catchment area and national demographics (for external boards). Eric Fearon,
MD, PhD, is Director of the Rogel Cancer Center and Associate Dean for Cancer Programs in the U-M Medical
School. Fearon is supported by highly engaged, expert senior leadership and advisory committees. The Senior
Leadership Council (SLC), which meets weekly, is comprised of the Director, Deputy Director, and 11
Associate Directors. The SLC regularly engages with the Rogel Executive Committee (EC), comprised of SLC
and Research Program Leaders, Assistant Directors in COE and TrEC, SPORE leadership, the Emerging
Leaders Council Chair and Vice Chairs, senior advisors and communications. The EC meets monthly and
enables the SLC to discuss and jointly set priorities and future direction with PLs, as well as allows the PLs and
others to give feedback to the SLC on research progress and new developments. The Rogel External Advisory
Board (EAB) is a vital part of Rogel’s planning and evaluation process. The EAB, comprised of national leaders
with expertise in areas that align with Rogel’s Research Programs, SRs and components, meets at least yearly
and provides objective guidance and direction on Rogel’s strategic planning and initiatives. Rogel also
engages several internal and external advisory committees to provide objective oversight of SRs, TrEC, COE,
DEIJ, clinical research, and clinical services. Planning and Evaluation is essential to the cancer center’s
research mission and a regular part of the senior leadership’s activities. The 2022-2027 Rogel Strategic Plan –
Discovery to Cures to Communities – has six pillars: research; community outreach; education and training;
infrastructure and clinical research; Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Justice; and patient care. The SLC, with
support from the EC, will lead the implementation and execution of the new strategic plan, as well as monitor
progress against goals, inform resource allocation, and make course corrections as necessary. These
processes and committees enable the SLC to promote: i) collaborative, transdisciplinary research across the
cancer research continuum to advance Rogel’s scientific innovations; ii) programs in training, education and
career development to empower the next generation of diverse cancer researchers and providers; iii)
community engagement, research and educational initiatives to address the cancer burden across the

10875474,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT)
The Cancer Center Support Grant Clinical and Protocol Data Management (CPDM) requirements at the
University of Michigan (U-M) Rogel Cancer Center are fulfilled through the Oncology Clinical Trials Support Unit
(O-CTSU). The O-CTSU has evolved and strengthened its efforts during the project period with enhanced
effectiveness, efficiency, and overall support for cancer clinical trials across U-M.
The O-CTSU assists investigators in the creation, submission, review, activation, ct.gov registration, conduct,
oversight, and closeout reporting of innovative cancer clinical trials in an efficient, regulatory compliant, and
scientifically sound manner. By providing a comprehensive range of centralized services, including coordinator
staff, standardized policies and procedures, training and education, informatics, and specimen processing, the
O-CTSU helps ensure efficient and effective support for all cancer clinical trials. During the most recent period,
O-CTSU support for clinical research was reorganized so that it provides regulatory, data management, and
coordinator support in alignment with the 14 Clinical Research Teams (CRT). The CRTs consist of clinicians and
scientists from multiple disciplines along with their clinical research staff, organized along disease-related
themes. CRTs discuss new study concepts and trials; review trials for team interest, scientific merit, overlap and
feasibility; prioritize trial startup activities; review trial timelines; and review current trial accrual and participant
safety. By aligning support to the individual CRTs, the O-CTSU can link staffing and other resources to CRT
activity.
The O-CTSU interacts with Rogel Shared Resources and U-M units which provide complementary support
services for investigators, such as the Cancer Data Science Shared Resource (CDS-SR), the Rogel Tumor
Response Assessment Core (TRAC), University of Michigan Health (U-M Health) Research Pharmacy and
multiple units of the U-M Office of Research. The O-CTSU also supports Rogel’s obligation to monitor and ensure
representation of women, minorities, and individuals across the lifespan in clinical trials by providing reports,
dashboards, and tools to facilitate Rogel’s comprehensive plans to address these matters."

Core Lead: Ronald Hoffman, MD
The Administrative Core provides the infrastructure for and coordinates all activities of the Myeloproliferative
Neoplasm-Research Consortium (MPN-RC). The goal of the Core is to actively and dynamically maintain a
collaborative translational research network that supports and synergizes the laboratory and clinical studies led
by MPN-RC investigators. Key functions include organizational management and communication, resource
allocation and financial management (personnel, funds, equipment, and supplies), organization of all internal
and external advisory boards and committees, scientific and clinical trials oversight to ensure regulatory
compliance and procedural implementation, and external liaison to appropriate governmental agencies. The
specific aims of the Administrative Core are: (1) Coordinate the activities of all MPN-RC Projects and Cores and
monitor their progress and effective use of shared resource Cores; (2) Schedule and provide optimal staff
support for all MPN-RC committees and boards; (3) Assure that research involving the use of human subjects
and vertebrate animals is pursued in compliance with NIH regulations; (4) Establish all contracts with
participating organizations and administer and oversee all budgets and the disperal of funds; (5) Liaison to the

10866420,"Core B Abstract
Core Lead: Bridget Marcellino, MD, PhD
Core B, Tissue Bank provides the infrastructure to transport, receive, process, store, and distribute tissue
specimens obtained from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) enrolled on the longitudinal tissue
bank as well as patients enrolled on clinical trials (Project 4). These specimens are provided to MPN-RC
investigators performing translational research for the purpose of developing innovative therapies (Projects 1-3).
They are also provided to the Biomarker and Bioinformatics Core D to perform biomarker analyses to evaluate
the effectiveness or causes of resistance of specific therapies being evaluated to deplete MPN hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells. Tissues are also available to members of the scientific community at large for
translational research. Translational research is dependent on the ready availability of tissues from a sufficient
number of accurately diagnosed patients to generate statistically significant data. Because the MPNs are
relatively uncommon and their accurate diagnosis can be difficult, there has been a paucity of tissue, linked to
clinical data, available to individual investigators at single institutions. Core B fills this void. With an inventory of
specimens from more than 1700 individual patients with MPNs, Core B maintains one of the world’s largest
inventories of MPN tissues available for research. In addition, Core B collects specimens from patients
participating in MPN-RC sponsored clinical trials (Project 4) for the purpose of performing biomarker studies to
demonstrate the effectiveness of specific therapies on the depletion of MPN hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells. The specific aims of Tissue Bank Core B are the following: (1) Receive, process, cryopreserve, and store
tissues from MPN patients participating in a longitudinal tissue bank (MPN-RC 106) as well as patients enrolled
on clinical trials (Project 4) at MPN-RC clinical sites. (2) Provide a central repository for MPN tissues that are
associated with clinical and mutational annotation data stored in the web-based data bank maintained by
Biostatistics and Data Management Core C. This annotation, selection and distribution of tissues is tailored for
each translational research project. (3) a. Distribute tissues to MPN-RC investigators and the larger scientific
community for translational research dedicated to elucidating the mechanisms driving the pathogenesis and
progression of MPNs and developing novel therapeutic strategies to target MF stem cells. b. Distribute clinical
trial specimens to analyze on-target effects of novel agents and create biomarkers which will determine
therapeutic and pharmacodynamic responses to therapy (Core D). Core B is an essential shared resource that
enables translational research that will ultimately lead to the development of therapies, which target the MPN
stem cell."
10875476,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM)
The primary responsibility for the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) rests with the University of
Michigan Health Rogel Cancer Center (Rogel) Protocol Review Committee (PRC). The PRC is aided in its pursuit
of the PRMS Specific Aims by the Clinical Research Teams (CRT) which have specific, non-overlapping, and
well-defined roles. All cancer protocols undergo two-stage review, starting with the CRT review and the
culminating with PRC review.
CRTs are disease- and domain-oriented groups in the Rogel that serve as the nidus for patient-oriented research.
CRTs are led by mid-career and senior clinical investigators who have an academic primary focus on clinical
research, have significant experience as principal investigators on interventional cancer clinical trials (with
particular emphasis on investigator-initiated trials), and see patients in the clinics associated with their respective
disease team. The CRTs are charged with reviewing and prioritizing proposed cancer clinical trials within their
respective disease/domain that arise from the scientific themes in the Rogel Programs and elsewhere, both to
ensure scientific merit, and to increase the chances of success in implementation.
The PRC, which is comprised of experts in clinical research from diverse disciplines, provides independent peer
review of the scientific merit and feasibility of new cancer-related clinical protocols. It also monitors the scientific
progress of activated protocols to ensure that they continue to be of high scientific merit and priority, support the
Rogel research mission, and achieve accrual goals in a realistic timeframe. By providing this level of exceptional
peer-review oversight of cancer clinical research, PRMS helps to ensure that Rogel conducts high quality
protocols that are scientifically impactful, realize their accrual targets, and utilize Rogel resources wisely."
10828341,"Adults who have completed less education live shorter and less healthy lives. All indicators are
that this disparity is growing. Educational outcomes are closely tied to literacy and reading skill.
In order to improve educational outcomes for all students we need a research base that reflects
the population. This is currently not the case. Still today most research on reading is based on
English-speaking monolinguals. Yet, we know from recent research that reading for bilinguals is
fundamentally different from monolinguals. Therefore, theories based on monolingual speakers
cannot be applied across the gamut of language experience and linguistic diversity. The long-
term objective of this line of research is to test and extend current theories of reading so that
they address the unique cognitive characteristics of bilingual readers. The short-term goal of this
proposal is to test and extend a specific, influential model of discourse comprehension, the
landscape model, to bilingual readers. According to the model readers integrate information
across text through two types of retrieval: cohort-based retrieval and coherence-based retrieval.
Cohort-based retrieval is an implicit memory process, based on an automatic spread of
activation. Depending on a reader’s goals for comprehension, they may engage in more
effortful, coherence-based retrieval. This form of retrieval is controlled, deliberate and engaged
when a discrepancy is detected. Through this form of retrieval a reader seeks to establish global
coherence, seeking a way to integrate incoming information with an on-going representation of
the text as a whole. The specific aims of this proposal are to examine how the strength of
cohort-activation (Specific Aim 1) and coherence-based retrieval (Specific Aim 2) are affected
by the (1) match in language across texts, (2) genre of text and (3) cross-language reading
experience for bilinguals. The overall approach to achieving these aims will consist of
presenting Spanish-English bilingual university students pairs of text passages to read while
their eye-movements are recorded. Half of the passages will be narratives and half will be
expository, science texts. Passages will contain some facts that are revised in the second
passage, requiring the reader to update their representation of the discourse. Second passages
will either be in the same or different language as the first passage. The impact of these
variables on reading times for critical areas of text and responses to follow-up comprehension
questions will be examined through linear mixed-effect models and ANCOVA’s. We will also
include in the analyses scores that reflect participants’ experience reading in each of their
languages."
10896133,"This proposal’s objective is to identify critical cellular pathways triggered by the presence of DNA interstrand
crosslinks (ICLs) produced by mitomycins, and to identify how the structure of mitomycins ICLs determines
the cellular signaling leading to cell death/cell cycle arrest in the absence of a functioning p53. This study
includes mitomycin C (MC), an anti-cancer drug currently used in the clinics, decarbamoyl mitomycin C
(DMC), a derivative of mitomycinc (MC) and a novel MC-derivative, MC-Lex, synthesized in our laboratory.
These compounds form highly cytotoxic interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) that share common structural features.
MC forms the α-ICL with DNA, DMC the β-ICL and MC-Lex the γ-ICL. Representative conformations of the
three ICLs indicate that the level of DNA perturbation induced by each ICL increases in the order α<β<γ, with
the α-ICL inducing minimal DNA perturbation and the γ-ICL shows significant DNA distortion and widening
of the minor groove. Previous research has shown that the three drugs (MC, DMC, MC-Lex) also differ in
their cytotoxicity and p53 signaling. Since ICLs are the lesions primarily responsible for the cytotoxicity of
mitomycins, this indicates that the three ICLs could trigger very diverse biochemical cellular mechanisms,
mediated by specific mutations present in cancer cells, a hallmark of modern cancer therapy. The proposed
research will establish how the ICLs behave as biological signals to trigger different cell death/cell cycle arrest
pathways. Knowledge of how differences in the modification of the local DNA structure by mitomycins
correlates with their cytotoxicity is crucial for understanding the action of clinically used drugs. Therefore, the
study of these three structurally different ICLs (α/β/γ ICLs) provides an ideal model for identifying structural
features determining the cell-signaling outcome in the presence or the absence of a functioning p53 pathway.
Since p53 tumor suppressor is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers, the need to identify cellular
pathways that induce cell death or cell cycle arrest independently of p53 deserves substantial attention. This
has the potential to identify treatments that could be tailored to cancer cells with mutations in the p53 gene
for personalized treatment consideration based on the genetic makeup of a tumor. To correlate ICL structures
with signaling outcome, we will be pursue the following aims:
Specific aim #1: Synthesis of MC, DMC and MC-Lex ICLs (α,β,γ-ICLs) using biomimetic methods.
Specific aim #2: Determination of p53-dependent and independent DNA adducts (ICLs) response
mechanisms using quantitative label free proteomics and bioinformatics
Specific aim #3: Mechanistic of CHK1 mediated cell cycle arrest triggered by MC/DMC and α/β-ICL
Expected outcomes: This study will identify structural ICL features that determine the cell signaling outcome
in the presence or the absence of a functioning p53 pathway, a feature of particular interest for the
development of personalized anticancer therapy."
10909810,"Critical to bacterial survival is the proper coordination and response to external stress. For example, the
envelope stress response (ESR) allows bacteria to repair and defend against cell envelope damage, which is
often sustained during antibiotic exposure. However, overactivation of the ESR is toxic in various microbes,
suggesting that the ESR may be manipulated to kill bacteria. To exploit this vulnerability, how bacterial cells
overcome this toxicity and regulate ESR overactivation needs to be understood. Preliminary work uncovered
that the heat shock co-chaperone DnaJ regulates the sE-regulated ESR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The
objective of this application is to uncover the mechanism of this regulation and characterize its extent. Although
DnaJ, in complex with DnaK and GrpE, represses the heat shock response via degradation of this response’s
alternative sigma factor, preliminary data suggest that DnaJ regulates the activity of the P. aeruginosa sE
homolog AlgU via a different mechanism. The overarching hypothesis is that DnaJ does not regulate AlgU
activity via changes in protein levels of known ESR regulators, that instead DnaJ regulates AlgU activity and
the ESR via direct binding to this sigma factor, and that this role of DnaJ on the sE-dependent ESR may be
conserved across gram-negative bacteria. This hypothesis will be tested via three specific aims. In Aim 1, the
effect of DnaJ on gene expression and protein levels of AlgU-dependent ESR regulators will be determined via
RT-qPCR and Western Blot under conditions of ESR activation. In Aim 2, DnaJ binding partners that affect the
AlgU-dependent ESR will be identified. This Aim will examine which DnaJ domain is important for proper AlgU-
dependent ESR activation, if DnaJ binds to AlgU, and if the effect of DnaJ on the ESR requires DnaK, a DnaJ-
binding partner that is important for its functions in the heat shock response. In Aim 3, DnaJ-dependent
activation of the sE-regulated ESR will be examined in two other, highly genetically tractable gram-negative
bacteria, Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae, to examine if this mechanism is potentially conserved across
Gammaproteobacteria. The outcomes of these Aims are expected to define the mechanistic effect of DnaJ on
the ESR (Aims 1-2) and address the potential universality of this mechanism (Aim 3). Furthermore, this work
will add to our long-term goal of understanding the mechanism(s) underlying AlgU toxicity in P. aeruginosa,
which is important if therapeutics targeting the sE-dependent ESR are to be developed. These outcomes and
their potential applications are expected to have a positive impact on the growing problem of multidrug-
resistant infections. In addition, as DnaJ has been shown to affect multiple stress response systems in addition
to the ESR, this proposal speculates that DnaJ may be a universal stress coordination hub across bacteria,
emphasizing its importance in overall bacterial stress response. Finally, this work will benefit the research
excellence of a minority-serving institution by sustaining the program of a PI with a strong history of training
student researchers from marginalized groups."
10869931,"A key challenge of the post-genomic era is the functional interpretation of the vast numbers of single nucleotide variants
found in human genomes. This challenge is compounded by the fact that these variants contribute to complex traits and
diseases by interacting with one another and with genetic variation in repetitive DNA elements. Assessing the phenotypic
consequences of all genetic interactions amounts to an impossible numbers game. In order to prioritize certain variant
combinations, I will use model organisms with powerful genetics, namely the yeast S. cerevisiae and the worm C.
elegans, to identify and characterize genetic interactions with large impact on complex phenotypes. I propose three
projects that capitalize on our previous studies. These projects are united by their focus on genetic interactions (i.e.
epistasis), albeit they address different types of variant combinations and different mechanisms. The first project focuses
on rDNA, a highly variable repetitive DNA element. Variation in rDNA copy number impacts gene expression,
replication, genome stability, and mitochondrial abundance. Like other repetitive loci, rDNA is predisposed to interact
epistatically with other variants because of its high mutation rate. Using newly developed C. elegans mapping populations
and robotics-enabled phenotyping, our preliminary data show that rDNA copy number variation affects lifespan and
fitness through epistasis. High-throughput analyses of healthspan traits such as stress resistance and fertility are ongoing.
We will pursue fine-mapping of the most significant genomic loci implicated in epistasis with rDNA because their
identity, possibly DNA replication or repair genes, may point to the molecular mechanism by which rDNA variation
affects phenotype. In both yeast and worms, we will use the entire tool box of genetics and genomics to directly
interrogate the pathways by which rDNA copy number variation affects replication, genome stability, and mitochondrial
abundance. To enable accurate high-throughput measurements of rDNA copy number in model organisms and humans,
we will optimize a promising FISH technology. The second project relies on the detailed genotype–phenotype maps we
established for genes in the yeast mating pathway. Selecting single nucleotide variants of small and intermediate effects,
we will combine variants in two genes and test the combinations for mating efficiency while also perturbing strong
genetic modifiers and applying common stresses. To do so, we developed a sequencing strategy that allows us to
simultaneously phenotype tens of thousands of single nucleotide variant combinations between pairs of genes. The third
project will apply a technology of dominant negative polypeptides that we recently developed to identify at genome scale
protein interaction surfaces and their dynamics. In yeast, we will explore to what extent genetic interactions reflect direct
protein interactions. We will ask how easily (or not) protein interaction surfaces are perturbed by mutation, by
evolutionary divergence, or by drugs or stress that perturb protein folding. Together, the results of these three projects will
yield a broad and deep assessment of epistasis, testable hypotheses for human genetics and novel technologies for testing
them."

The epidemic of youth vaping is threatening the health and well-being of adolescents. The proposed project (“A
Multidisciplinary Assessment of Risks of Vaping in Early Life” - Project MARVEL) takes an integrated
multidisciplinary approach to assess the impact of youth vaping on health in collaboration with the system that
is most directly impacted by adolescent vaping and is well-positioned to intervene to reduce the potential
negative health impact - schools. To achieve this overarching goal, Project MARVEL brings together expertise
in adolescent development, addiction, tobacco regulatory science, longitudinal research methods, brain
development, respiratory health, biomarkers, multi-omics, biostatistics, community engagement, and health
communication. Project MARVEL includes four innovative and integrative projects that will determine the
impact of vaping on dependence and well-being (Project 1), brain health and cognitive and psychosocial
development (Project 2), and respiratory health (Project 3), and leverage this health information, along with the
extant literature to develop health communication messages focused on how vaping affects adolescents’
health and lives now (Project 4). These projects are supported by four cores that provide critical services
including: (1) administrative support; (2) biostatistical expertise; (3) facilitation with conducting research with
adolescents, including recruitment and retention; and (4) biomarkers of exposure/effect, and measurement of
product constituents, generated aerosols. Conducting the type of translational and participatory adolescent
research proposed in Project MARVEL is challenging. It requires oversight of large and complex projects and
cores, coordination between researchers; facilitation of scientific integration across different disciplines; and
the experience required to overcome many practical challenges to the successful implementation of scientific
protocols. The Administrative Core was designed to address each of these challenges through three specific
aims: 1) Manage operations including administrative, financial, and regulatory functions; 2) Facilitate scientific
discussion, and integration; 3) Coordinate dissemination of scientific findings. To address these aims, the
Administrative Core will oversee regular meetings, organize travel and reimbursements; provide budgetary
oversight for all projects and cores; and oversee human subjects’ protections, registration of clinical trials, and
the generation of reports. The Administrative Core will also organize regular discussion of topics related to
youth vaping through a monthly scientific seminar and an annual scientific retreat/external advisory board
meeting, support the development of scientific presentations, manuscripts, and submissions to the federal
docket, and implement policies for data sharing across the three research projects, as well as external to the
Program Project. Lastly, the Administrative Core will engage experts to serve on an External Advisory Board to
review the immediate and long-term goals of MARVEL, to monitor progress towards these goals, and to
provide input on study design study design, interpretation of results, and translational efforts."
10836416,"ABSTRACT – CORE 001: Biostatistics Core
The Biostatistics Core will provide the shared biostatistical services and data coordination necessary for this
Program Project. It will provide comprehensive support of the web-based surveys, lab-based studies, and the
randomized cluster health communication trial from study design, sampling, data collection, quality control, and
database management to biostatistical analysis and dissemination. Use of a centralized core will support the
overall conceptual framework for the Program Project, resulting in consistency in measurement and analysis
across studies and other cores. The Biostatistics Core draws upon the skills and expertise housed within the
Department of Biostatistics and Data Science in the Division of Public Health Sciences at Wake Forest School
of Medicine, a department with extensive experience serving as a data coordinating center for numerous multi-
center NIH-funded studies, and from the Biostatistics Shared Resource of the Wake Forest Baptist
Comprehensive Cancer Center. The mission of the Biostatistics Core is to provide a complete and well-
integrated infrastructure for the collection and analysis of study data, ensuring appropriate inferences are made
when disseminating results. The Aims of the core are to: 1) Provide statistical expertise on study design and
sample selection; 2) Perform data management activities including database creation, quality control,
integration, and sharing; and 3) Conduct statistical analyses and facilitate proper statistical inference from
appropriately prepared datasets. This centralized core will provide the technical skills necessary for the
collection of research data via web-based surveys and in-person laboratory procedures and will provide a
skilled team for the statistical analysis of these data sets. Through a coordinated collaboration between this
Core and each project, we will ensure an efficient means of collecting and analyzing data for all research
projects described in this proposal. The primary objectives of the Biostatistics Core are the provision of needed
biostatistical services, including design, sampling, data management, analysis, and dissemination."
10836420,"ABSTRACT – CORE 002: Adolescent Research Support Core
Conducting adolescent tobacco use research is inherently complex and logistically challenging. Researchers
must address complex issues with informed assent and parental consent, while considering stakeholder
interest in the dissemination of study findings when the research involves youth-serving organizations, such as
schools. Project MARVEL consists of a partnership with a large school district and four innovative projects
involving research with adolescent participants. A critical component in MARVEL’s implementation is
successfully facilitating the proposed research with a large number of adolescents from multiple schools and
maintaining participant engagement across projects over time. Addressing these implementation areas is the
focus of the Adolescent Research Support Core (ARSC). ARSC’s mission is to provide a centralized
infrastructure grounded in best practices for adolescent research, with input from stakeholders, to help each
project address the complexities associated with conducting adolescent research. This core will oversee the
critical functions of recruitment, enrollment, and retention for each project, facilitate participant confidentiality,
provide health and well-being resources for participants, and translate scientific findings into lay language for
non-academic audiences. The ARSC will use evidence-based approaches, such as community engagement,
to establish two advisory boards, one comprised of adolescents and one of key stakeholders. The boards will
provide input on school engagement, recruitment and retention of adolescent participants, participant
confidentiality, and translation of scientific findings. School engagement will be centrally managed by ARSC
and will include collaborating with a point-person at each high school to inform parents/guardians and students
about MARVEL; coordinating the implementation of two district-wide, in-class screener surveys; and
centralizing the process for obtaining district-level approvals for conducting the studies. The ARSC will
organize adolescent recruitment, enrollment, and retention activities. Importantly, the ARSC will implement
procedures to ensure protection of participant confidentiality and identify and address emotional and behavioral
concerns, if they arise during data collection. To maximize data collection efficiency and quality, the ARSC will
manage a team of study coordinators, allocated across projects based on project needs. Each laboratory
participant will be paired with a coordinator to provide a consistent point-person to minimize attrition. The
ARSC, led by a strong, multi-disciplinary team with extensive experience conducting research with adolescents
in schools and other community and laboratory settings, is a critical component of Project MARVEL. The
ARSC will collaborate with the other Cores to fully support the four research projects, coordinating essential
services to maximize efficiency while engaging community stakeholders and centrally managing school
engagement and the recruitment and retention of adolescent research participants."
10865014,"Microorganisms contend with a host of environmental threats, ranging from chemical toxins to dynamically
changing ionic conditions. In response, microbes have evolved a unique catalog of membrane transporters and
signaling proteins. My research program integrates cutting edge approaches in electrophysiology, membrane
protein biophysics, x-ray crystallography, and cryo-EM for the molecular and physiological characterization of
membrane proteins that contribute to uniquely microbial physiologies. Currently, three major areas of inquiry
are 1) molecular mechanisms for membrane export of environmental toxins 2) molecular mechanisms of
receptors that sense and integrate information about changing ionic gradients 3) development of new
approaches to overcome challenges in structural characterization of small membrane proteins. For the first line
of inquiry, we build off our identification and characterization of two previously unannotated microbial
physiologies, fluoride and guanidinium export. These ions are common in the microbial milieu and have broad-
spectrum inhibitory effects on microbial metabolism. We provided the first identification and mechanistic and
structural characterization of bacterial exporters of these toxins. Future efforts will focus on a) determining the
molecular mechanism and first structure of fluoride exporters of pathogenic eukaryotic microbes, known as
FEX. These studies will provide molecular information that can be applied to inhibitor design, as well as broad-
based insight into membrane protein evolution. b) biophysical analysis of guanidinium exporter Gdx. Together
with our recent structures, this project will reveal the mechanistic basis for promiscuous substrate recognition
and substrate-coupled conformational change, generating key insight into multidrug transport mechanisms
more generally. For the second line of research, we will establish molecular mechanisms of signaling proteins
that enact biofilm or virulence programs in response to changing ionic conditions. Our first target is a histidine
kinase receptor, KinC, that detects changes in environmental potassium. To understand the biophysical basis
for receptor activation, we will evaluate structural ensembles by cryoEM, employ site-directed mutagenesis and
in vivo assays for receptor activation, and reconstitute signaling function in lipid vesicles. This work will pioneer
biophysical research into ion-gradient-responsive signaling, with implications for pathogenic processes like
host colonization and biofilm growth. Our third major research thrust is to develop new approaches to
overcome challenges of structural characterization of small membrane proteins. We recently designed a new
and efficient approach to generate crystallization chaperones and cryo-EM fiducials, and we will continue to
develop this technology in order to make it accessible for as many membrane protein targets and labs as
possible. Together, these research activities will generate novel insights into fundamental questions in
membrane protein mechanism and microbial membrane physiology and pave the way for the development of
novel antibiotics and anti-biofilm agents targeting membrane export and signaling processes."
10839385,"Project Summary
 The proposed research will interrogate natural product scaffolds as starting points for narrow-spectrum and
antivirulence agents. Of specific interest are compounds that target specific bacteria and/or mitigate bacterial
biofilms, which play a role in the development of resistance in bacteria, the rejection of medical implants, and
many other health related diseases. The compounds which this proposal will focus on, have been chosen from
privileged areas where bacteria utilize chemical warfare to prevent colonization of invading species. Here we
present a multi-faceted approach, including organic synthesis, molecular genetics, proteomics, transcriptomics,
and microbiological assays that begins with these privileged scaffolds but has as an overarching goal of
developing next generation therapeutics and tool compounds to better understand processes within a
multispecies environment.
 We will interrogate the chemical synthesis of natural product scaffolds identified from nature that possess
species-specific activity, which is ideal for the development of “narrow-spectrum” therapeutics and tool
compounds. Proposed scaffolds are derived from plant material, fungi, and rhizosphere bacteria and have
previously demonstrated biological activity. We propose to leverage diverted total synthesis to construct both the
lead compound and hypothesis-driven analogs for biological evaluation.
 We will also characterize antivirulence compounds that inhibit biofilm formation. Starting with reported natural
products with biofilm inhibitory activity, we will explore the unique chemical features that endow each molecule
with their biological effect. Furthermore, we will utilize the chemical toolbox to design compounds with improved
chemical and physical properties to improve the likelihood of translation. Analogs will then be tested with the
goal of identifying specific processes that the natural product affects and allow for a broader evaluation of the
target in general biofilm processes.
 Finally, we will investigate both the biological target and properties of the tool compounds both in single
species and multispecies biofilms. This approach will employ a combination of genetic and MS-proteomic
techniques to develop a candidate list of proteins, from which we will identify the targets by biochemical studies.
Previous research has demonstrated that these sources have provided compounds with unprecedented
biological activity with significant implications to improving human health. Furthermore, they act on therapeutic
targets that were previously unknown providing new approaches to combat bacteria."
10818497,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and a leading cause of disability in adults. While aging is an important risk factor for the development of OA, the molecular mechanisms responsible for OA in the context of aging remain unclear. Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that DNA DSBs in articular chondrocytes promote cell cycle re-entry and induce both IKKBeta/NF-kappaB and IRF signaling downstream of STING to mediate a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype that leads to cartilage degeneration and inflammation in surrounding joint tissues. We show that IKKBeta/NF-kappaB signaling increases with age in the articular chondrocytes of wild type mice and that, by 24 months, these mice develop a knee joint phenotype exhibiting early hallmarks of OA. We also show that sustained IKKBeta activation in the chondrocytes of young mice greatly accelerates the onset of this age-related OA phenotype likely through paracrine actions on surrounding cells via a proinflammatory secretory program consisting of numerous cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and MMPs that can alter proliferation and viability of neighboring cells, remodel the cartilage ECM, and initiate an innate immune response. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are known to induce IKKBeta/NF-kappaB signaling and we provide evidence here of DNA DSBs in aged murine articular chondrocytes. We also provide gene expression data showing that IRF and Interferon signaling are among the most significantly affected pathways in aged articular chondrocytes. DNA DSBs can induce both NF-kappaB and IRF signaling through Stimulator of interferon genes, or STING. Thus, we hypothesize that STING may be upstream of both NF-kappaB and IRF to produce a proinflammatory secretory phenotype in chondrocytes with DSBs. In the first Aim of this proposal, we will test the effects of chondrocyte-specific DNA DSBs on chondrocyte function and OA development using AcanCreERT2/+; R26I-PpoI mice where DSBs are produced specifically in chondrocytes upon administration of tamoxifen. We will determine how chondrocytes respond to this genotoxic stress and also whether persistent DSBs are capable of promoting OA. In the second Aim, we will test whether STING is specifically involved in the activation of IKKBeta/NF-kappaB and IRF signaling following induction of DSBs and in the onset of age-related OA using in vitro cell culture methods as well as an in vivo STING knockout model in combination with NF-kappaB and IRF endogenous reporters. Results from these studies will provide valuable insight to the effects of DNA DSBs on chondrocyte fate and also on the identity of upstream activators of NF-kappaB in aged chondrocytes, potentially leading to the identification of a novel mechanism in which to inhibit IKKBeta/NF-kappaB signaling and inflammation in OA chondrocytes."

The proposed Utah Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) K12 career development training
program will build a foundation for junior investigators to achieve fulfilling careers in translational research by
preparing them for external career development or independent research awards. This application requests
support to build on the programmatic successes of our prior KL2 program by increasing the number of scholars
to 5, each for 2 to 3 years, and through innovative programming designed to maximize principles of
translational science. During the prior KL2 period, the program more than doubled in size, increased the K to R
transition from 17% to 50% and increased the number of Under-Represented in Medicine (URM) Scholars by
43%. The proposed leadership team is highly experienced and well-integrated in the CTSI through active
involvement in mentor training and the T32 and R25 programs. The team is also integrated with Module C1,
both as grant writing instructors in the formal degree program and in workshops for faculty seeking their first
R01. The proposed K12 aims to 1) recruit and support a diverse group of scholars, with particular emphasis on
attracting URM scholars and those with diverse career paths, 2) expand the K12 career development
curriculum to include training in translational science and research dissemination, and 3) maximize the
proportion of K12 scholars who achieve independent research support within 5 years of completing the training
award. The proposed K12 program focuses on supporting individualized training plans for scholars conducting
clinical and translational research (T1-T4) using the principles of translational science as well as purely
translational science projects. In addition to the 5 scholars supported by the K12, our career development
program will also include up to 6 additional scholars supported by CTSI partner institutions and supplemental
grants. Key programmatic elements include our highly successful Matrix Mentoring Model, interdisciplinary
mentoring teams, and guaranteed acceptance into a 2-year institutional program focused on training junior
investigators in career development, grant writing, management and leadership. Additional programmatic
elements include didactic training in implementation science with the opportunity to earn a certificate, mini-
immersions in translational research and science across the CTSI (clinical trial services, Biomedical
Informatics, biostatistics, epidemiology, research design, and community collaboration & engagement), twice
monthly K Club focusing on translational science and research ethics, and assorted research forums including
a quarterly virtual translational science roundtable, a collaboration with the University of Texas Health Science
Center at San Antonio’s CTSA. Our training opportunities are designed to ensure that scholars develop the
characteristics of clinical and translational researchers through novel curricular advancements that focus on
translational science and communication skills. The program’s aims are paired with measurable outcomes and
our evaluation team will use a results-based accountability and value engineering framework."
10823290,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the Biomedical Research Inclusion & Diversity to Grow Excellence in Science – Undergraduate
Program for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (BRIDGE UP-HBCU) is to build a translational
research workforce reflecting the talent pool of our diverse population by increasing the pool of talented Black
applicants for PhD and MD/PhD programs. This is especially important in the domain of translational science
and research. In fact, Black Americans have increased prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are
overly represented in the end stage renal disease populations, and have poorer outcomes for most cancers.
These stark health disparities demonstrate the key need for inclusion of Black biomedical scientists in all
domains of translational research and clinical care, since data support that racial concordance improves
patient outcomes and that diverse research teams foster innovation. The University of Utah CTSI is committed
to fortifying, sustaining and amplifying the STEM pipeline that trains and launches a diverse translational
research workforce. BRIDGE UP-HBCU will specifically address the leaks in the pipeline from undergraduate
to doctoral training of Black and other underrepresented scientists. BRIDGE UP-HBCU will recruit students
with an interest in translational research from partnership relationships with HBCUs, while expanding these
relationships to additional HBCUs. These students demonstrate a strong drive for doctoral research and
physician scientist research tracks and will benefit from exposure to the translational science spectrum,
additional research-intensive training experiences and professional development, enhancing both their
successful transition to top-tier doctoral and professional programs, as well as their long-term retention in the
translational research and science tracks. In order to accomplish these goals, BRIDGE UP-HBCU will provide
key proposed activities that include (1) holistic, culturally competent career-long mentor networks (2)
experiences to undertake hypothesis-driven research; (3) scientific and professional skill development
workshops and activities that hone strong oral and written communication skills, enhances their self-confidence
and authentic scientific identity, and instills successful strategies for applying to graduate school. Building on
institutional momentum and infrastructure at the University of Utah that is dedicated to supporting STEM
equity, diversity and inclusion, BRIDGE UP-HBCU will fortify its trainees’ critical thinking and research
experience, and develop a resilient mindset to persist in high-quality graduate programs and beyond. With
these additional skills, BRIDGE UP-HBCU graduates will be prepared for leadership and mentorship roles in
translational research career tracks."

The R25 Summer Research Program in PharmacoNeuroImmunology (PNI) provides 6 underrepresented
undergraduate students of diversity each year an intensive laboratory-based research experience to increase
their participation in biomedical graduate research programs. The R25 PNI program is a successful summer
program which has trained 16 undergraduate students of diversity to date (additional 6 coming in the summer of
2020). The summer research program stems from our well-established NIDA-funded T32 PNI training program,
which will provide engaged expert faculty mentors and a community of pre- and post-doctoral trainees to actively
train and mentor the summer students supporting the mission of the PNI summer program. There is a well-
recognized need to train biomedical scientists in an interdisciplinary and translational field that focuses on the
interactions of drugs of abuse with the nervous and immune systems, and integrates our understanding of these
physiological interactions with their behavioral counterparts. We will accomplish this by offering an intensive 10-
week research experience that will provide qualified undergraduate students of diversity the necessary academic
and research skills to ensure their competitiveness toward entering the next phases of their career - i.e., doctoral
programs or medical school. The PNI summer program is part of the comprehensive Life Science Undergraduate
Research Program (LSSURP) at the University of Minnesota. The PNI summer program is composed of an
intensive laboratory-based research experience that entails close interaction with and mentorship by a program
faculty member (n=31) that focuses on drug abuse research. This laboratory work is supplemented by a
comprehensive educational curriculum, which includes seminars by program faculty on topics in biomedical
research, ethics, and laboratory safety, and a focused student research poster symposium. An innovative
component of our PNI program proposal is to deliver education modules with small group discussion. In addition,
Dr. Jesse L. Mason, an alumnus of LSSURP and the T32 PNI training program, will provide a series of sessions
for PNI summer students targeted toward dealing with adversity as a diverse student. To support the goal of the
R25 Summer program, we propose two specific aims: 1) To provide an interdisciplinary structured research
experience in the area of PNI, especially as it pertains to drug abuse; and 2) To provide skill sets for graduate
careers in biomedical sciences. Those successful individuals will, in turn, act as role models for future students
interested in research careers. Three measures of evaluation will be collected on a yearly basis: 1) Assessment
of the 10 week summer research experience by participating undergraduate students and faculty in the program.
This assessment will come in two ways from the LSSURP survey and a PNI specific survey; 2) The PNI program
itself will be supported by the Advisory Committee to verify that we are meeting the goals of the program in
diversity recruitment and effective research experience; and 3) Outcome assessment of the students that were
in the program. We will track the careers in biomedical sciences of the past summer PNI trainees."
10841511,"T cells expressing the γδ TCR are the first to develop during human gestation and possess many 
features that make them uniquely suited to protection of the fetus and infant. Unlike conventional 
αβ T cells, γδ T cells recognize non-peptide antigens and can exhibit rapid, innate-like effector 
functions that are not dependent on prior antigen exposure nor on priming by dendritic cells, which 
are functionally immature in early life. A subset of γδ T cells (Vγ9Vδ2) respond to phosphoantigens 
produced by Plasmodium falciparum via a unique mode of presentation by ubiquitously expressed 
butyrophilin molecules. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells inhibit parasite replication in vitro and are associated
with protection from P. falciparum parasitemia in vivo. Remarkably, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells  that express a 
phosphoantigen-reactive γδ TCR and pre-programmed effector functions are already present in fetal 
blood at mid-gestation. These fetal Vγ9Vδ2 T cells have high inflammatory potential and can be 
rapidly activated to produce IFNγ and granzymes upon stimulation. In addition, they express 
semi-invariant TCRs with distinct sequence characteristics, including limited junctional diversity 
and differential gene segment usage,  that distinguish them from Vγ9Vδ2 T cells generated later in 
life. Given the intrinsic reactivity of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells to P. falciparum, we hypothesize that these 
cells may play a beneficial role as ready-made effectors during acute malaria infection of infants 
and young children, before an adaptive immune response has developed. We will use longitudinal 
samples previously collected from a large cohort of Ugandan infants, including cord blood 
mononuclear cells and infant PBMCs, to determine how Vγ9Vδ2 T cells respond to malaria antigen 
exposure in utero and during early childhood. In the first aim, we will characterize the expansion, 
differentiation, effector functions, and proliferative capacity of γδ T cells in infants following 
prenatal and postnatal malaria, enabling us to assess whether the Vγ9Vδ2 T cell response differs 
based on the timing of initial malaria exposure. In the second aim, we will evaluate the impact of 
malaria antigen exposure in utero and during early life on the γδ TCR sequence repertoire. This aim 
will incorporate single-cell sequencing technologies that pair transcriptomic information with TCR 
sequence data from individual cells, enabling us to resolve many potential sources of phenotypic 
and functional heterogeneity observed at the bulk cell analysis level. Lastly, Vγ9Vδ2 T cells have 
been shown to display APC-like capabilities including phagocytosis, antigen presentation, and even 
priming of naive T cells. Such functions may be of particular relevance during infancy, when 
professional APCs are immature and present antigen poorly. Therefore, in the third aim, we will 
investigate whether Vγ9Vδ2 T cells play additional roles in the fetus and neonate, beyond their 
immediate effector functions, including uptake and presentation of antigens to conventional αβ T 
cells and FcR-mediated recognition of opsonized antigens.
Together, these experiments will illuminate the functional capabilities of a unique semi-innate 
effector T cell population and its role in protection against malaria during early life."
10834204,"The Atherosclerosis Core (Core 3; C3) will be led by Dr. Edward Fisher and provide Program Project Grant
(PPG) investigators with three complementary approaches for analyzing atherosclerotic lesions, lesion
macrophages, and gene expression in myeloid cells and tissues investigated in the projects. First, C3 will
provide histological staining, immunohistochemistry, and quantification of atherosclerotic lesions. Second, it will
provide laser capture microdissection of macrophages and other types of cells in atherosclerotic lesions for
analysis of gene expression changes. Third, C3 will provide expertise in aortic digestion to obtain specific cell
compartments to provide samples to the NYU Genomic Technology Center (GTC) for RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analyses. These `omic' data will then undergo bioinformatic
analyses under Core 1, which will oversee Administration, Data Management, Biostatistics, and
Bioinformatics.By providing a central laboratory, C3 offers these services with optimal efficiency and cost-
effectiveness, avoiding the need for PPG investigators to maintain the required instrumentation in their own
laboratories or use expensive commercial services. By centralizing and standardizing procedures, C3 provides
a common set of analytical tools to enable a unified understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in
pathophysiologic processes of atherosclerosis and the biology of macrophages and endothelial cells. The
Specific Aims of C3 are: 1. To provide comprehensive tissue analysis and quantification of atherosclerotic
lesions; 2. To provide laser capture microdissection (LCM) of target cells, primarily macrophages, in
atherosclerotic lesions for gene expression studies; 3. To prepare aortic tissue (by digestion and FACS) to
provide samples to the GTC for RNA-seq and scRNA-seq (with the resulting data to be analyzed by Core 1)."
10834210,"ABSTRACT
The first steps in atherosclerosis are the transendothelial movement and subendothelial accumulation of
lipoprotein lipid. Endothelial cell (EC) transcytosis of LDL involves two receptors, scavenger receptor-BI (SR-BI)
and activin-like kinase 1 (ALK1). We showed that ECs also internalize undigested chylomicrons via SR-BI and
process them in lysosomes, leading to storage of some lipid as lipid droplets and the release of small extracellular
vesicles (sEVs) that cause lipid accumulation in macrophages. While many have considered chylomicrons as
non-atherogenic and too large to cross the EC barrier, this concept is now outdated with the understanding that
lipoprotein entry into the artery is a receptor-mediated process. The overall goal of Project 3 (P3) is to determine
how EC chylomicron uptake affects EC biology, delivers lipids to the artery, and accelerates atherosclerosis. In
Aim 1, we propose to determine how triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs) from the liver and intestines are
internalized and either processed within ECs or transcytosed. To do this, we will use mice with selective knockout
of liver and intestinal microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) obtained from Dr. Hussain (P1) to determine
lipoprotein characteristics that determine their interaction with SR-BI and ALK1. We will also determine how
lipoproteins created with liver FIT2 knockout (P2) affect EC inflammation and the production and composition of
EC released sEVs. Our preliminary data show that the N-terminal region of apoB has separate ligand binding
regions for ALK1 and SR-BI and this aim will determine why and how lipoprotein uptake via each of these
receptors affects ECs. In Aim 2, we propose in vivo studies to determine whether postprandial lipemia leads to
EC inflammation and whether the site of origin of these TRLs determines their effects on arterial ECs. We provide
preliminary data suggesting that chylomicrons that accumulate in lipoprotein lipase (LpL) deficient mice increase
atherosclerosis. We will use N-terminal fragments of apoB to reduce lipoprotein uptake into ECs to determine
role(s) of ALK1 and SR-BI in EC inflammation and atherosclerosis. Completion of the proposed studies promises
to alter our view of the relationship of chylomicrons to vascular disease, determine whether TRLs from liver and
intestine have similar effects on ECs, and define a novel approach to atherosclerosis prevention."
10895376,"Aortopathies are dangerous vascular diseases with no known therapy that can occur in different aortic regions
depending on genetic and environmental factors. Periaortic fat surrounding different regions of the aorta is
composed of different adipocyte and neuronal elements and has been reported to be associated with human
aortopathies. Preliminary data demonstrate levels of serotonin (5HT) in periaortic fat differ according to aortic
region, and similarly, there is differential expression of the 5HT3 receptor (Htr3) along the aortic length.
Infusion of angiotensin II (AngII), a well-known stimulus of regional aortopathies, was associated with
regulation of 5HT levels in thoracic brown periaortic, but not white abdominal periaortic fat, and AngII promoted
neuronal release of 5HT from thoracic aortic sections with adherent periaortic fat. Moreover, J774
macrophages responded to 5HT to promote inflammation and altered basal mitochondrial respiration through
an Htr3-mediated mechanism. Notably, administration of an Htr3 antagonist to AngII-infused mice abolished
regional aortopathies. We hypothesize that periaortic fat-derived 5HT acts at Htr3 on resident or recruited
macrophages within periaortic fat to promote aortic adventitial inflammation and stimulate mitochondrial
reactive oxygen species production, contributing to AngII-induced aortopathies. An ability of periaortic fat-
derived 5HT and macrophage Htr3 to influence the aortic adventitia is likely due to the absence of an anatomic
barrier. Moreover, we hypothesize that regional differences in periaortic fat-derived production of 5HT, its
regulation by AngII, and its ability to stimulate macrophage Htr3 contribute to regional differences in AngII-
induced aortopathies. Aim 1 will define the impact of regional differences in the synthesis of 5HT and its
regulation by AngII in periaortic fat on the regional development and progression of AngII-induced
aortopathies. Aim 2 will define mechanisms of macrophage Htr3 on regional development of AngII-induced
aortopathies and investigate mechanisms of 5HT/Htr3 to promote macrophage inflammation and mitochondrial
dysfunction. Results from these studies will identify a novel role for periaortic fat, through a 5HT/Htr3
mechanism, on regional aortopathy development and may identify new therapeutic targets optimized to
specific regional aortopathies."
10813799,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients diagnosed with advanced cancers typically required systemic therapies, which include chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. This proposal will address major issues affecting clinical outcomes; the
question of which patient will respond to which therapy, and the question of what factors are associated with
intrinsic or acquired resistance. Although intrinsic resistance can sometimes be clearly assigned to tumor-specific
factors, such as specific somatic mutations, in many cases the underlying basis for resistance is obscure. This
proposal will address the novel hypothesis that use of cannabidiol (CBD) provides an under-appreciated source
of variation in response to clinically important cancer therapies. A growing number of individuals use CBD during
cancer treatment to alleviate cancer pain, or even because of perceived benefits for treating their cancers. In the
past, there has been relatively limited study of CBD and other cannabis-derived phytochemicals due to issues
of social stigma and legal restrictions; however, a growing number of studies have generated convincing
evidence that CBD affects the growth of some types of tumors and interacts with cytotoxic chemotherapies to
modulate their activity. Some studies have demonstrated interaction between CBD cellular receptors and
signaling by EGFR, SRC, and other signaling proteins that are important therapeutic targets, implying CBD might
affect response to drugs targeting those proteins. However, no published studies in any cancer type have
systematically probed the interaction of CBD with the signaling pathways commonly targeted in cancer therapy.
In pilot studies, we have been investigating the interaction of CBD with 175 kinase-targeted inhibitors and
additional control compounds in restricting the growth of cancer cells. This has identified several specific CBD-
inhibitor interactions, which differed between two cell models tested, but were more notable in an EGFR-
dependent cell model. Given multiple connections identified between CBD and EGFR signaling detected, the
objective of this proposal is to evaluate the degree to which CBD influences the activity of pathway-targeted
inhibitors in two EGFR-dependent tumor types (head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and
colorectal cancer (CRC)), and to characterize the underlying mechanisms of CBD-inhibitor interaction. In Aim 1,
we will screen the targeted inhibitor library in additional HNSCC and CRC cell models to establish consistent
patterns of interaction, using CellTiterBlue and nuclear count as initial screening assays. Positive hits will be
further explored using clonogenic and 3D spheroid growth analysis, and dose range of interaction defined.
Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis will be used to establish signaling pathways specifically affected
by CBD-inhibitor interaction. In Aim 2, for selected specific protein-targeted inhibitors of interest, we will define
the CBD-inhibitor interaction in xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in vivo, confirm CBD-
dependent signaling changes defined in vitro pertain in vivo, and use bioinformatic analysis of large data
resources to understand the relationship between CBD receptor expression, prognosis, and drug response."

operational methods/tools. In TIN 2.0 we will further Develop new trial tools and methods for testing their ease
of implementation at CTSA hubs, Demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, and Disseminate broadly to
CTSA Hubs, by using case studies and didactics. We propose an integrated, coordinated, multi-stakeholder TIC
process to improve the efficiency and quality of multi-site trial initiation and subsequent execution by CTSA sites.
Our group of external collaborators will work as a sample of the larger CTSA-TIN consortium to develop Hub
implementation and dissemination approaches on both a case- and consortium-wide basis. The JHU TIC will
leverage operational activities in CTSA trials implementation to study novel operational innovations that improve
participant engagement, intervention adherence and measurement of trial endpoints. We will measure benefits
using explicit efficiency- and quality-focused metrics to test these innovations. The scientific purpose of our
team’s efforts will be to demonstrate that TIC innovations in trial design, execution, and evaluation can lead to
better trial performance, including faster start-up, faster completion, greater protocol compliance and more
precise endpoints. We will disseminate results of validated CTSA-TIN innovations produced from consortia trials
to CTSA Hub clinical trial teams and research trainees. We will collaborate with NCATS to utilize the platform
demonstrated in TIN 1.0 to engage and equip a multisite randomized clinical trial workforce through the CTSA
Hubs to perform trials faster and at a higher quality in TIN 2.0."
10821466,"ABSTRACT – Computational Immunobiology Core
The Computational Immunobiology Core (CIC) will provide comprehensive technical assay support services
and analytic support for the hypothesis-driven research studies proposed in the two Projects comprising this
U19 proposal. The Core derives its greatest overall strength from its intersection of technical and transplant-
specific expertise, state-of-the art methods for multidimensional biological interrogation, and explicit proficiency
in advanced computational analytics. Led by Dr. Kirk, the Core continues to utilize the longstanding assets of
prior iterations of this program to achieve comprehensive characterization of transplant procedures, with
particular expertise in polychromic flow cytometry-based platforms for immune profiling. Assay testing is
performed in a Good Clinical Laboratory compliant environment according to highly standardized and validated
Standard Operating Procedures, by a team that has been supporting NHP transplant work for over 25 years.
To this established team, a new collaboration has been forged with NC State University, an international leader
in veterinary medicine, to incorporate a novel platform for comprehensive, rhesus macaque-specific, single cell
RNA sequence analysis. This is the first lab to comprehensively provide RNA sequence analysis for the entire
TCR and BCR repertoire in the rhesus macaque, and as such, adds unprecedented granularity to the analysis
of the in vivo studies proposed in the two Projects. Given the exponential growth in data acquired from these
capabilities, new expertise in high-density data analytics has been added through the recruitment of Drs. Peng
and Chan. These individuals have extensive expertise in the integration of sequence- and flow-based datasets
with traditional metrics of clinical outcome, specifically in nonhuman primate studies. The key services the CIC
will provide to Projects 1 and 2 include: 1) state-of-the-art specimen capture, processing, and biobanking; 2)
analytical polychromatic flow cytometry phenotyping and intracellular cytokine staining; 3) single cell RNA
sequencing; 4) quantitative virologic testing; 5) comprehensive histology and immunohistochemistry support;
and 6) computational analysis for the data emerging from the assays. The present core facilities house all the
advanced equipment required for turn-key assessment of the proposed primate studies, including exceptional
flow and sequencing platforms, and a specimen processing and biobanking service that serves the entire Duke
community under Dr. Kirk’s supervision. The established viral testing facility monitors three of the most
clinically relevant viruses in transplantation: Rhesus Cytomegalovirus (rhCMV), Rhesus Lymphocryptovirus
(rhLCV) (rhesus homology of EBV), and Simian Virus 40 (SV40). The CIC also provides routine histology and
immunohistochemistry assays through our immunohistochemistry service laboratory, allowing each project to
examine the effects of the experimental manipulations on key donor and host tissues. The juxtaposition of
human and NHP expertise represents a particular strength of this IPC consortium, further facilitating the highly
translational aspects of the proposed studies."
10821468,"ABSTRACT – Project 2
Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for end-stage renal failure due to improved patient survival,
quality of life, and healthcare costs compared to dialysis. However, sensitized patients with preformed human
leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies due to prior exposure to allogeneic HLA via transfusion, pregnancy, and
previous transplantation face lower rates of transplantation that result in higher waitlist mortality. Furthermore,
even if these patients are transplanted after desensitization, they frequently have worse short- and long-term
graft survival compared to non-sensitized patients due to increased risk of rejection. We have shown that a
combination of plasma cell targeting with proteasome inhibitor (carfilzomib) and co-stimulation blockade with
belatacept reduces preformed antibody prior to kidney transplantation in sensitized nonhuman primates (NHP).
Together with cytolytic induction, this pharmacological desensitization prevented early antibody-mediated
rejection (AMR) and significantly prolonged graft survival in sensitized recipients. However, the peri-transplant
desensitization was not able to control late AMR. Interestingly, post-transplant belatacept was able to suppress
donor-specific antibody (DSA), disrupt germinal centers, and prevent plasma cell increase in NHP following
depletion. This approachachievedprolonged graft survival with less AMR but promoted significant complications
including viral reactivation and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). We hypothesize that the
more specific (and even donor-specific) targeting of humoral responses including B cells, plasma cells, and
complement may better control post-transplant AMR in sensitized hosts and create a therapeutic window to
induce donor-specific tolerance. We will evaluate guided homeostatic repopulation with apoptotic donor cells for
re-establishing an immune repertoire that favors transplantation tolerance. To explore this hypothesis, we
propose 3 specific aims: 1) To evaluate adjuvant therapies targeting down-stream post-transplant humoral
responses following desensitization. 2) To determine efficacy of antigen-specific pro-tolerant approaches in
highly sensitized NHPs recipients. 3) To identify the functional phenotype of allo-specific T and B cell repertoires
required to establish tolerance in sensitized recipients."

The University of Minnesota (UMN) CTSI is ideally positioned to implement and train multidisciplinary teams of
translational researchers from the 6 health science schools and colleges (Medicine, Public Health, Nursing,
Pharmacy, Dentistry, Veterinary Medicine), the broader University, and 2 major Twin City Hub Partners: the
Minneapolis VA Medical Center and Hennepin Healthcare. The UMN CTSI K12 Program will train highly
promising and diverse research-oriented Assistant Professors in clinical and translational science (CTS) using
multidisciplinary mentoring teams to advance their individual research projects and CTS skill sets. K12
Scholars will be trained for 3 years, including 2 years with NCATS K12 funding and 1 year of UMN support,
with access to some career development activities and mentoring beyond 3 years. This grant will support 6
NCATS-funded Scholars at a time. The Program will 1) provide rigorous, competency-based training in the
design and conduct of high-quality clinical and translational research with both required and individualized
components (including Responsible Conduct of Research, Reproducibility and Rigor, and Human Subjects and
Animal Protections); 2) ensure K12 Scholars acquire skills and experience in team science and community
engagement; 3) promote scientific and career development, including training K12 Scholars to be excellent
mentors, communicators, and leaders and offering experiential learning opportunities; and 4) support each K12
Scholar’s development of a productive translational research program, resulting in successful K and R01 grant
applications and transition to independence. This program builds on the current KL2 program and our
innovations in leadership and communications training, such as using personality assessments and optional
coaching to aid Scholars’ personal development. Planned enhancements include required training in data
health science with development of a new foundational course; augmented evaluation of mentoring
effectiveness; increased interactions with community and stakeholders, including a Community Mentoring
Program; increased education in dissemination and implementation science; and using Scholar portfolios to
demonstrate acquisition of the characteristics of translational scientists. We will expand the diversity of our
Community of Scholars through holistic review of K12 applicants and close interactions and near-peer
mentoring with special programs (Pre-K Discovery Scholars and Medical School Early Research Career
Awards). We will also augment our Scholars’ interactions with programs that introduce college and precollege
students, mainly from disadvantaged and underrepresented communities, to the health sciences. With these
innovations and activities in place and with robust institutional support, we expect our K12 Scholars to become
highly talented leaders in their fields, contributing to multidisciplinary investigations, disseminating their
research and expertise through multiple channels, and mentoring new generations of CTS researchers."
10839846,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of my research project is to understand how the dynamic behavior of human G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) drives the assembly of GPCR complexes with drugs and partner signaling proteins at a
single-molecule level. GPCRs are sensory membrane proteins that recognize a wide array of hormones, drugs,
and neurotransmitters, representing the largest class of proteins targeted by FDA-approved therapeutics. The
energy landscape of GPCRs is complex and populated by multiple conformers with distinct functions and
structures. While the structures of some GPCR conformers have been characterized by x-ray crystallography
and cryo-EM, the lifetimes of these different conformations and their rates of exchange are mostly unknown. We
aim to map the energy landscape of GPCR complexes using single-molecule fluorescence (SMF), which enables
the investigation of GPCR dynamics in real-time and in environments that recapitulate the cellular milieu. In the
long term, we aim to apply this information to improve our understanding of how disease-associated mutations
alter these energy landscapes, which may ultimately guide the design of new therapeutics. This proposal aims
to apply SMF to map the energy landscapes of two human GPCRs. First, we will investigate the conformational
dynamics of a representative class A human GPCR, the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR). A2AAR provides an
important benchmark for single-molecule fluorescence studies and will enable us to compare our experimental
measurements of dynamics to computational predictions. Our studies will reveal both similarities and differences
in mechanisms of signaling between different class A GPCRs and will also show for the first time how lipids in
the bilayer membrane can act as allosteric modulators of GPCR function. In the second direction, we will use
SMF to study the conformational dynamics of the human glucagon receptor (GCGR). GCGR is a hormone-
binding class B GPCR that is activated by one of the central metabolites, glucagon. GCGR is critical to glucose
homeostasis and is a validated drug target for type 2 diabetes therapy. Crystal and cryo-EM structures of GCGR
have shown that the large extracellular domains appear to act in concert with the transmembrane domain to bind
hormones and small molecules, but the dynamics of ligand binding are as yet not understood. Our studies of
GCGR will reveal in real-time the mechanisms of ligand recognition by the extracellular domain and quantify
function-related dynamic fluctuations of the transmembrane domains. These studies will allow us to compare
the dynamics of complex formation with hormones and with small molecules to understand the role of the
extracellular domain in ligand recognition. This will help us understand how ligands with different chemical
structures and pharmacological efficacies affect the receptor activation pathways and will ultimately aid in the
design and screening of GPCR-targeted drugs with tailored pharmacological responses."
10824313,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) and death
from CVD is the leading cause of graft loss. KTRs demonstrate abnormal endothelium-dependent dilation
(EDD) and large artery stiffness, key pathophysiological antecedents to the development of CVD. Acid
retention is a common feature of patients who have received a kidney transplant. KTRs have a single kidney
and a decreased number of nephrons leading to an inability to excrete the daily dietary acid load. Additionally,
KTRs receive several medications that can result in acid retention including calcineurin inhibitors. Acid
retention results in increased ammoniagenesis leading to activation of the alternative complement pathway.
Activation of the alternative complement pathway increases inflammatory factors, collagen deposition and
endothelial inflammation contributing to tubulointerstitial damage and vascular dysfunction. We show that
complement activation fragments are increased in KTRs compared to healthy controls and are inversely
correlated with eGFR and EDD. Lower serum bicarbonate levels, even within the normal laboratory range, in
KTRs are associated with an increased risk of graft loss, cardiovascular events and mortality. Small
interventional trials have shown that treatment with alkali therapy slows progression of kidney disease, even in
patients with normal serum bicarbonate levels. In our preliminary data, alkali therapy improved vascular
endothelial function in 20 patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3-4. Because acid retention is common in
KTRs, it is plausible that alkali therapy in KTRs may also result in improved vascular and graft function. In our
preliminary data, we show in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover safety and feasibility
study that sodium bicarbonate therapy is safe and feasible in KTRs and there is a trend towards improved
EDD. We are proposing a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, 12 month study in 120 KTRs to
examine the effect of sodium bicarbonate therapy on surrogate markers of CVD and graft function. Our overall
hypothesis is that treatment with bicarbonate will improve indicators of vascular and graft function in KTRs by
decreasing complement activation. In Aim 1, we will compare changes over time in brachial artery flow-
mediated dilation and arterial stiffness, measured by aortic pulse wave velocity, before and after 12 months of
sodium bicarbonate therapy or placebo. In Aim 2, we will compare changes over time in tubular atrophy and
interstitial fibrosis in kidney biopsies before and after 12 months of sodium bicarbonate therapy or placebo. In
Aim 3, we will examine changes in plasma and urine complement activation fragments (Ba and sC5b-9) and
complement deposition in kidney tissue before and after 12 months of sodium bicarbonate therapy or placebo.
The results of this novel study have the potential to inform clinical practice by providing the necessary evidence
to establish sodium bicarbonate therapy as an inexpensive and easy to administer option for the treatment of
vascular dysfunction and graft function in KTRs."
10817813,"Summary
Accurate transmission of the genetic information requires complete duplication of the chromosomal DNA each
cell division cycle. It is now clear that replication forks stall frequently as a result of encounters between the
replication machinery and template damage, slow-moving or paused transcription complexes [TC(s)],
unrelieved positive superhelical tension, covalent protein-DNA complexes, and as a component of cellular
stress responses. Stalled forks are foci for genomic instability that causes genetic alterations and can give rise
to cancer. Stalled forks must be protected/remodeled/repaired and replication restarted/continued in order to
maintain genomic stability.
 We propose to continue our analyses of replication fork stalling brought about by such factors. We ask:
(i) Are replisome collisions with protein-bound R-loops more prone to stall forks than collisions with unbound R-
loops? which are only transient obstacles to progression. (ii) Does replication fork reversal preserve replication
potential during replication-transcription conflicts? (iii) Does the accumulation of positive superhelicity between
replisomes and TCs approaching each other head-on lead to replication fork stalling and/or collapse? And (iv),
how do replisomes overcome collisions with RNA polymerases that are themselves stalled by DNA template
damage?
 We have used the MIRA mechanism to begin to transit our focus on bacterial replication systems to
replication with human proteins. We will investigate the DNA sequence requirements for loading of double
hexamers of the MCM proteins to DNA, as well as the effect of chromatinization of the DNA substrate on the
loading reaction. We ask: (i) what are the requirements for various amino acid sequence motifs in ORC1? (ii)
What role is played by ORC6 (we currently do not require this protein for loading)? And (iii) what are the effects
of histone modifications in the loading reaction? We are also proceeding to reconstitute the complete
replication reaction with purified human replication proteins. Such a system will afford unprecedented insight
into insults to replication fork progression and cellular stress responses.
 Coordinating the structural organization of chromosomes is essential for DNA replication, transcription,
and chromosome segregation during cell division. Failure to achieve proper chromosomal organization during
separation can result in DNA breakage, leading to an uneven distribution of the genetic material to the next
generation. We propose to continue our analyses of the mechanisms by which the bacterial condensin
MukBEF and the cellular decatenase topoisomerase IV cooperate to promote proper chromosome compaction
and segregation. We ask: (i) Does the MukBEF complex either translocate on or extrude loops of DNA? And
(ii) how does replication proceed through topological domains generated by MukB and Topo IV?"
10833096,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intermediate metabolism must be finely tuned, carefully balanced, and robustly adaptable to changes in envi-
ronmental conditions. While the individual enzymes that drive most metabolic processes are well understood,
only have we appreciated the widespread role of metabolic enzyme assemblies in metabolic organization and
control. In particular, two types of structures, metabolic filaments that assemble from single enzyme types, and
metabolons that co-assemble multiple enzymes in single pathways, provide important mechanisms for regulating
enzyme activity and metabolic flux. Both filaments and metabolons assemble dynamically in cells, and alter the
functions of the constituent enzymes to adapt to metabolic demand. This proposal builds on recent successes
from our group describing the molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of enzyme assembly in mul-
tiple systems, including nucleotide biosynthesis, energy metabolism, and amino acid regulation. Recent work,
including our own published and preliminary data, shows that enzyme assembly is a general mechanism of
control, and that assembly itself is controlled by cells in multiple ways, including by the levels of specific metab-
olites, by posttranslational modification, by expression of splice variants that alter polymerization characteristics,
and by interaction with regulatory proteins. We use in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy to deter-
mine the structural basis for assembly and regulation, coupled with biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological
techniques in an integrative approach to understanding the functions of metabolic assemblies. This work will
provide insight into the specific roles assembly plays in modulating the function of multiple enzymes, and illumi-
nate general principles of metabolic control."
10840440,"The Coordinating Center (CC) for the Older Americans Independence Centers (OAIC) Program plans, initiates,
facilitates, and coordinates activities that maximize OAIC collaborations. Our guiding philosophy is to focus on
activities that promise high impact but would be difficult for individual OAICs to achieve on their own, and which
result in collaborations that unlock synergy, thereby making the whole (the OAIC program) greater than its
parts (the individual centers and investigators). Our preliminary data show that the present cycle has been the
most successful and productive to date. The proposed new cycle will build on and extend these
accomplishments with initiatives embedded in the following four Specific Aims, which were informed by our
preliminary data, including our evaluation processes and our structured interviews with three key groups of
stakeholders: directors of all 15 OAICs, a panel of early career investigators, and NIA program officials.
Specific Aim 1. Enhance communications and coordination within the OAIC program and with the greater
aging research community. Specific Aim 2. Facilitate and promote OAIC-themed collaborative research.
Specific Aim 3. Enhance the development of the next generation of researchers in aging. Specific Aim 4.
Accelerate implementation of key OAIC research findings into member health care systems and their
communities. We will achieve these aims by capitalizing on: 1) our 17 years of experience and earned trust in
progressively building collaborations; 2) an expanded, multi-disciplinary, cohesive, multi-institutional team of
experienced leaders with complementary skills and well-defined roles; 3) our well established processes,
including four working groups and inclusion of key stakeholders; 4) regular input and guidance from the OAIC
Directors Committee and NIA program officials; and 5) continously evaluating progress toward each aim and
overall goals of the program. This proposed renewal of the CC will further increase the breadth and depth of
OAIC collaboration, provide vital new research opportunities, particularly for early career investigators, promote
career development of new investigators, and disseminate key OAIC research findings to improve the
healthcare of older Americans."
10849668,"TREATMENT DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
Digital therapeutics hold great promise in overcoming the substantial challenges in accessing high quality,
empirically supported treatments for substance use disorders (SUDs) and co-occurring mental or physical
health conditions (CODs). Digital innovations can enhance the potency of existing interventions, extend their
reach, and reduce costs. Digital biomarkers from behavioral and physiological monitoring using smartphones
and wearable sensors (i.e., passive sensing) can improve specificity of assessment processes that in turn can
provide personalized targets to optimize interventions. Supporting the development of digital therapeutics is
vital, as most persons with SUDs do not receive SUD treatment, and of those who do receive treatment, only a
minority of treatments are evidence-based. Over the past 9 years, the Treatment Development and Evaluation
(TDE) Core has supported activities that enhance and expedite research on an array of technologies that can
improve treatment delivery. Our Core affiliates’ research has advanced the feasibility, acceptability, usability,
and efficacy of innovative digital health assessment tools and interventions for multiple types of SUDs among
diverse populations. These projects have also improved our understanding of developmental, and maintaining
factors, and mechanisms of change for SUDs. In the proposed renewal period, the TDE Core will continue to
enhance the quality, efficiency, and impact of research projects among an interdisciplinary expert faculty. The
Core will continue with, and expand activities for, sharing resources among CTBH affiliates and the greater
scientific and clinical communities (Aim 1), and provide mechanisms to support the acceleration and
accumulation of science that will enhance our understanding of factors that can optimize digital therapeutics for
SUDs and CODs (Aim 2). These efforts will embrace the 5 new CTBH priorities (e.g., scaling of digital
therapeutics, digital measurement to inform personalized just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs),
integration of CODs and transdiagnostic mechanisms and interventions, digital health ethics, and inclusion of
underrepresented minority populations). For example, we will enhance our consultation services for preparing
competitive grant applications by expanding the array of Advisors with expertise in the priority areas, and will
refine the focus and enhance the intensity of our educational activities by developing and delivering webinars,
tutorials, and cross-Core workshops that provide in-depth training on high priority research targets. The Core
will also engage affiliates with active or pending digital health projects to include additional research aims that
address our new priorities. e.g., add common metrics of outcomes related to scaling, mechanisms of change,
or transdiagnostic processes; include passive sensing assessment to collect digital phenotyping data that may
relate to substance use or relapse; and assess CODs in SUD projects to evaluate how they moderate
intervention effects and how transdiagnostic interventions impact outcomes. These efforts will accelerate the
state-of-the science of digital therapeutics for SUDs and related conditions across diverse populations."
10849675,"DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
Digital therapeutics have demonstrated potential to meet service needs and accelerate translation of science to
practice. The charge of the Dissemination and Implementation (D&I) Core is to provide education, training,
resources, and scientific guidance to advance implementation science and practice for digital therapeutics for
SUDs and CODs. Over the past nine years, the D&I Core has supported activities to promote awareness about
the science of digital therapeutics for SUDs and CODs through traditional and digital dissemination channels
and developed resources to support application of implementation science in digital therapeutic research. Core
affiliates have advanced a conceptual understanding of how implementation science can be applied to digital
therapeutic research and contributed to the knowledge base of facilitators and barriers to implementation of
digital therapeutics for SUDs across a range of populations and settings. In this renewal, the Core will
continue to promote awareness about the science of digital therapeutics (Aim 1) through education,
mentorship, and expansion of the CTBH digital platform features to promote cumulative knowledge about
clinical evidence for digital therapeutics for SUDs and CODs. As new activities, D&I will work with the Center’s
Stakeholder Advisory Board to identify the stakeholder information priorities to inform targeted dissemination
strategies and will add a feature to the CTBH website to advance cumulative knowledge about digital
therapeutic implementation research. The D&I Core will support adoption and implementation of digital
therapeutics (Aim 2) through expanding and refining resources to promote application of implementation
science in digital therapeutic research, including implementation case studies and a common implementation
measurement framework. New in this renewal, the Core will conduct activities to systematically specify
strategies that accelerate implementation of digital therapeutics and offer tutorials to foster actionable skills for
digital therapeutic implementation research. To support new Center priorities, the Core will also engage
affiliates with active later stage digital health projects to include common clinical and implementation metrics to
inform methods for scaling of digital therapeutics, contribute training and methods for use of digital therapeutic
usage data and other digital assessment in studies to elucidate implementation mechanisms of action and
inform adaptive interventions, promote scientific understanding of determinants and strategies associated with
implementation of transdiagnostic digital treatments, provide training and resources in digital health ethics with
regard to access equity and cultural relevance of digital therapeutics, and support training and methods to
increase representation of underrepresented populations in digital therapeutic research. These efforts will
advance the state of implementation science and practice for digital therapeutics for SUDs and CODs."
10849680,"EMERGING TECHNOLOGY AND DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT SUMMARY
The science of behavioral health, and the development of effective interventions in behavioral health, are
increasingly supported by a range of technologies – from sensors that measure physiological conditions and
contextual factors, to algorithms that infer (and predict) an individual’s receptivity to an intervention in the
moment, to analytics that infer behavioral characteristics or individual phenotypes, to real-time classifiers that
drive just-in-time adaptive interventions, to analytic methods to statistically understand multimodal datasets, to
visualizations that sift through terabytes of sensor data, to user-centric design processes that lead to novel
interfaces that are acceptable and usable. Faculty affiliated with the CTBH Emerging Technologies and Data
Analytics Core (ETDA Core), which launched in the last P30 renewal period, have the expertise to address all
these components in this spectrum of foundational technologies.
In this P30 Center renewal application, the ETDA Core will enhance educational and research opportunities
focused on the application of emerging technologies and data analytics to the development and evaluation of
digital therapeutics. The Core will continue our current activities, including expanding the ETDA Core
community, promoting reciprocal learning, assisting with the seminar series, supporting the shared resources
developed during the current P30 period, providing expert consulting, and engaging with the Pilot Core to
sponsor Pilot RFAs that encourage and enable collaborations between ETDA-Core affiliates and CTBH
behavioral scientists. And, the Core will launch new activities, including hosting a tutorial series, contributing to
several research cross-Core workshops, sponsoring a trainee lunch series, expanding its expert consulting,
expanding industry partnerships, expanding international collaborations, addressing challenges of scale,
supporting research aimed at personalized interventions, supporting research on transdiagnostic mechanisms
and interventions, supporting activities related to digital ethics, and expanding efforts to increase inclusion of
underrepresented populations.
The ETDA Core will also support shared resources among our interdisciplinary Center team to enhance the
pace of development, and resulting potency, of digital therapeutics. To this end, the Core will maintain and
expand its pool of shared hardware, maintain and expand its set of group licenses for specialized software,
maintain and refine its home-grown software libraries, develop guidelines and best practices for effective user-
centered design of behavioral interventions, seek permission to obtain and share data sets, and further
develop its staff’s expertise in the creation and management of technology fundamental to operating robust
and scalable behavioral-health studies."

 The Pilot Project Core of the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH) aims to support
novel pilot projects that offer considerable promise to have a large impact on the field, as part of the Center’s
activities to support the development and evaluation of cutting-edge applications of technology to the treatment
of substance use disorders. Since the initial funding period over the past 9 years, the Pilot Core awarded 32
innovative pilots (on a competitive basis based on blinded peer-review modeled after the NIH review process).
The projects resulted from 14 Requests for Applications (1-2 per year) that included a combination of open
investigator-initiated project solicitations and targeted Requests for Applications (RFAs) focused on
collaborative projects bringing together teams with expertise from diverse research disciplines to address
topics with key relevance to substance use including behavioral health, computer science, engineering, data
science, and User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) design. Among these awards, the Pilot Core has
awarded 11 pilot grants to post-doctoral level trainees, 3 pilot grants to Instructor level researchers, and 5 pilot
grants to Assistant Professor level junior faculty, supporting the CTBH mission to train future scientists in
digital health approaches to substance use. To date the pilot grants have made significant contributions to the
scientific literature, resulting in 25 peer reviewed publications, and over 20 funded research grants (18 of which
were specifically related to substance use), including 2 NIH Ks, a CTN study, NIH R34, R42 and R01 grants,
as well as PCORI, NIDILRR, SAMHSA, foundation and CDC grants.
 In this second renewal phase of the CTBH P30, the Pilot Core plans to support an average of 3-4 pilot
projects per year to continue to fund the development of a “pipeline” of new areas of research that could then
progress to more rigorous empirical testing via external funding mechanisms after the pilot phase. We plan to
continue a targeted RFA process to seed innovation in areas consistent with the scientific aims of this P30. In
this process, approximately 50% of the pilot funding opportunities will continue to be Investigator-initiated. And,
about 50% of pilots will be supported in response to specific RFAs on timely and understudied issues that offer
great promise to advance the field, including continued support of collaborations between technology and
behavioral health experts and support of pilots in CTBH’s new priority areas. Consistent with our efforts to
increase the diversity of the scientific community of researchers focused on substance use, we are also
committed to increasing applications from underrepresented minority applicants. All awards will be made
available on a competitive basis to support pilot projects by diverse research teams affiliated with CTBH. The
Pilot Core Director will advise recipients of pilot project funds on optimal next steps in seeking extramural
funding to support a line of research that builds on pilot study results."

 The Data Science (DS) Core serves as a centralized resource for providing expert and timely bioinformatics
and other DS-related consulting, analysis, collaborative research, management, and training solutions for a
broad range of high-throughput biomedical data. The DS Core will support the specific aims of HI-INBRE V by
providing a strong and integrated DS service in research, education, investigation, and creation of innovative
methodologies.
 During INBRE IV, the Bioinformatics Core made substantial progress to serve as a solid foundation for
transition to the DS Core. We experienced an annual increase in the number of researchers utilizing the DS Core
services from almost all the HI-INBRE institutions. The DS Core has successfully provided
bioinformatics/biostatistics and other DS training and education opportunities to the HI-INBRE community.
During INBRE IV, the core infrastructure was also significantly enhanced and several Ph.D. level data scientists
were hired. The core has successfully contributed to peer-reviewed publications, grant applications and helped
investigators to obtain a variety of research awards.
 In INBRE V, the DS Core will continue to function as an important component of the network. Specifically,
the DS Core will contribute to INBRE V objectives in three key ways: (i) Customized Services: the DS Core will
facilitate the acquisition of preliminary data for grant applications and subsequent research by HI-INBRE
investigators via consultation on experimental design and data management as well as offer expertise in data
analysis and interpretation; (ii) Education and Training: the DS Core will provide education in DS, as well as
support career development for student and emerging faculty researchers, with special attention given for
training DS skills to undergraduate students; (iii) Core Development: the DS Core will create tools and methods
or repurpose existing tools and strategies to accelerate advances in the sciences. In all of these activities, the
DS Core will work collaboratively with other local and national bioinformatics and DS cores. To reach these
goals, we propose three Specific Aims:
 (1) Provide DS core services to support biomedical research needs of HI-INBRE investigators.
 (2) Meet the upskilling needs of biomedical faculty whose research is becoming increasing computationally
intensive.
 (3) Enhance the biomedical DS pipeline in Hawaii.

10847394,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Across many species, the evolutionary processes that underlie genetic variation are structured by the
geographical distribution of individuals and how geography impacts patterns of reproduction and dispersal.
In human genetics, geographic patterning in allele frequencies has important practical consequences for
genome-wide association studies, as it can produce a type of confounding with other spatially varying factors
impacting traits. It also has relevance for the discovery of rare loss-of-function variant carriers. In infectious
disease, the arrival and spread of novel adaptive variants is mediated by geographic dispersal patterns.
 In this project, we will develop theory, methods, and resources that incorporate an explicitly geographic
component. In the first research area, we will develop new theoretical models for investigating the impacts
of varying spatial sampling strategies on the detection of deleterious alleles, such as loss-of-function alleles.
We will also study the spread of advantageous alleles in populations with super-spreaders and long-distance
dispersal, as well as graph-based dispersal dynamics, in a series of analyses that is relevant for
understanding the spread of adaptive variants in human-dispersed pathogens. In the second research area,
we will expand a set of methods for understanding spatial structure in genetic data. Specifically, we hope to
build models that more accurately capture directional and long-distance migration. In the third research area,
we will continue to maintain and develop resources for visualizing geographic distributions in allele
frequencies. These three research areas are synergistic and ideally will help advance our understanding of
genetic variation in numerous species, including humans."

current outbreak still needs to be conducted, but in the SARS coronavirus outbreak, gram-negative bacteria
were the most common source of the hospital-acquired infections. Gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas
aeruginosa have few effective treatments, making any resistant strains particularly difficult to treat. Cationic
antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) like colistin are currently used as last line therapies to treat infections with
multidrug-resistant strains, however, colistin-resistant strains are increasingly encountered. P. aeruginosa
becomes resistant to CAPs by modifying the lipids of its outer membrane to reduce the net negative charge.
Without the favorable electrostatic interaction between the positively-charged CAP and the negatively-
charged bacterial outer membrane, the antibiotic cannot enter and kill the bacterium. Our goal is to develop
and characterize inhibitors of the CAP-resistance pathway in the bacterium. If the outer membrane remains
negatively charged, the CAP should continue to work. The inhibitors could be used as an adjuvant in a
combination therapy along with a CAP to treat resistant infections.
 In the first funding period, we identified a suite of compounds that act as antibiotic adjuvants, potentiating
susceptibility to colistin. In the current work, we propose to characterize the efficacy of the combination
treatment (Aim 1). We will investigate activity toward biofilms, resistant strains, and under resistance-
inducing conditions. The kinetics of killing and the development of resistance will also be studied. Our current
hypothesis is that the antibiotic adjuvant acts by inhibition of ArnA, a key bifunctional biosynthetic enzyme of
the lipid modification pathway. We will study the adjuvant’s effects on the ArnA-mediated resistance
pathway through analysis of the lipids by mass spectrometry and direct interactions with ArnA in kinetics and
binding experiments (Aim 2). The proposed work will validate the further development of the combination
therapy towards use in the clinic. Confirmation of the molecular target will also guide the optimization of even
more potent inhibitors in future work. Deciphering the molecular target could also allow us to extend the
therapy to other gram-negative bacteria like carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and drug-resistant
Salmonella as a long-term goal. The first-in-class inhibitor has the potential to widen the therapeutic index of
colistin, minimizing the drug’s serious side effects, as well as to enable the treatment of colistin-resistant
strains, ensuring the continued efficacy of the life-saving drug."

 Co-Leaders: Lisa Cadmus-Bertram and Nihal Ahmad
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Cancer Prevention & Control (CPC) Program spans basic, clinical, and population science to identify
effective approaches to reduce the burden of cancer for patients, their families, and communities through
improved prevention, early detection, and survival. In support of this overarching goal, the CPC program has
defined three thematic aims. Aim 1: Identify novel targets, biomarkers, agents, and strategies for cancer
prevention and risk reduction. Members continue to have national impact through tobacco cessation,
chemoprevention, and vaccine intervention science including drug development, clinical trial conduct, and
generating evidence to guide health policies. The UWCCC impacts national strategies for implementing
prevention research by directing the coordinating centers for the NCI-supported Cancer Center Cessation
Initiative and the Chemoprevention Consortium. Aim 2: Evaluate biopsychosocial factors and interventions
that influence the patient and family experience of cancer and supportive and palliative care needs.
Members conduct observational and interventional studies to characterize symptom experiences. Members also
develop and test pharmacologic, cognitive, and behavioral lifestyle intervention strategies to improve patient-
and family-centered outcomes across the survivorship continuum, from diagnosis through end of life. Aim 3:
Conduct health services research, emphasizing provider and system factors, with the goal of enhancing
the quality of cancer care. Members identify effective approaches for improving delivery of cancer screening
tests, diagnostic examinations, and cancer therapies. CPC members are using innovative simulation modeling,
bioinformatics, and multidisciplinary teams to improve the early detection and treatment of cancer, and to
leverage insights obtained through analysis of large databases to test approaches for improving access to
guideline-concordant clinical care. Across these three aims, CPC projects directly address the priorities of the
UWCCC catchment area including the elimination of cancer health disparities. The CPC Program has 40 CCSG
members in 17 departments and 6 schools/colleges. Since 2017, CPC members published 791 peer-reviewed
manuscripts (22% intra-programmatic, 22% inter-programmatic, 56% inter-institutional). PIs hold $14.2 million
(direct costs) in cancer-related grant funding with $6.5 million (direct costs) from NCI. The CPC Program supports
inter- and intra-programmatic interaction through pilot grants, seminars and retreats, experienced mentoring,
and collaborative working groups informed by evidence-based approaches from team science scholarship.
Guided by programmatic and center-wide strategic planning, priorities for the CPC program over the next 5 years
include addressing the challenges related to expanding survivorship studies, reducing cancer health disparities,
expanding precision prevention research, and expanding studies of colorectal and lung cancer early detection.
Thus, the overall objective of CPC is to reduce the burden of cancer for patients, their families, and communities
via improved prevention, early detection, treatment delivery, and survivorship support."
10749042,"Background. Deficits in emotion recognition are common in traumatic brain injury (TBI) and in post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) but these deficits have not been well studied in Veterans with both mild TBI (mTBI) and
PTSD. Poor emotion recognition has been associated with poor quality of interpersonal relationships, loss of
employment, behavioral problems, reduced social reintegration, social isolation and even suicide. Currently
there are no interventions for emotion recognition deficits in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD, and interventions
conducted in civilians with severe TBI have lacked training of both facial and vocal emotion recognition. In a
preliminary study of an innovative combination of facial and vocal modalities, a multimodal affect recognition
training (MMART) showed promise with significant improvement on the Florida Affect Battery (FAB) but lacked
attention training that is an essential component in recognizing rapidly changing emotions in our everyday
lives. Attention training using Brain HQ™ targets the required attention factors underlying emotion recognition.
Given the need to improve relationships and productivity in Veterans with mTBI and PTSD, a randomized
controlled trial is needed to determine the effectiveness of an innovative MMART combined with attention
training to improve emotion recognition and everyday function.
Objective & Hypotheses. The objective of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the treatment effect
of a MultiModal Affect Recognition Training (MMART) combined with attention training in Veterans with
TBI/PTSD.
Hypothesis 1. MMART combined with attention training will significantly improve performance on tests of
emotion recognition.
Hypothesis 2: Treatment gains will translate to functional activities.
Primary measures. Florida Affect Battery (FAB) and the Community Reintegration in Service members (CRIS).
Secondary measures. Emotion Recognition Task (ERT), attention index of the Repeatable Battery for the
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), the Continuous Performance Task and the TBI Quality of
Life (TBI-QOL) Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities.
Methods. 20 Veterans with mTBI and PTSD will be randomized to either the combined training or an inactive
control group. Both groups will attend 16, one-hour in-person sessions over 8 weeks. Outcomes will be
assessed at pre-, post-, 3 month-post-treatment. A linear regression will be used to determine significant
improvement of the treatment group over the control group, with t-tests to demonstrate within group
improvement. Effect size calculations will be used to determine the power needed for a future Merit proposal.
Significance. This study uses a novel combination of an innovative treatment, MMART+ Attention Training to
restore the emotion recognition and attentional processes required for effective emotion communication in
Veterans with mTBI/PTSD. This work meets a key VA RR&D priority of providing quality care to Veterans.
Positive study results will guide the development of a future Merit to improve the quality of life for Veterans with
emotion recognition deficits."
10814801,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Candidate: Lindsay Admon, MD, MSc is an obstetrician-gynecologist and junior health services researcher
focused on improving health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum women. Dr. Admon’s long-term career
objective is to become an independent investigator who is deeply committed to advancing maternal health
equity in the United States (US) through maternal health policy evaluation.
Research Context: Disruptions in insurance coverage during the perinatal period are frequent among the 4
million women giving birth in the US each year and particularly affect low-income, racial and ethnic minority,
and rural women as well as those with chronic conditions. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
insurance disruptions contribute to adverse maternal and child health (MCH) outcomes. The knowledge
generated by this proposal will inform clinical and policy strategies for addressing the maternal health crisis.
Candidate’s Background and Achievements: Dr. Admon is an Assistant Professor in Obstetrics &
Gynecology at the University of Michigan. She earned a Masters degree in Health and Healthcare Research
through the National Clinician Scholar’s Program. To date, she has published 24 original, peer-reviewed
research publications, including 15 on which she was the first or senior author. Based on her scientific body of
work, she was recently invited to lecture at the Eunice Kennedy Shiver National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development’s Workshop “Maternal Mortality in the United States: Future Research Directions.”
Career Development Plan: In order to achieve her goals, Dr. Admon will develop new expertise in
econometrics and survey methodology, working with Medicaid claims, and understanding Medicaid policy. Dr.
Admon’s career development goals will be supported by close mentorship from an interdisciplinary team,
advanced didactic coursework, and ongoing guidance in her research.
Specific Aims: 1) Measure the association between perinatal insurance disruptions and healthcare utilization
and health outcomes for mothers and their children (birth to 60 days postpartum); 2) Characterize association
between insurance disruptions and unmet healthcare needs (birth to six months postpartum); and 3) Among
low-income mother sin Michigan, examine the associations between new maternal eligibility for Medicaid
coverage (60 days to one year postpartum) under Medicaid expansion and maternal and infant enrollment in
Medicaid and healthcare utilization among infants during the first year after birth.
Deliverables: The proposed aims will contribute to the successful development of two R01 proposals: 1) To
further evaluate the role of insurance eligibility and benefit design in supporting the health of pregnant and
postpartum women; 2) To conduct a nationwide survey to explore more refine hypotheses on the associations
between insurance coverage, unmet healthcare needs, and MCH outcomes during the first year postpartum."

10844521,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goals of the DARE Collaboratory are to develop a viable combination regimen that reduces the rebound-
competent HIV/SIV reservoir during antiretroviral therapy (ART) and/or induces durable control of HIV/SIV in the
absence of therapy. Our proposed work is based on two observations made our group. First, we found that virus-
specific CD8+ T cells contribute to control of the virus at steady-state. These cells, however, have limited effect
during and immediately post-ART. We believe and will seek to prove that effective remission strategies will
require organization of a robust innate and adaptive immune response during the earliest stages of virus
rebound, effectively intercepting and suppressing viral rebound prior to the massive systemic growth of SIV/HIV
that overwhelms, damages and/or evades the immune system. Second, we and others have found that despite
virus expression during ART (either naturally or in response to a latency reversal agent), the frequency of infected
cells remains stable. We have found that infected cells are relatively resistant to cell death programs. We will
develop therapies that render these cells to host-mediated clearance mechanisms, thus resulting in their
reduction and perhaps elimination.
To achieve our goals, we will (1) characterize in people transcriptionally active cells and proliferating infected
cells, focusing on identifying mechanisms for persistence, (2) define in people the earliest immunologic and
virologic events post-interruption of ART, focusing on post-treatment controllers, (3) develop in non-human
primates (NHPs) a combination regimen that targets the reactivating virus during the immediate post-ART period
and results in sustained control at set-point and (4) develop in vitro and in animal models therapies that render
the reservoir more susceptible to death through the activation of intrinsic (cellular) and/or extrinsic (virus-specific)
pro-apoptotic pathways.
This work will leverage our deep investment in (1) the optimization of the SIV NHP model and a humanized
mouse model, both developed specifically to support the types of studies we will pursue, (2) the development of
a robust clinical cohort (SCOPE) designed to support intensive, biologic studies of people living with HIV (PWH),
and (3) the implementation and conduct of several clinical trials designed in part to test our hypotheses in people
and from which samples will be made available to our team for ex vivo studies.
We anticipate meeting the following milestones and deliverables: (1) definition of the active reservoir in lymphoid
tissues from SIV-infected monkeys and HIV-infected humans on effective ART, (2) determination of whether
reservoir cells are resistant to intrinsic and extrinsic cell killing, (3) development of a viable and translatable
remission strategy in NHPs, and (4) identification and pre-clinical development of interventions aimed at
enhancing the cell death, either by making cells more susceptible to cell death and/or by optimizing the efficacy
of the virus-specific T cell response."
10815731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A complex interplay of genetic variation underlies predisposition for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There is
now strong evidence from large consortia studies that mutations in genes involved in chromatin modification,
transcriptional regulation, and synaptic proteins confer substantial risk for ASD; however, the extent to which
these genes are interconnected and ultimately converge on a small number of functional deficits is largely
unknown. A critical need therefore exists to model new gene discoveries, to directly evaluate their functional
impact, and to determine their points of convergence. Innovations from our team and others in high-throughput
CRISPR-engineering have now made parallelized mechanistic studies tractable, and human induced pluripotent
stem cell (hiPSCs) derived neurons are well-suited to test the impact of ASD risk variants predicted to exert their
influence during fetal cortical development. Here, our multi-PI proposal will undertake an ambitious, systematic
isogenic loss-of-function (LoF) mechanistic screen in a compendium of 48 of the most robust ASD risk genes
discovered from the largest genetic studies to date. Moreover, our exciting preliminary results suggest that
transcriptional signatures shared across neuronal models of ASD genes converge on critical regulatory nodes
that result in synaptic deficits. Aim 1 will characterize isogenic glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons with highly
penetrant LoF mutations in 48 genes associated with ASD risk at genome-wide significant thresholds and that
are expressed in neurons. These analyses will identify transcriptional and functional signatures of individual ASD
genes through RNAseq and a series of high-throughput phenotyping assays in both neuronal sub-types. Aim 2
will expand our Preliminary Results to discover convergent genes downstream of ASD risk loci, characterize the
synaptic consequences of the ten most compelling discoveries from individual genes and/or convergent
signatures, and integrate these data to explore the druggability of the convergent networks. Our overarching
goal is to define any commonalities among diverse genes, pathways and networks that underlie ASD etiology,
and to dramatically expand the list of possible therapeutic targets for ASD. These studies will generate an
unprecedented isogenic resource of CRISPR-edited ASD genes, and matched RNAseq and cellular phenotyping
in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, that will be provided for open distribution to the broader community
through the NIMH RUDCR resource to yield new insights into neuropsychiatric disorders."
10864800,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As a result of mitigation policy and behavioral changes, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced access
to primary care, which is likely to have lasting effects on chronic disease management and health outcomes,
particularly for medically and socially vulnerable populations with existing chronic conditions. Newly available
longitudinal individual-level data allows us to rigorously examine these effects for the first time.
Although there is a large and growing literature quantifying disparities in outcomes related to COVID-19,
relatively less is known about how the pandemic has affected access to primary and preventive care as well as
associated health outcomes among medically and socially vulnerable populations. Understanding how the
pandemic affected the utilization of preventive health care and management of chronic conditions, such as
diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HTN), as well as the downstream outcomes, is critical to addressing
resultant health disparities and mitigating the impact of future disruptions to the healthcare system and
advancing interventions and policies to reduce health disparities
We will leverage this newly available and timely data to examine changes in receipt of healthcare during the
pandemic. Our data will include commercial health insurance claims in addition to a unique dataset containing
billing data for a large, urban safety-net county health system serving a low-income, largely minority patient
population. Within those populations, we will include a special focus examining individuals with DM or HTN.
Using a mixed-methods design, we will examine changes in health care utilization and the predictors of
disruptions over time. To more comprehensively understand contextual influences related to disruptions in
care, we will obtain complementary qualitative data through interviews with patients, providers and clinic staff,
and health systems leaders from the second largest municipal health system in the United States that will
explore the drivers of underutilization of primary and preventive care during and after the pandemic. Our
specific aims are to: (1) quantify the impact of the pandemic on racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of appropriate
primary care, chronic disease management, and downstream health outcomes; (2) compare the differential
effect of pandemic mitigation efforts between a commercially insured population and a safety net population;
and (3) contextualize the secondary health effects of the pandemic using qualitative interviews with health
systems stakeholders.
Using established and novel data sets, supplemented by qualitative interviews we will be able to shed light on
the changes in patterns of care management both during and after the pandemic for medically and socially
vulnerable patients. Such information is crucial to determining how we should direct health care resources
during national crises. However, these results are equally important in a post-pandemic landscape, in which
the way patients seek care and health systems offer care is permanently altered."

10835010,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Delivery of chromosomes, the basic units of inheritance, to each daughter cell during cell division is mediated by
the centromere. Our lab is interested in understanding how human centromeres are assembled, maintained and
propagated across the cell cycle. Mammalian centromeres are determined not by DNA sequence but rather
through epigenetic acquisition of a histone H3 variant called CENP-A. We have previously shown that most
CENP-A-containing chromatin consist of homotypic octameric nucleosomes and that DNA replication functions
not only to replicate DNA but also to correct errors in ectopic CENP-A deposition, leading to removal of ectopic
CENP-A and restricting CENP-A to centromeres only. In parallel, the same DNA replication machinery is capable
to precisely recycle CENP-A onto the daughter centromeres to re-assemble CENP-A onto the same centromeric
sequences. The combined actions of the DNA replication machinery of CENP-A removal from the chromosome
arms and CENP-A retention and recycling at the centromere results in the epigenetic maintenance of human
centromeres at a single locus on each chromosome. Our vision for the next five years is to harness the Telomere-
to-Telomere genome assembly, that contains the first description of fully assembled human centromeric genomic
maps and DNA methylation data, to build the CENCODE, an epigenomic landscape of human centromeres. The
CENCODE will be built using available and new ChIP-sequencing and Cut & Run datasets of CENP-A, CENP-
C and CENP-T/W/S/X nucleosome-like complex at each cell cycle point, as well as available DNA methylation
data, mapped to the centromeres within the Telomere-to-Telomere genome assembly to create a novel genomic
and epigenomic map for human centromeres. We will determine the relationship between CENP-A binding and
DNA methylation at neocentromeres and at ectopic sites of CENP-A deposition using long-read nanopore
sequencing, and the functional importance of centromeric DNA methylation. This project will lay the foundation
for future examination of centromeric epigenetic changes in aging and cancer. Next we will determine the
positional stability of human centromeres and whether CENP-A is capable to specify centromere position
precisely and stably across a single cell cycle and throughout cellular proliferation at base-pair resolution,
through the use of patient derived cell lines that harbor a neocentromere. The contribution of overexpressed
CENP-A and/or HJURP, both known to be elevated in several types of cancer, to human centromere drift and/or
expansion will be determined. We will explore error corrections mechanisms of ectopically loaded centromeric
proteins that aim to prevent failure of chromosome segregation as well as neocentromere formation. Finally,
innovative single molecule approaches will be used to define histone compositions and combinations of
epigenetic posttranslational modifications within single CENP-A-containing nucleosomes located across the
genome: at repetitive human centromeres, at non-centromeric ectopic sites, and at neocentromeres."
11116271,"Project Summary
This MIRA proposal aims to uncover the regulatory mechanisms and substrates for metalloproteases in the
ADAMTS (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin motifs) family. These proteases are thought
to be involved in many biological processes and some members are known to contribute to important human
diseases. The current study focuses mainly on two members of the ADAMTS family, ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS7.
Project 1 will investigate the allosteric regulation of ADAMTS13, an important regulator of blood clotting. I
recently discovered that ADAMTS13 adopts a quiescent closed conformation and becomes allosterically
activated by its substrate, Von Willebrand Factor (VWF). This proposal outlines a mechanistic approach to study
how allosteric regulation is maintained within ADAMTS13 and disrupted by its interaction with VWF. Leveraging
functional, kinetic, structural and bioinformatic analyses, this project sets to identify the key structural elements
of allosteric regulation in ADAMTS13. The outcomes from this work will improve our understanding of inherited
and acquired blood clotting disorders caused by defects in ADAMTS13. I also anticipate that our investigation of
ADAMTS13 will serve as a model to study the regulation of other ADAMTS proteases. Project 2 focuses on
ADAMTS7, which is known to contribute to coronary artery disease by promoting atherosclerosis and
inflammation. However, the substrate targets of ADAMTS7 and its biochemical properties remain poorly
understood. Previous attempts to address these research questions led to conflicting reports in the literature,
likely due to the poor quality of reagents and tools available to study this novel protease. To circumvent these
challenges, we will utilize novel methods in proteomics, enzymology, and protein-protein interactions to delineate
biochemical properties and ideal substrates for ADAMTS7. Newly identified substrates will form the basis of
novel biochemical tools to investigate ADAMTS7 activity and are necessary for future research goals to screen
for small molecule inhibitors of ADAMTS7 that may have translational applications. Summarily, the study of
ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS7 enzyme catalysis and regulation lay a foundation for our understanding of thrombotic
and bleeding disorders and cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, and these outcomes can be applied to
study other ADAMTS proteases. More importantly, the MIRA offers the principal investigator an incredible
opportunity to recruit and mentor students and other trainees from diverse backgrounds."
10893936,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a debilitating neurologic condition with complex genetic and environmental
inputs, characterized by excessive accumulation of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) and enlarged ventricles. Emerging
research suggests that disrupted neuroprogenitor cell (NPC) proliferation/differentiation, abnormal brain
angiogenesis and hypoxia may be involved in CH pathogenesis. Despite these recent advances there remain
critical gaps in our knowledge of disease etiology due to the lack of informative models. We developed a mouse
model for Proliferative Vasculopathy and Hydranencephaly Hydrocephalus (PVHH), a genetic form of CH caused
by mutation in the heme transporter, Flvcr2. Similar to humans, mice with genetic deletion of Flvcr2 in vascular
endothelial cells (ECs) develop abnormal brain blood vessels, tissue hypoxia, disrupted NPC differentiation, and
CH. In preliminary studies, we also found that neural cells produce and export large amounts of heme, that NPCs
strongly express the heme exporter, Flvcr1a, and that NPC-specific deletion of Flvcr1a causes a hydrocephalus
phenotype similar to Flvcr2 mutant mice. Together, this work links abnormal angiogenesis to disrupted
brain development and CH, and uncovers a central role for heme in these pathologies. In this proposal,
we investigate how heme, a molecule important for carrying oxygen in the body, is involved in the pathogenesis
of PVHH. We hypothesize that heme released from NPCs regulates brain angiogenesis and the NPC
micro-environment, and that disrupted heme transport causes reduced brain vascularization, tissue
hypoxia and downstream hydrocephalus. We will test this hypothesis in three distinct but interrelated aims:
In Aim 1, we will determine how heme is trafficked in the brain. Using innovative heme reporters and new
proteomics approaches, we will determine the primary cellular source of heme, mechanisms of heme
transport/trafficking, and the proteins interacting with heme in the brain. In Aim 2, we will focus on how heme
regulates brain angiogenesis in PVHH. Our preliminary data indicate that heme directly regulates Dll4-Notch
signaling, a pathway known to suppress angiogenic sprouting and reduce vascular growth. Using pharmacologic
treatments and gene perturbations, we will modulate heme and Dll4-Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo, and
determine whether Dll4-Notch is sufficient and necessary to produce the PVHH phenotype. In Aim 3, we will
determine the specific role of hypoxia and HIF-VEGF signaling in PVHH. In our PVHH models, we observe
severe hypoxia, strong upregulation of hypoxic signaling factor HIF2a in NPCs, and associated increase in the
HIF target gene, VEGF. Hypoxia and increased VEGF is found in humans with hydrocephalus, and targeting
VEGF in mouse models of CH reduces hydrocephalus. Here, we will block HIF-VEGF signaling using genetic
and pharmacologic approaches, then determine the impact on the PVHH phenotype. Together, these three aims
will explore a new role for heme in the development of PVHH, with the broader goal of understanding and
identifying new treatment targets for other forms of CH."

Endocrine therapies that inhibit estrogen receptor (ER) signaling are the mainstay of the systemic treatment of 
ER+ breast cancers. These therapies consist of approaches to reduce estrogen levels including luteinizing 
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in premenopausal women and aromatase inhibitors (AI) in 
postmenopausal women, and direct ER antagonists such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant. In the advanced disease 
setting, however, endocrine therapy-resistant cancers almost invariably emerge and are the major cause of 
breast cancer deaths. Multiple genetic and epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the 
emergence of endocrine therapy resistance. Several groups including our own have characterized mutations in 
the ER gene (ESR1) itself as a mechanism of resistance in approximately 20-30% of cases. We have developed 
cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of endocrine therapy-resistant ER+ breast cancer driven by 
these ESR1 mutations and have found that these mutations exhibit both ligand-independent functions that mimic 
estradiol-bound wild-type ER as well as allele-specific neomorphic properties that confer on ER novel signaling 
functions that promote a pro-metastatic EMT-like phenotype. In addition, using genome-wide CRISPR screens, 
we have identified genes essential for the growth of ER+ breast cancers. Importantly, we have also identified 
genes whose loss confers endocrine therapy resistance in the setting of the wild-type ER, including NF1, TSC1/2, 
PTEN and CSK. In these studies, we have found that loss of CSK leads to activation of SRC-family kinases 
(SFK), thereby promoting estrogen-independent growth and a pro-metastatic cancer cell phenotype. Notably, 
expression of CSK is regulated by estrogen through binding of ER directly to a transcriptional enhancer in the 
CSK gene. This reveals the existence of an estrogen-induced negative feedback loop that constrains the growth 
of ER+ tumors thereby limiting the efficacy of current therapies that target ER. The existence of this feedback 
loop suggests the provocative hypothesis that current endocrine therapies may themselves promote a pro- 
metastatic phenotype. Consistent with the overarching theme of this program to define new therapeutic 
vulnerabilities, we will study how genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity impact the development of resistance to 
endocrine therapy. Success of this project will allow the development integrative models of the 
mechanisms of endocrine therapy resistance that include the effect of tumor heterogeneity that can be 
used to predict effective new therapeutic targets and will allow the investigation of the link between 
endocrine therapy resistance, endocrine therapy and metastasis."

Myelofibrosis (MF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with an aggressive clinical course and a high risk for
early death. Current therapeutic approaches for patients with Philadelphia chromosome negative MPNs aim to
normalize blood counts, reduce splenomegaly and eliminate symptoms, but are incapable of halting disease
progression/evolution. MF originates at the level of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and the dysfunctional MF
bone marrow and splenic microenvironments promote the predominance of the malignant HSC. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that therapeutic approaches which selectively target and deplete the MF HSC pool
and restore the dysregulated MF microenvironment will be required to improve the treatment outcomes of MF
patients. Concepts developed by members of the MPN-RC (Projects 1-3) have led to novel therapeutic
approaches capable of depleting MF disease-initiating HSC. These strategies will be tested and validated in
investigator-initiated clinical trials with accompanying correlative biomarkers to document therapeutic responses.
These correlates are designed to assess the degree of MF HSC depletion as well as mechanisms underlying
treatment responses and resistance. The trials will be pursued using the established infrastructure of the MPN
Clinical Consortium, an effective independent clinical trials group focused on improving the outcomes of MF
patients. To achieve these goals, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Assess whether mechanism-
based strategies such as combination of an HDM2 antagonist and a BET inhibitor, are tolerable and clinically
active in early phase MF clinical trials (MPN-RC 124). (2) Evaluate the safety and clinical activity of a novel type
II JAK2 inhibitor in MF patients in an early phase clinical trial (MPN-RC 126). (3) Utilize biomarker studies from
patients enrolled in MPN-RC clinical trials to determine target pathway engagement and association with clinical
responses or lack of responses and mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in order to better inform future
therapeutic development. (4) Annually obtain peripheral blood and/or bone marrow cells from MF patients (MPN-
RC 106) which will be stored in Core B in order to provide mutational characterized specimens that will be utilized
for the investigations planned in Projects 1-3."
10846812,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Rural Americans face disproportionate cardiovascular disease burden, yet they must travel farther to reach
hospitals that can provide effective, guideline-concordant treatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
Transfer networks play a crucial role in care for rural ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI), the most
severe form of AMI, moving patients from rural hospitals to hospitals that can perform primary Percutaneous
Coronary Intervention (PCI), the preferred treatment for STEMI. Of the 925 hospitals have closed or been
acquired in rural areas since 2007, 75% may have been part of a STEMI transfer network. Although closures
and acquisitions of hospitals may disrupt STEMI transfer network, the impact on STEMI patients has not been
explored. Existing research on hospital closures finds conflicting results on AMI mortality. Failure to account for
networks disadvantages previous research in 3 ways. 1) Time to PCI depends on the geographic location and
the transfer relationships of hospitals within STEMI transfer networks. 2) Disruptions can cause spillover
effects to patients not directly affected by closures and acquisitions but in the same transfer network. 3) The
characteristics of network affect time to PCI after disruption. Although not previously explored, disruptions in
rural STEMI networks could worsen rural-urban disparities in AMI mortality rates and reverse reductions in
rural cardiovascular mortality over the past four decades. This project will draw upon novel data resources
collected by the research team including validated data on hospital closure status and timing and validated
data on hospital-level PCI capabilities. Leveraging the expertise of the research team in innovative network
analysis techniques, invasive cardiology, emergency medicine, rural health, Medicare claims data, and
biostatistics we will estimate STEMI transfer networks using Medicare claims data from 2007-2021 and link
networks to hospital closure and acquisition data collected and validated by the research team. We will
leverage connections to stakeholders in STEMI systems of care and rural health as well as expertise in survey
design and implementation to develop a survey of EMS agencies to collect information on the emergency
medical services involvement in STEMI networks. We propose the following aims: 1) estimate the association
of STEMI network disruption with through0network time to PCI; 2) estimate the association of STEMI network
disruption with STEMI treatment and mortality; 3) identify network-level factors associated with changes in
patient mortality after STEMI network disruption; and 4) quantify the role of STEMI transfer network disruption
in rural-urban STEMI disparities. We will disseminate information on STEMI networks and their characteristics
via a web-based app. Our findings will identify a previously unknown access barrier for rural patients and can
inform policymakers and clinicians about how to improve the health of rural STEMI patients."

10804696,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as a major healthcare concern due, in part, to the organism’s propensity
to develop resistance to front-line antibiotics. The A. baumannii resistome includes aminoglycoside and β-lactam
modifying factors, but is primarily comprised of at least 40 drug efflux systems belonging to 6 distinct pump
families. Intrinsic multidrug resistance occurs via mutations that lead to overexpression of one or more efflux
systems, thereby allowing the organism to extrude antibiotics from the cell. Recently we discovered efflux
systems also modulate adaptive A. baumannii antibiotic resistance. Meaning, transfer of antibiotic susceptible
strains to physiologically relevant growth conditions, such as human serum, leads to the upregulation of at least
18 annotated efflux pump components, which in turn allows for efflux mediated resistance to antibiotic levels that
are achievable within a patient. This phenomenon, which has been termed adaptive efflux mediated resistance
(AEMR) by Handcock and colleagues, has been hypothesized to be one means by which otherwise antibiotic
susceptible strains fail to respond to antibiotic treatment within the clinic. We hypothesized that the hyper-efflux
phenotype of AEMR conditions would provide a unique and innovative screening platform to identify broad-
spectrum efflux pump inhibitors that inhibit multiple A. baumannii efflux pumps. Indeed, a pilot high throughput
screen led to the identification of the benzenesulfonamide class of efflux pump inhibitors that eliminate AEMR
and antibiotic resistance within strains that overexpress efflux pumps that are notorious causes of multidrug
resistance among clinical isolates. Our goals herein are to 1. Expand our screening approach to include a larger,
chemically diverse compound library to arrive at additional chemical series of A. baumannii efflux pump inhibitors
(EPIs), 2. Use medicinal chemistry to optimize the benzenesulfonamide and as many as two additional chemical
series of EPIs, 3. Define the cellular target of the benzenesulfonamides and new chemical classes of EPIs, and
4. Test the in vivo efficacy of front runner compounds against A. baumannii strains that exhibit efflux mediated
multidrug resistance."

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and worldwide, with a worsening trajectory due
to increasingly aging populations. Precise understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying normal
cardiac physiology, and how they are compromised in disease, is critical for identifying new drug targets and
developing effective new therapeutics to combat heart disease. Ca2+ cycling involving local signaling between
surface L-type Ca2+ (CaV1.2) channels and intracellular ryanodine receptors (RYR2) is responsible for the Ca2+-
induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that underlies cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Dysregulation of both CaV1.2
and RYR2 contributes to abnormal calcium signaling that is an adverse hallmark of cardiac disease. β-adrenergic
augmentation of cardiac contractility is crucial for the fight-or-flight response and is mediated by increased CaV1.2
current and sensitization of RYR2; yet, excessive activation of this pathway under chronic stress results in post-
translational modifications of RYR2 channels that cause them to become ‘leaky’ and cause cardiac pathology,
and also a potential harmful subcellular redistribution of CaV1.2. There are significant gaps in knowledge
regarding CaV1.2 and RYR2 functional organization and regulation in heart under both and disease conditions;
how their dysregulation or dysfunction contributes to heart disease progression; and whether and how they can
be targeted for effective treatment of heart failure (HF) and other cardiac diseases. This Program Project Grant
(PPG) comprises four Projects and two Scientific Cores that have been put together to help address these critical
gaps. The overarching goal is to define the mechanisms that regulate local Ca2+ signaling by CaV1.2 and RYR2
in normal and failing hearts with unprecedented precision. While each project stands on its own footing as far as
being comprised of innovative and exciting research, all are dependent on the expertise provided by the Cores
and are enriched by interproject collaborations that are greatly enhanced by the PPG structure. All four Projects
leverage the Pakistan Genome Resource (PGR) (Core A), a unique cohort of individuals with extensive

EBV(+) epithelial cancers represent 75% of all the EBV(+) malignancies. Despite the presence of virus infection,
these EBV(+) tumors receive the same treatment as EBV(-) cancers. The long-term goal of this Program Project
is to identify specific targetable mechanisms of EBV-mediated oncogenesis in epithelial cells. We previously
showed that EBV latency and oncogenicity are regulated by factors that link epigenetics with metabolism, such
Poly-ADP-ribose Polymerases (PARPs). Drugs that target PARPs have the potential to be effective therapeutic
options for EBV(+) tumors. However, our incomplete understanding of the epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms
regulating EBV latency in epithelial cells limits the application of such drug options to treat EBV(+) epithelial
malignancies.
In this project (Project 2), we investigated the role of PARP1 in regulating EBV genome maintenance, gene
expression, and metabolic sensing in epithelial cells. We found that PARP1 forms a complex with CTCF on the
EBV genome. We now show that this complex includes UHRF1, an epigenetic reader protein involved in DNA
methylation pattern propagation. We found that treatment of EBV(+) cells with PARP1 inhibitors disrupts this
complex altering both viral and cellular gene expression and causing global DNA hypomethylation. Consistently,
PARP inhibitors synergized with DNA hypomethylating agents to elicit cytotoxicity in EBV+ gastric cancers both
in vitro and in vivo. Based on these data, we hypothesize that in EBV+ epithelial cells, PARP1, by interacting
with CTCF and UHRF1 and modulating their functions, is a key epigenetic factor that connects 3D chromatin
conformation and DNA methylation to enable EBV latency and EBV-driven epithelial cell oncogenesis .We base
our hypothesis on our preliminary data showing that EBV+ epithelial cells hyper-activate PARP1 and that this
drives changes in the 3D conformation of the EBV genome supporting viral latent gene expression. We observed
that multiple mechanisms for hyper-activation of PARP1 exist in EBV+ cells, including regulation of the ERK/MEK
pathway. We observed that differences exist in NAD+/NADH ration between EBV+ and EBV- epithelial cells,
indicating that EBV+ cells are metabolically equipped to sustain PARP1 activation. This observation is consistent
with our observation that EBV+ cells are sensitive to inhibitors of NAD salvage pathways, indicating that NAD
metabolism plays a key and underappreciated role in EBV -driven oncogenesis in epithelial cancer cells.
Programmatic Interactions. This project is highly integrated with other projects and cores. Collaborations with
Project 1 on the effect of PARP1 and NAD metabolism on EBNA1 functions; and with Project 3 on the relevance
of the PARP1/CTCF/UHRF1 complex for CIMP reversal and PI3K blockade. We have engaged all three cores:
Core B for the development of novel small molecule PARP1 degraders, Core D for analysis of chromosome
conformations and gene regulation, and Core A and C for analysis of EBV epithelial tumor response in mouse
and organoids, and production of site-directed mutations in EBV."
10840318,"PROJECT 3 – PROJECT SUMMARY
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with multiple epithelial cell diseases, including gastric cancer and
nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Despite its B-cell tropism, more than half of the 200,000 EBV-associated cancers
that occur annually are gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinomas. The Cancer Genome Atlas project identified
EBV-infected gastric cancer as one of the four biologically distinct subtypes. Extreme tumor genome CpG island
methylator phenotype (CIMP) and gain-of-function PI3K mutations are salient features, suggesting
interconnected driver roles in EBV+ GC. In fact, EBV+ gastric cancer has the highest level of DNA methylation
of any human cancer. Hypermethylation and elevated PI3K activity are also characteristic of EBV+ NPC and
Burkitt lymphoma, further suggesting a close pathogenetic relationship of these oncogenic properties with highly
restricted forms of EBV latency. Yet, much remains to be learned about how latent EBV mutation together with
tumor driver mutations result in epithelial cancers, and how these can be targeted by precision approaches. We
therefore used EBV+ epithelial tumor cell RNAseq and CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify host factors whose
knockout is synthetic lethal with reversal of CIMP by the hypomethylating agent decitabine or upon blockade of
PI3K hyperactivity by the highly selective antagonist alpelisib. Our central hypothesis is that EBV+ epithelial
cancers rely on cross-talk between latent viral genomes, and hyperactive PI3K and CIMP, disruption of
which can be targeted in synthetic lethal approaches. Our Aims are to (1) Define the role of latent EBV in
driving CIMP; (2) Define the role of hyperactive PI3K signaling in EBV+ epithelial cancers in support of CIMP;
(3) Define key synthetic lethal vulnerabilities upon EBV+ epithelial cancer CIMP reversal. Collectively, these
studies are expected to identify how EBV-infected epithelial cancers subvert host methionine and PI3K
metabolism pathways to support CIMP, and how in turn CIMP not only silences tumor suppressors, but also
plays key roles in guarding against DNA damage. Our studies may therefore support strategies to develop
rational therapeutic approaches for EBV-associated epithelial cancers."

The Chemical Probes and Drug Discovery (Core B) will provide state-of-the-art assay development, screening,
and synthetic/medicinal chemistry expertise to support all three Projects. In Project 1, Core B will develop new
EBNA1 Probes and DNA-Tacs targeting EBNA1 degradation. Degraders of EBNA1 are predicted to be more
efficacious. Novel approaches for degraders will leverage shRNA PLOD1 silencing showing EBNA1 degradation
and the use of novel EBNA1 targeted PLOD1 inhibition. We will use small DNA oligos as targeting ligands
conjugated to E3 ligase recruiting molecules as chemical tool compounds for degradation of EBNA1. In Project
2, we will develop selective PARP1 degraders and compare these to known PARP inhibitors to compare the
effect of degradation of PARP1 protein compared to inhibition of PARP1 enzymatic activity. We have shown that
PARP inhibitors and importantly PARP PROTACs synergize with ATR inhibition, ATM inhibition, and decitabine.
The observation that PARP1 selective PROTACs kill SNU719 cells equally or with greater potency as Olaparib
suggests trapping may not be required for bioactivity. We have developed prototype PARP1 inhibitors using the
clinically relevant PARP inhibitor Olaparib conjugated to E3 ligase recruiting ligands to recruit cereblon (CRBN)
or Mdm2. We found that our prototype compounds selectively degrade PARP1 and have observed that
degraders utilizing the Mdm2 recruiting ligand are effective in killing SNU719 EBV gastric cancer cells. We utilize
an innovative plate based In-Cell Western assay to optimize the activity of the PROTACs to increase the assay
through-put and accuracy, and to prioritize compounds for Western blot confirmation. In Project 3, we will
develop novel inhibitors and degraders for UHRF1, an important protein that plays a key role in maintaining DNA
methylation in mammalian cells. Core B has developed an HTRF assay for measuring UHRF1 binding to specific
trimethyl-lysine ligand to further enable the development of UHRF1 degraders and inhibitors that block its
mechanism in CIMP. Preliminary screening results have identified potent sub-micromolar UHRF1 ligands,
including bi-functional molecules being evaluated as novel UHRF1 degraders.
 Core B will also provide assay development and screening for all the Projects. For example, synergy
screening in the EBV positive SNU719 gastric cancer cell line typically using the NCI library of known pan-cancer
drugs and epigenetic library of known clinical drugs. The specific aims for Core B are (1) to provide state-of-the-
art Synthetic chemistry/ Medicinal chemistry capabilities to design and synthesize chemical probes for all the
projects, and (2) to develop suitable biochemical and cell-based assays to support probe optimization efforts and
to provide synergy screens to enhance the activity of our current probes."

Despite high vaccination coverage, pertussis outbreaks caused by the gram-negative obligate human pathogen
Bordetella pertussis (Bp) are observed in many countries. Pertussis resurgence correlates with the switch in the
1990s from whole cell vaccines (wPV) which elicit long-lived Th1/17 immune responses, to acellular vaccines
(aPV) which elicit Th1/2 skewed immune responses. Furthermore, aPV do not prevent nasal colonization or
transmission of Bp. Current aPV are comprised of 1-5 bacterial proteins that were selected for their roles in
pathogenesis and ability to elicit antibodies. In contrast, wPV present an undefined large number of antigens.
The combination of limited antigenic diversity and Th2 skewed immune profile is a likely explanation for the
incomplete protection provided by aPV. Recent studies including that from our laboratory also show that
circulating Bp strains (CBp) from globally diverse countries have absent/reduced expression of current aPV
antigens, suggesting that aPV may be significantly less effective against CBp strains. There is increasing
recognition that CD4+ T cell responses are critical for long-lived protective immune responses that clear the
entire respiratory tract. However, it is not clear that current aPV antigens are optimal CD4+ T cell targets. We
will use state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, and phenotypic and functional assays to identify
proteins expressed by CBp that are processed and presented on Class II histocompatibility antigens of humans
and mice, and that stimulate CD4+ T cell responses. This foundational data set will be coupled with a prime-pull
vaccination strategy and a Th1/17 skewing adjuvant developed in our laboratory, to determine the
immunogenicity and protective efficacy of newly defined antigens to create a next-gen aPV.
 Specific Aim 1: Define the set of naturally derived Bp peptides presented on MHC II and
recognized by CD4+ T cells. We will identify the Bp antigens from circulating Bp strains (CBp) that are
expressed on human and murine Class II, and use proliferation and flow cytometry assays to determine which
antigens are recognized by CD4+ T cells of wPV-immunized individuals and convalescent mice.
 Specific Aim 2: To test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of novel antigens against
circulating Bp strains and their role in pathogenesis. We will test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy
of the novel proteins using a murine model of Bp infection. We will create deletion mutants of the novel proteins
in CBp to determine their role in pathogenesis and colonization of the respiratory tract.
IMPACT: Our integrated approach to identify, test, and leverage novel Bp antigens will permit the rational design
of next-gen aPVs that elicit long-lasting protection in the respiratory tract, prevent nasopharyngeal carriage and
thereby reduce the spread of the disease pertussis."

 The Integrative Liver Cell Core (ILCC) strives to serve the scientific community of alcoholic liver
disease (ALD) and cirrhosis via specialized services of isolating 6 different liver cell types
(hepatocytes, HC; hepatic macrophages, HM; hepatic stellate cells, HSC; sinusoidal endothelial
cells, SEC; mesothelial cells, MC; and CD133+ ductular reaction progenitors, DRP) from 12 different
ALD and liver fibrosis models which reproduce wide and specific spectra of liver diseases.
 To support leading-edge cell type specific research, the ILCC also couples these isolation
procedures with innovative techniques: 1) Rosa26-reporter mouse-based genetic lineage and cell fate
tracing for HC, DRP, HSC, and HM in ALD and alcohol-promoter liver tumor; 2) fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS)-based analysis of resident vs. migrating HM to assess their relative
contributions to alcoholic steatohepatitis; 3) FACS-based isolation of vitamin A+/Col1a1- quiescent
HSC, vitamin A+/Col1a1+ activated HSC, and vitamin A-/Col1a1+ mesenchymal cells from mouse
ALD models; and 5) FACS isolation of CD133+ tumor-initiating stem cell-like cells and DRP from
alcohol-promoted liver tumor and alcoholic hepatitis. To achieve these integrative services, the ILCC
closely collaborates with the Animal Core of the P50 Alcohol Center and supports genetic loss or gain
of function approaches at each specific cellular level in mouse models of chronic alcoholic
steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic liver fibrosis, and alcohol-promoted liver tumor.
 Since the last renewal submission, the ILCC served 41 investigators from 25 institutions by
performing 1,151 isolation preparations and providing 283 Cell Bank samples. These efforts
facilitated 34 publications and acquisition or continuation of 20 federal grants plus 2 pending
applications. Of these 41 investigators, 22 were out-of-region investigators and 14 were early career
investigators across the country, attesting that the ILCC contributes as a national resource.
 The proposed ILCC renewal aims to continue its unique and cutting-edge services of liver cell
isolation and analysis and to promote genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and molecular research on
altered cell fate regulation of different liver cell types which manifest as fundamental mechanisms
underlying inflammation, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis in ALD."

The Enrichment Program conducts activities that support the mission of the Pennington/Louisiana NORC and
are designed “to facilitate and promote collaborative and multidisciplinary interactions that will foster new
research ideas and enhance the translation of basic nutritional research findings into the clinical-research arena
and ultimately into clinical application”. It provides opportunities to foster multidisciplinary approaches to
nutrition/obesity research and to attract new investigators or investigators with relevant expertise to the field. The
program accomplishes this by 1) improving communication among NORC members, 2) monitoring the
participation of investigators in enrichment activities associated with the NORC grant, 3) promoting awareness
of the NORC and disseminating information about its research findings to other scientists, health care
professionals and the community, and 4) coordinating events that attract distinguished nutritional scientists to
Pennington Biomedical and Louisiana. To maximize resources for training and enrichment, our program
dovetails with other NIH-sponsored research and training groups in Louisiana (The Louisiana Clinical and
Translational Science Center, Pennington Biomedical’s Center of Biomedical Research Excellence and two T32
Postdoctoral Training Grants). The program is directed by Dr. Leanne Redman who is the Associate Executive
Director for Scientific Education at Pennington Biomedical and Co-Program Director of the Training in Obesity
Research T32. The enrichment program strives to specifically cater to 5 unique groups including NORC
members, the participating institutions’ faculty, postdocs and students, and the lay community. Efforts will be
made to reach out across the state and to provide enrichment opportunities for current and future nutrition/obesity
researchers at multiple career levels including NORC member scientists, faculty from Louisiana universities and
medical schools, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students, and medical students. A variety of
evaluated activities will be used to deliver enrichment opportunities. Our new annual initiatives include a traveling
Louisiana/Pennington NORC roadshow “Obesity Day”, sponsoring seminars and visiting scientists, providing
webinars and on-site training courses, teaching graduate courses in molecular and clinical nutrition and providing
undergraduate student internships, a NIH-funded postdoctoral training program in obesity research
(T32DK064584-16; recently renewed through May 2024)."
10833525,"Abstract
Seventy percent of American adults are overweight or obese, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the
nation’s health systems. Effective behavioral programs exist, but these programs are intensive, long-term and
require highly-trained clinicians, making them prohibitively expensive and thus limiting disseminability.
Approaches to decreasing costs include replacing highly-trained clinicians with paraprofessionals, reducing
contact frequency, and/or automating intervention. However, although these alternative interventions result in
considerably lower average weight losses, variability of weight loss is high. Specifically, and consistent with a
Supportive Accountability Model, a substantial minority of participants in high-intensity interventions receive no
benefit, while a subset of those receiving low-intensity interventions achieve clinically significant weight loss.
An ideal weight loss treatment system would enhance outcomes and reduce costs by matching each
participant to the intervention he/she needs, thus adapting to participants’ needs and conserving resources
where they are not needed. Stepped care represents one such system, but has had mixed success and suffers
from a number of shortcomings. The innovative artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of reinforcement learning
(RL) provides rapidly and repeatedly-varying features of intervention, continuously ""learning"" which features
provide optimal responses for which participants. Our team recently completed a pilot of an AI weight loss
system in which overweight adults received a brief in-person weight loss intervention and then were randomly
assigned to receive 3 months of non-optimized interventions (i.e., 12-minute phone calls) or an optimized
combination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages, selected based on each participants’
response to each intervention as determined by weight and behavioral data. As hypothesized, we achieved
equivalent weight losses at a fraction of the time cost. The proposed study would recruit 320 overweight adults,
provide 1 month of group-based behavioral weight loss treatment and then randomize participants to either
continue to receive group-based behavioral weight loss in a remote format for 11 months (BWL-S) or to
reinforcement learning-based treatment (BWL-AI). In line with our Supportive Accountability model, BWL-AI
would vary modality, intensity and counselor skill based on continuously-monitored participant digital data. The
proposed study--the first of its kind--would expand on our pilot in several ways including sample size, duration,
and features of intervention selected by the AI system. Aims of this project are to test the hypotheses that
weight loss outcomes in BWL-AI will be equivalent to or better than BWL-S, and that the cost per participant
and per kg of lost weight will be less in BWL-AI than in BWL-S. Other include characterizing the AI system (in
terms of interventions selected), assessing feasibility and acceptability of the refined AI system, evaluating
psychological and demographic predictors of AI intervention selection and investigating differences between
responders and non-responders in how the AI system allocates resources."

Dr Sharmila Dorbala is an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a physician/scientist
at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). She has devoted her career to patient-oriented research focusing on
cardiac amyloidosis. She contributed independently to the field of cardiac amyloidosis through a succession of
substantive studies utilizing molecular imaging to phenotype cardiac amyloidosis in order to diagnose and
manage this condition. Her research program is impactful, both directly and through effective mentoring of the
next generation of amyloidosis investigators. Dr. Dorbala has successfully mentored 26 pre- and post-doctoral
trainees in patient- oriented research projects. She is currently PI of two active NIH R01 grants and also has
funding from AHA and foundation/industrial sources. Her program provides a unique opportunity for POR due
to the intersection of resources from programs in clinical investigation at the Harvard School of Public Health
and the BWH cardiovascular imaging T32 program. Her mentees have presented their work nationally and
internationally, published papers, and won research awards and pilot grants.
The new research aims proposed in this award lay the foundation for adjunct interventions to enhance
transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) therapies and novel image-based personalized strategies to predict
treatment failure. She will assess (1) sonoporation, a therapeutic ultrasound technique to increase myocardial
perfusion and, consequently, improve delivery of antifibril drugs; (2) shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the
gut microbiome to inform development of nutrition-based adjunct therapies; (3) radiomics of 99mTc-
pyrophosphate SPECT/CT to assess treatment response, and (4) machine learning based CT-derived sarcopenia
metric to predict survival. This research has important clinical implications. Currently approved TTR
stabilizing/silencing drugs, though lifesaving for most, are not effective in about 30% of patients. Moreover,
while these therapies improve clinical outcomes, they do not treat amyloid fibril. Fibril-targeted therapies have
been unsuccessful to date, probably because of poor interstitial drug delivery due to the presence of fibril. The
results of the proposed mentoring and research activities of this K24 project are likely to not only substantially
improve outcomes and alleviate HF symptoms in these gravely ill patients, but also transform her patient-
oriented research program into a formal individualized program of mentoring with a focus on preventing heart
failure from amyloidosis."

The future biomedical workforce requires investigators who can conduct and drive innovation in future clinical
translational research (CTR) and science (CTS), are skilled in discussing research with those outside their own
field, and thus have the ability to critically examine research in both related and unrelated fields. Our
established Tufts K12 Program has demonstrated success in training early career faculty who, after training,
remain engaged in translational research and science aimed at improving health. We will build upon our
training successes through the following specific goals:
1. Train investigators who can serve as domain experts and rigorous researchers, thereby advancing the
 understanding and rigorous implementation of translational science and research methods, spanning the
 sectors of translational science across all Tufts CTSI partners
2. Train K12 Scholars in translational science to prepare them to serve as system thinkers, boundary-
 crossers, and team players
3. Provide K12 Scholars with leadership and management skills needed for sustained translational science
 careers, and to serve as process innovators, and skilled communicators
4. Mentor newly independent faculty to develop the next generation of mentors to future translational
scientists
5. Build a diverse translational science workforce
We will achieve these goals by a focused, integrated and collaborative program career development plan that
supports skill development in translational science to ensure that Scholars gain proficiency in discourse and
discovery across disciplines while they also develop deep expertise within their own domain. The career
development plan includes a combination of independent research project, didactic seminars and courses, and
mentoring. The core of the plan is a mentoring team that incorporates team science and inclusive excellence to
support self-directed learning under the support of a team of individuals with complementary skills in
translational science, leadership and management, and stakeholder engagement and communication.
We aim to appoint eight scholars. All candidates will have a full-time appointment at one of our partnering
institutions. Initial appointments for all candidates will be for two years, with opportunity for an additional third
year. The outcome of our training will be a diverse group of independently funded translational investigators
across multiple disciplines within Tufts CTSI and who are highly skilled in multi-disciplinary team approaches.
These investigators will have the skills required to advance interdisciplinary translational science that will
address the complex challenges to improving health."

The Rural Alaska Community Action Program (RurAL CAP), which administers Head Start schools in rural
Alaska, reports that 68% of Alaska Native children ages 3 to 5 years are overweight and 43% are obese.
Diet, physical activity, and sleep hygiene are primary risk factors for childhood obesity, a risk factor for
cardiometabolic diseases later in life. Notably, subclinical cardiovascular pathology can be detected as early as
3 years of age. Once living off the land and sea, Alaska Native (AN) people have suffered decades of colonization
and in-migration, which have interfered with traditional food consumption, signaling a striking change in local
food systems. Diet and physical activity are prime targets for early intervention, as taste preferences and exercise
habits established in childhood forge lifelong adherence. Thus, we have designed More Outside Your Door
(MOYD), a multilevel intervention, which at the individual level builds on our prior efforts to promote traditional
diet and activities to decrease risk for obesity in AN preschoolers. At the family level, MOYD provides feedback
to parents about their child’s health screenings; at the school level, it features traditional foods, outdoor
traditional physical activities, and a culturally centered curriculum. At the community level, it offers resources
to improve the built environment for safe outdoor play that invites all community members to participate. In
partnership, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, RurAL CAP, and collaborators will refine and test the
effectiveness of MOYD at 12 Head Start preschools in the Yukon-Kuskokwim region: (1) we will use qualitative
methods with Head Start staff, parents, and community Elders to optimally tailor MOYD for southwest Alaska
communities; and (2) we will conduct a stepped-wedge group-randomized trial to test its effect on children’s
diet, physical activity (PA), body mass index (BMI), and other risk factors for obesity-related chronic disease over
three years. Primary outcomes are diet (classroom meals, actigraphy-based physical activity, and body mass
index. Secondary outcomes include individual child level measures of hemoglobin levels and educational and
developmental progress; parent report of diet, activity, and sleep at home; and measures of traditional
foods/sugar-sweetened/processed foods by carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios using fingernail clippings.
We will also measure outcomes at the school level (classroom meals, outdoor time) and community level
(objective data on use of play space). (3) We will conduct a process evaluation using the RE-AIM framework.
Our Specific Aims are to (1) conduct preschool staff and parent/elder workgroups to refine the MOYD
intervention for optimal effectiveness for obesity prevention among AN preschool children; (2) test the
effectiveness of MOYD on a) diet, PA, outdoor time, and BMI; and b) improving other clinical and behavioral risk
factors for obesity-related chronic disease in preschool children; and (3) implement the RE-AIM framework to
evaluate dissemination and implementation of the MOYD intervention in Head Start programs."
10844588,"SUMMARY
Exposing cells to excessive amounts of lipid and other nutrients promotes the accumulation of sphingolipids such
as ceramides, which alter tissue metabolism to help cells adapt to the abundance of excessive, detergent-like
fatty acids (Chaurasia et al., Science, 2019). Studies described herein reveal that ceramides play particularly
prominent roles in the gastrointestinal tract, where they increase fatty acid uptake into intestinal stem cells to
promote regeneration of the intestinal epithelium. Using organoid, fly, and mouse models, we will dissect the
mechanisms linking these sphingolipids to the control of intestinal stem cell metabolism, proliferation, and
differentiation. Moreover, we will explore the contribution of sphingolipids as signals of lipid excess that drive
gastrointestinal tumorigenesis and invasiveness. Findings obtained from these studies could uncover new
nutrient-sensing machinery that modulates intestinal stem cell proliferation and leads to new pharmacological
approaches for manipulating sphingolipids to improve gut health."
10843208,"Project Summary: This proposal addresses a significant public health problem – childhood obesity and
related health disparities faced by Hispanic children from low-income families – for which interventions are
lacking. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) will test the effectiveness of a family-inclusive weight
management program developed for low-income Hispanic populations. Interventions to prevent and treat
childhood obesity have historically excluded Spanish speaking families.
 The intervention to be tested has been designed through in-depth collaborative research involving
childhood-obesity clinician/researchers, safety-net clinics, community organizations, and the low-income and
mostly Hispanic families they serve. The Healthy Living Program / La Vida Saludable (HeLP) has been
designed to achieve reach, retention, and effectiveness for low-income and Hispanic families, including
Spanish Speakers. HeLP incorporates the core components of evidence-based family-based-behavioral-
therapy at a dose the US Preventive Services Task Force has recommended to be effective. The key novel
design components of HeLP include: 1) Inclusion of the entire family. Previous interventions have focused on
parent-child dyads. In HeLP, children with obesity and all siblings 2-16 years and adult caregivers receive
targeted curricular components. Younger healthy weight siblings of children referred for obesity are targeted for
obesity prevention, 2) Hands-on family training in meal-planning, shopping, and cooking is focused on reducing
food insecurity while adapting traditional cuisine, 3) Delivery close to home through a partnership of primary
care clinics and recreation centers, and 4) Delivery by trained, low-cost, culturally and linguistically concordant
health educators.
 The goal of this research is to definitively assess using a randomized controlled design the effectiveness of
the HeLP intervention for treatment and prevention of overweight and obesity vs a primary care counseling
protocol active control condition—Recommended Treatment of Obesity in Primary Care (RTOP). The aims of
this study are to: 1) compare the effectiveness of HeLP vs. RTOP at BMI reduction in three age groups of low-
income Hispanic children with obesity: 2-6, 7-12, and 13-16 years (secondary measures include:
cardiometabolic lab tests, fitness, quality of life, eating behaviors, and food security); 2) To compare the
effectiveness of HeLP at obesity prevention by comparing the BMI trajectory of non-obese 2-11yr old children
with BMI above median whose siblings are enrolled in HeLP vs. RTOP; 3) To study implementation of HeLP
and RTOP within the RE-AIM framework, including: Reach, Adoption, Implementation (fidelity, replication
costs, and cost per unit BMI change), and Maintenance. This proposal seeks to fill a major gap in
understanding of how childhood obesity might be effectively treated in low-income and Hispanic families."
10883558,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall
While mortality rates for many cancers are declining, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) remains a highly
lethal malignancy with the worst 5-year survival rate of the common malignancies. Unfortunately, current
therapies are largely ineffective in PDA, an outcome attributed in large part to therapeutic resistance. The highly
fibrotic and poorly vascularized tumor microenvironment (TME) restricts both nutrient availability and drug
delivery, and provides pro-survival and immunosuppressive cues. These limitations create energy stresses that
drive metabolic adaptations to support tumor growth and therapeutic resistance. Moreover, the hyperactivation
of pro-survival and resistance pathways in tumor and stromal cell types results in an integrated resistance
network. The induction of these pathways is orchestrated by cell-to-cell communications within the TME,
including aberrant glycosylation (CA-19-9) and the secretion of immunosuppressive and pro-survival paracrine
factors, such as Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). In addition, cells
adapt to the hypoxic, nutrient-depleted TME by upregulating cell type-specific survival programs, including
autophagy. Ultimately, to support and respond to these signaling and metabolic programs, both the tumor and
stromal cell epigenomes are reprogrammed, leading to cellular heterogeneity and plasticity that restricts durable
therapy responses. Each of these programs promote resistance to a broad range of therapeutics, including
chemotherapies, targeted therapies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 The central hypothesis of this program is that pancreatic cancer has co-opted an integrated network
of epigenetic programs, paracrine signaling pathways, and metabolic adaptations to promote tumor
survival and therapeutic resistance. Building upon the investigators’ complementary expertise in epigenetics,
cell signaling, and metabolic adaptations, as well as common interests in pancreatic cancer, this program seeks
to understand the interactions that hinder PDA therapeutic responses, with the ultimate goal of identifying
vulnerabilities that can be exploited and targeted to overcome drug resistance. Importantly, the program will
utilize advanced mono- and co-culture organoid systems, cutting-edge mouse models, novel therapeutics,
single-cell approaches, and human clinical specimens to delineate the contributions of both tumor cells and their
stromal support network to therapeutic resistance. Moreover, proposed cooperative and innovative approach will
reveal how these resistance nodes are integrated and can be targeted to improve therapeutic outcomes in PDA."
10883559,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 1: Epigenetics
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a devastating disease with a disturbing rise in incidence. The poor
prognosis of PDA is attributed, in large part, to inherent resistance to conventional chemo- and immuno-
therapies. Multifactorial contributions from tumor intrinsic and extrinsic epigenomic programs, an elaborate
network of cell-cell communications within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and complex metabolic
adaptations compound to make PDA refractory to the current arsenal of therapies. Proposed experiments use
both pharmacological and genetic targeting of Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) to determine the
contributions of epigenetically encoded programs to therapeutic resistance. Aim 1 expands on the lab’s finding
that HDAC inhibition (HDACi) leads to a downregulation of DNA damage response pathway genes. The ability
of HDACi to sensitize both organoid and mouse models of PDA to DNA damaging agents is tested by employing
a nanoparticle delivery system that circumvents systemic HDAC inhibitor toxicities in vivo. Given preliminary
evidence that HDACi upregulates autophagy, a known mediator of therapeutic resistance, the ability of
autophagy inhibition to potentiate responses to HDACi (and combinations with DNA damaging agents) is tested
in collaboration with Project 3. Moreover, interrogation of a human organoid bank will delineate how different
mutational profiles impact sensitivities to HDACi and DNA damage. Aim 2 delineates the contribution of HDAC-
regulated epigenetic programs in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a heterogenous cell type within the TME,
to PDA outcomes. Preliminary data identifies HDAC1 as the primary HDAC underlying CAF responses to
pharmacological HDACi in vitro. Here, a genetic approach is taken to determine how HDAC1 loss in fibroblasts
impacts CAF functional heterogeneity, tumor growth, and chemoresistance in vivo. Collaborative efforts with
Project 2 elucidate how HDACi influences stromal support of tumor growth and chemoresistance through
alterations in CAF-derived soluble factors, including LIF. In addition, the molecular mechanisms by which HDACi
rewires the epigenome in specific CAF subpopulations is delineated. Lastly, Aim 3 builds on preliminary findings
that HDACi sensitizes PDA mouse models to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI). In collaboration with Project 3,
the ability of HDACi and autophagy blockade to synergize in promoting ICI responses through convergent
regulation of MHC-I is tested. The possibility of enhancing anti-tumor immunity by inducing immunological cell
death through the combination of HDACi and DNA damaging agents is also explored. In collaboration with
Project 2, how STAT signaling in inflammatory CAF populations influences anti-tumor immunity elicited by
HDACi and ICI is defined. Finally, to determine how HDACi reprograms immunomodulatory features in human
PDA, biopsies from a completed clinical trial combining HDACi and anti-PD-1 ICI are analyzed via digital spatial
profiling. Together, these studies provide critical insight into the epigenetic mechanisms underlying therapeutic
resistance in PDA and explore novel treatment strategies with the potential to improve patient outcomes."
10852969,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most common complication following open heart surgery, with
an incidence of up to 50%. It is associated with significant morbidity, including stroke, heart failure, and
hemodynamic compromise. For the treatment of POAF, there are two strategies, either rhythm control (restoring
and maintaining sinus rhythm) or rate control (controlling ventricular rate). Medications used to maintain sinus
rhythm are largely ineffective, and those used to control ventricular rates during POAF often cause hypotension.
Therefore, to improve management of POAF, a non-pharmacologic treatment strategy could be implemented.
The current non-pharmacologic treatment of POAF is direct current (DC) cardioversion, which is often needed
to treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable. However, DC cardioversion is often ineffective, as the POAF
usually returns quickly. Although a recent clinical trial showed that rhythm control and rate control are equivalent
in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay, and complication rates, a longer duration of POAF is associated with
worsened long-term survival and risk of AF recurrence. The lack of satisfactory treatment of POAF is due in large
part to our insufficient understanding of its mechanism. In our canine sterile pericarditis model (an experimental
counterpart to POAF), we demonstrated that activation and proliferation of epicardial inflammation occurring in
the atria produces a loss of epicardial myocytes and an altered distribution of connexins 40 and 43. These
changes are associated with non-uniform slowing of conduction, thus creating the vulnerable substrate for the
spontaneous initiation and maintenance of POAF. Our epicardial mapping studies in this model demonstrated
that POAF is caused by a reentrant circuit circulating around pulmonary veins. Our recent study in patients with
POAF after open heart surgery showed that atrial electrograms during POAF recorded from selected left atrial
(LA) sites demonstrated regular cycle lengths, consistent with a LA reentrant circuit similar to our canine model.
Therefore, like other reentrant arrhythmias, the POAF rhythm has the potential to be pace terminated (rhythm
control). When there is another mechanism maintaining POAF, a rate control approach using fat pad stimulation
could be used to control the ventricular rate during POAF. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that when
POAF is due to a reentrant mechanism, it can be terminated by a non-pharmacologic rhythm control strategy
(overdrive pacing); when POAF is due to other mechanisms, it can be managed by a non-pharmacologic rate
control approach (atrioventricular node fat pad stimulation). The hypothesis to be tested has three specific aims:
Aim 1 is to develop non-pharmacologic approaches in our canine model. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that
POAF is due to an anatomical reentrant circuit in patients after open heart surgery. Using entrainment pacing
during POAF, we will verify the existence of a reentrant circuit. Aim 3 is to test the hypothesis that POAF can be
managed by a patient-specific non-pharmacologic approach. Insights from our proposed studies will change the
paradigm for the treatment of POAF, and contribute to improved clinical outcomes in these patients."
10851799,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The long-term goal of this training program is to develop members of a diverse workforce with rigorous training
in an area of biomedical science and to foster a deep understanding of the principles of pharmacology to create
scientists who will be well positioned to participate in the process of moving basic science discoveries to much
needed therapies. This training will be accomplished in an interdisciplinary and inclusive environment that brings
together trainees from multiple institutions who represent a broad range of scientific interests and a shared desire
to understand the principles that underlie the development of safe and effective therapies. A cohort of 3 trainees
will be appointed for the second and third year of their graduate training, a stage in their training where
pharmacology-specific training is best delivered and solidified. We aim to train scientists equipped with the
principles of the discipline of pharmacology who are uniquely prepared to identify and solve research questions
in the biomedical sciences. Mastery of the principles of pharmacology will allow trainees to serve as leaders in
transitioning discoveries into therapies. To this end we have developed a predoctoral training program that will:
provide each trainee with the foundational tenants of the discipline of pharmacology such as receptor theory,
drug metabolism, and pharmacokinetics; develop the professional skills necessary for success; support
individual research mentoring that provides directed research in an area of biomedical science of interest to the
trainee alongside discipline-specific training; and evaluate the attainment of individual trainee and program goals.
Timely and actionable feedback on the progress of trainees is provided by a competency-based assessment
plan developed in collaboration with a select group of like-minded predoctoral training programs. All facets of the
proposed program are supported by a comprehensive evaluation plan designed to both assure the development
of individual trainees and provide feedback to improve the overall training program. These experiences are
supplemented to build competence in research ethics, scientific rigor, presentation of scientific data, and
assessment of data. We convey to trainees the expectation and the tools to pursue life-long learning as an
essential component for success. Professionalism will be intentionally addressed to impart skills in areas such
as communication, teamwork, mentoring, and self-assessment in order to aid in the development of resilience,
integrity, and leadership. These program aims are supported by longstanding strengths that include the history
of collaboration amongst the partner institutions, the past success of trainees, and a dynamic, intellectually
diverse research environment that supports pharmacological investigation. Our goal is to produce trainees who
will become leaders in careers found in academic and industrial research, government and regulatory affairs,
and education."
10836379,"The tick Ixodes scapularis transmits several pathogens of relevance to public health,
including Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic
anaplasmosis), B. miyamotoi (tick-borne relapsing fever), Babesia microti (babesiosis) and Powassan virus
(tick-borne encephalitis). To date, while diverse areas of immunity have been studied in insects, the
underpinnings of the tick immune system are in its infancy, and the molecules involved in microbial sensing
remain chiefly undefined. Similarly, the molecular characterization of tick immune cells or hemocytes remains
mostly elusive. Over the previous funding period, we discovered a non-canonical immune deficiency (IMD)
network in I. scapularis and showed that the IMD pathway is important against B. burgdorferi and A.
phagocytophilum infection. Specifically, we uncovered the role of molecules that act on the I. scapularis IMD
pathway and provided mechanistic support for an observation that the immune system of ticks is fundamentally
different than insects. We made substantial progress in addressing the three specific aims, which resulted in
several peer-reviewed publications. For this R01 project (competing renewal), we will build on our earlier
findings and investigate the nexus between metabolism and immunology. Our central hypothesis states that
changes in metabolic status impact the immune system and microbial infection of ticks. Accordingly, in Aim #1
of this proposal, we will characterize the signaling flexibility of the IMD pathway in ticks. The classical textbook
definition of an immune pathway consists of a fixed stack of proteins that amplifies the immune signal from a
receptor to an effector. We will reveal that the tick IMD pathway is malleable and reprograms itself upon
metabolic changes and/or microbial infection. In Aim #2 of this grant application, we will categorize tick
hemocyte populations under distinct metabolic and microbial conditions through a platform that involves
coupling of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with a monoclonal antibody screening strategy. This
major resource to the vector biology community will show that metabolism and microbial infection affect tick
hemocyte biology. In Aim #3 of this submission, we will assess whether metabolism affects fitness parameters
associated with the life cycle of I. scapularis. We will also evaluate transstadial and transgenerational passage
of microbes in ticks. Altogether, this R01 project will demonstrate that bioenergetic processes likely define cost-effective
and/or energetically expensive tick-microbe interactions."

 The kidney is patterned along a cortical to medullary axis with specific segments of the nephron,
collecting duct and vasculature all lying adjacent to each other in histologically distinct domains. In order for a
kidney to function, different cell types from different cellular lineages must form at the same anatomical
location. Although there has been some insight into how the individual lineages become patterned (such as
proximal distal patterning of the nephron), how the different cell types/lineages coordinate their development
resulting in the global patterning of the organ is unknown.
 We have recently found that the renal interstitial cells show extensive heterogeneity and patterning
along the cortical/medullary axis of a newborn mouse kidney[1]. The patterned domains of the renal interstitium
precisely map to the different anatomical domains within the kidney. How the different interstitial cell types
arise and what role they play in kidney development/function are unknown. We hypothesize that the
interstitium functions to relay and integrate signals from the different lineages and in turn, reinfources
and integrates the differentiation of the renal parenchyma along the cortical/ medullary axis. Using
bioinformatic analysis of single cell RNA-Seq data, we have identified unique transcriptional signatures for the
different interstitial cell types. This information will allow us to understand how the pattern is established as well
as its function. In this proposal, we will focus on the specification and function of a sub-population of interstitial
cells we will refer to as the proximal tubule (PT) interstitium.
 In this proposal, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying specification of a subpopulation of renal
fibroblasts we refer to as the proximal tubules interstitium (PT interstitium). Notch/Rbpj and Yap/Taz
transcription factors are both active within this population and ablation of either pathway using Foxd1Cre has
revealed overlapping roles in the specification of this cell type. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the PT
interstitium is necessary for the maturation of the adjacent proximal tubules. We hypothesize that the PTs
and/or endothelia produce Notch/Rbpj and Yap/Taz activators and that cells with overlapping pathway
activation become PT intersitium. The PT interstitium produces signals that promote the
differentiation/maturation of the PTs. This crosstalk allows the co-maturation and integration of the proximal
tubules and other cortical cell types. We further hypothesize that disruption of normal cortical-medullary pattern
in renal organoids leads to defects in Yap/Taz and/or Notch/Rbpj signaling and contributes to the lack of
nephron maturation in these tissues. These hypotheses will be tested here. Completion of these aims will open
up an entirely new field of kidney interstitial biology that will have a long and lasting impact on the multiple
fields including kidney development, kidney disease, tissue engineering and kidney injury/regeneration."
10843792,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Precise replication of DNA is required to maintain genome stability. Replication forks face many obstacles from
both endogenous and exogenous sources that result in fork stalling or breakage threatening genome integrity.
The double strand break repair pathway, homologous recombination, has critical roles at stalled replication forks
independent of double strand break repair. The importance of this pathway is highlighted by patients with
inherited chromosomal instability orders and cancer predisposition syndromes. Although an intense area of
study, the mechanistic role of recombination proteins at replication forks is still poorly understood. A
comprehensive understanding of the replication response is critical for the understanding the molecular
mechanisms of human disease and to lead to development of novel therapeutics for patients harboring defects
in replication response genes. The long-term goal of the PI to elucidate the roles of recombination proteins in
the replication stress response. Here we will elucidate the role of recombination proteins at hydroxyurea-stalled
replication forks in two distinct projects. In Project 1, we use a powerful separation-of-function allele of the central
recombination enzyme, RAD51, to determine how RAD51 protects the integrity of the replication fork during
unchallenged and stressed conditions using a combination of genetic, molecular biology and proteomic
approaches. In Project 2, we propose a series of experiments to investigate the role of additional recombination
accessory factors in the replication response. Preliminary data from our lab has uncovered a novel role for
recombination proteins in protecting the integrity of stalled replication forks. We will test our current models
through mechanistic dissection of the replication stress response pathway using genetic and molecular
approaches. The work presented here will lay the foundation for future studies involving the elucidation of
molecular mechanisms of recombination proteins involved in the replication stress response. The completion of
this work will lead to not only a better of understanding of the role recombination proteins play at stalled
replication forks, but will also provide molecular insight into how disruption of this pathway results in human
disease. A complete understanding of this pathway is essential for development of therapeutics for patients with
inherited genome instability disorders and cancer that target the cellular replication response."

 Adult stem cells are the agents of organ renewal, remodeling and repair. Their hallmark ability to
concomitantly self-renew and produce terminal progeny enables lifelong maintenance of organ form and
function. At any given point in time, stem cells receive an ever-changing panoply of local and systemic signals
that reinforce stemness, activate division, or direct cellular fate as needed to respond to the tissue’s evolving
needs. These signals are deployed across space and time to marshal diverse stem cell behaviors for
coordinated, organ-scale outputs such as tissue homeostasis. Such emergent properties are fundamental to
the biology of adult tissues and essential for human health—yet, our grasp of their workings is rudimentary.
 My lab seeks to uncover the cellular mechanisms that underlie the robustness and flexibility of adult organ
maintenance. The goal of our MIRA program is to build a comprehensive framework for understanding how
each individual cell is guided by local and systemic signals for a net result of cellular equilibrium at the organ
scale. Our model system is the adult Drosophila midgut, a stem cell-based, tubular epithelial organ that is
functionally equivalent to the vertebrate stomach and small intestine. Our approach leverages unique live
imaging capabilities—pioneered in our lab—and precision genetic tools to illuminate real-time cell dynamics in
vivo and to probe the mechanisms that tune these dynamics.
 Here, we focus on three questions with broad significance to stem cell-based epithelial organs: 1) How
does the spatial distribution of stem cells––which we find is non-random, due to autonomous stem cell motility–
–impact the efficiency and robustness of organ turnover? 2) What are the real-time spatial kinetics of the EGF
feedback signals that equilibrate stem cell divisions and differentiated cell death, and does ectopic
manipulation of these kinetics support or negate a point-source model for organ size control? 3) How do new,
differentiating cells, which are born outside of the epithelium’s sealed network of occluding junctions, integrate
seamlessly into the organ as they differentiate?
 These studies build upon and expand our R01-funded work on organ-scale stem cell dynamics. Since the
cellular life cycle is a universal feature of self-renewing organs, the tunable, population-level mechanisms that
we uncover in the Drosophila midgut will provide a template for thinking about more complex organs, including
those in humans."

Research over the last decades has uncovered epigenetic mechanisms that precisely regulate the genome. For
instance, histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) shape the local chromatin landscape of human cells to
establish permissive and repressive regions within the genome to orchestrate DNA transcription, replication, and
repair. Nevertheless, there is still a great deal that we do not understand about how the cell integrates signals
from inside and outside itself to coordinate proper gene expression. In addition to the classic signaling pathways
that couple metabolism to transcription (e.g., nuclear receptors, kinases), chromatin directly “senses” metabolic
status through the availability of metabolites that are converted to histone PTMs. Since metabolic dysregulation
is a component of nearly every disease, understanding how these altered metabolic pathways impact epigenetic
regulation and vice versa is critical for developing new and effective disease interventions. However, the
incredible complexity and dynamic nature of metabolic pathways and chromatin PTM signaling has made it
difficult to characterize the molecular-level details of this link between metabolism and chromatin. To tackle this
problem, my lab is creating novel chemical tools to determine how a particular subset of histone PTMs called
acylations are regulated by acyl-CoA metabolism and how these PTMs lead to specific effects on gene
expression. We are developing acyl-CoA biosensors to determine how acyl-CoA dynamics change in response
to cellular conditions and how compartmentalization of acyl-CoA metabolism occurs, particularly with respect to
the nuclear compartment and histone acylation. Moreover, our biosensors will similarly expand our
understanding of acyl-CoA metabolism under both normal and disease conditions and will enable the
identification of the acyl-CoA-producing enzymes and acyltransferases that regulate specific histone acylations.
To determine how histone acylations impact gene expression, we are developing affinity-based probes to identify
proteins that bind to histone acylations. By identifying these binding proteins, we will be able to assign specific
gene regulatory functions to these PTMs. With this information, we will be able to develop new therapeutic
strategies to intercept communication between metabolism and the genome at the acyl-CoA and histone
acylation levels to precisely reprogram these signaling pathways in disease."

Antiseizure medications are one of the most commonly prescribed teratogens. In pregnant women with
epilepsy, continuation of antiseizure medications and dose increases are often necessary to prevent
seizure worsening, but need to be balanced against the fetal risks of in utero exposure, such as congenital
malformations and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Additionally, breastfeeding introduces another
route of drug exposure to the infant and can affect child development. Although measurement of drug
concentration in plasma is thought to reflect drug concentrations at the site of action in the mother, it is more
difficult to translate the overall exposure to the fetus or determine the full extent of the exposure to the child
through breastfeeding. Physiological-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) methods will be used to advance a
precision medicine approach to characterize drug concentration-time profiles at the tissue level allowing
evaluation of target doses needed to achieve optimal drug exposure in women with epilepsy, taking into
account drug exposure to the fetus during pregnancy and to the breastfeeding infant. Information from both
basic science and clinical studies will be used to develop, evaluate, and validate PBPK models. This grant will
use previously collected data and new measures from existing samples in the clinical study MONEAD, animal
data, in vitro studies, and a new external validation cohort with sampling at critical timepoints (not previously
obtained) to determine the mechanistic basis of alterations in antiseizure medication concentrations during
pregnancy and lactation. These data can then be combined with outcome data in other clinical studies to
expand our knowledge of drug response and safety in women and children during two very vulnerable times,
pregnancy and lactation."
10845469,"Project Summary
Linking genotype to phenotype by predicting the functional effects of genomic variation is crucial to realizing the
potential of genomic medicine. Over the past two decades, consortium efforts have characterized common and
rare population-scale genetic variation and functional gene regulatory elements across cell types. More recently,
single-cell technologies have enabled organism-scale surveys of molecular cell states. The availability of these
three data types means that the goal of general models to predict the effects of variants is finally within reach.
Currently, integrating these diverse biological data sets to build predictive models is difficult. While resources
such as RegulomeDB help researchers annotate variants with putative regulatory function, they often lack cell
type specificity and predict variant function in a general sense. Similarly, GTEx effectively links specific variants
to changes in gene expression, but these variants are primarily SNPs, and the predicted effects are mostly
pairwise interactions. Furthermore, previous efforts rely primarily on bulk measurements, with limited exploration
of the impact of genomic variation at the single-cell level. We propose quantitative shifts in cellular state as a
new paradigm for defining and predicting variant function. Single-cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data from
healthy individuals provide a reference atlas of cell states. By comparing cell state distributions against this
reference, we can identify quantitative shifts resulting from genetic variation and explore these deviations as
potential disease states. We will then build models to predict shifts in cell state by combining single-cell data with
background germline genetic variation, chromatin structure, and supporting functional data."

Exercise is one of the most promising methods for positively influencing neurocognitive function in late
adulthood. Yet, despite this recognition, several major knowledge gaps preclude the ability to broadly prescribe
exercise to prevent or treat cognitive impairment. This R35 proposal includes a series of innovative and
potentially groundbreaking studies that will contribute to major advancements in the field of exercise and brain
health. The studies that we describe in this proposal would be led by several highly promising junior scientists
with the support of an experienced and dedicated mentorship team. The conceptual and scientific framework
for the hypotheses described in this proposal orbit around three major challenges facing the field of exercise
and cognitive aging: (1) We have a poor understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise influences
cognitive function in late adulthood, (2) We have a poor understanding of the factors that moderate, or explain
individual variation in, the response to exercise, and (3) We do not understand the factors that predict long-
term adoption of exercise behavior and how to reduce barriers and enhance incentives for individuals who find
it challenging to continue to exercise. Despite the clear benefits of an active lifestyle, most people fail to meet
public health recommendations for exercise. The more we know about the factors that predict and enhance
long-term adoption of exercise, the more we will know about whether exercise influences incidence of
Alzheimer’s Disease and best practices for prescribing and maintaining exercise for the prevention and
treatment of cognitive impairment. We propose to conduct secondary analysis of banked data from two
rigorous and well-controlled supervised exercise randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and to conduct a 3-year
follow-up of >570 participants from both of these RCTs of exercise to assess cognitive, cardiorespiratory
fitness, and physical activity levels. In particular, we propose to examine whether exercise-induced changes in
cardiometabolic and sleep measures mediate exercise-derived benefits to cognitive and brain outcomes. We
will also target moderators of exercise including APOE genotype and racial disparities to better characterize
which individual difference variables influence the magnitude of effects of exercise on brain health. Finally, we
propose a discovery aim that would leverage our rich measurement of participants at the genetic,
physiological, brain, cognitive, and socioemotional levels to perform predictive modeling to forecast long-term
adoption of exercise (or barriers prohibiting long-term adoption). In short, this research proposal describes a
broad and ambitious line of work that will produce groundbreaking and innovative studies to address significant
gaps in our understanding of exercise and brain health in late adulthood. The aims target several major
AD/ADRD milestones identified by NIH and will position junior scientists in leadership roles to advance the field
forward in significant and pioneering ways."
10852011,"ABSTRACT
Eukaryotic cells use clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) to internalize nutrients, receptors and
recycle their plasma membrane. Defects in endocytosis are implicated in various diseases such
as cancer, neuropathies, and metabolic syndromes, and the CME machinery can be hijacked by
pathogens to infect cells. Deforming the membrane into ~50-nm endocytic vesicles requires the
choregraphed assembly and disassembly of 60+ proteins. Because the CME machinery
continuously exchanges and CME is diffraction-limited, the precise molecular mechanisms for
force production have remained elusive. Models based on actin polymerization have been
proposed but the amount of force they can realistically produce is 1-2 orders of magnitude too
low. In this project, we will build on the discoveries we made during last funding period to study
new mechanisms of force production at the CME site and determine mechanisms for the
regulation of membrane tension, which is a key parameter for endocytosis. In aim 1, we
hypothesize that crosslinking highly dynamic actin filaments can produce large amounts of force
in a sustained way. We will characterize the biophysical properties of fimbrin in vitro, use
mathematical modeling to uncover mechanisms of sustained force production by crosslinking of
dynamic actin filaments, and test the model’s predictions by single-molecule tracking at the
CME site. Aim 2 will focus on discovering the molecular mechanisms underlying the fast
exchange of endocytic proteins we discovered during last funding period. We will test different
hypotheses using mathematical modeling, measure the dependence of fimbrin’s detachment
rate as a function of force, and determine whether the exchange of endocytic protein depends
on the stage of endocytosis. In aim 3, we will characterize mechanisms for the regulation of
plasma membrane tension and its influence on CME. We will use optical tweezers to determine
whether membrane tension is locally and temporally regulated and use mathematical modeling
to understand how a local reduction in membrane tension modulates the forces required for
endocytosis. Altogether, our results will uncover new paradigms for dynamic force production
and membrane tension control that will impact a variety of cellular processes."
10831004,"The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of over 80 neurodegenerative conditions and the most
common cause of inherited spasticity and associated disability. This K08 proposal focuses on prototypical
forms of HSP in children caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants in four genes that encode subunits of the
adaptor protein complex 4 (AP-4): AP4B1, AP4M1, AP4E1, and AP4S1. Progressive degeneration of the
cortico-spinal tracts renders most children with AP-4-associated HSP wheelchair-dependent by the age of 10
years. Currently, there are no therapies that halt disease progression, and few patients are known to have
survived into adulthood, highlighting the urgency for research into the fundamental biology of HSP.
The AP-4 complex is crucial for the intracellular trafficking of transmembrane proteins, including the
autophagy-related protein ATG9A. How altered trafficking of ATG9A leads to impaired neurodevelopment and
axonal degeneration and how ATG9A distribution can be restored is currently unknown. In this proposal, I will
address this unmet question by developing neuronal models of AP-4 deficiency and testing novel modulators
of AP-4-dependent protein trafficking. In preliminary experiments, we have systematically screened small
molecule modulators of ATG9A trafficking using a cell-based phenotypic assay that measures ATG9A
distribution as a surrogate of AP-4 function. We identified several modulators of ATG9A distribution. I will test
the hypothesis that these restore trafficking and function of ATG9A in vitro in neurons derived from AP-4-HSP
patients and in vivo in an ap4b1-/- zebrafish model.
This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of AP-4 in HSP
to expand the breadth and depth of understanding the role of protein trafficking and autophagy in this group of
diseases. The goal is the establishment of a cross-organismal screening platform to identify and develop novel
modulators of protein trafficking for the treatment of HSP.
The candidate is currently a resident in Child Neurology at the Department of Neurology at Boston Children's
Hospital and Harvard Medical School. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate's previous research on
protein trafficking, autophagy and neurodegeneration and integrates new domains of expertise in cell biology,
advanced microscopy, and iPSC-derived neurons and genetically-engineered zebrafish to model human
diseases. These skills are reflected in his mentoring team consisting of primary mentor, Dr. Mustafa Sahin, and
a scientific advisory committee consisting of Dr. Craig Blackstone, Dr. Thomas Schwarz, Dr. Annapurna Poduri
and Dr. Leonard Zon. The proposed experiments and didactic work will position the candidate with a unique
set of cross-disciplinary skills that will enable his transition to independence as a physician-scientist in the field
of translational neuroscience in childhood-onset neurological diseases."
10874407,"Project Summary. Catalysis has long been a potent force for advancing biomedical research by enabling the
construction of biologically important molecules with ever-increasing speed, efficiency, and versatility. One of
the most potent driving forces for progress in the area of catalysis has been the discovery of new catalytic
platforms and concepts. The proposed research program is broadly focused on advancing the area of catalysis
through the development of novel catalytic platforms, concepts, and methods. In particular, we have developed
two generic catalytic strategies with broad applicability over a wide array of reaction types. In the first program,
we have helped to pioneer the area of electrophotocatalysis, which combines the power of light and electrical
energy within a single catalyst to promote challenging chemical reactions. Especially, we have introduced
trisaminocyclopropenium (TAC) ions as a novel class of electrophotocatalyst; these catalysts have proven to
be useful for a number of transformations, including C–H bond functionalizations and olefin derivatizations. The
current application seeks to leverage electrophotocatalysis to realize other challenging, unprecedented
reactions, especially those requiring very high redox potentials or involving multiple redox events. In the
second program, we have pioneered the area of catalytic carbonyl-olefin metathesis, using hydrazine catalysis.
This foundational capability enables a wide range of potentially advantageous synthetic methods. The current
application seeks to make major advances to this program by designing highly reactive, next-generation
catalysts that greatly expand the scope of substrates that can be engaged. We also aim to apply this mode of
catalysis to useful new chemical methods, and to develop related catalytic platforms using these general
principles. These and other investigations into the use of novel ideas in catalysis will continue to serve as a
stimulus for advancements in chemical synthesis."
10848270,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Congenital urinary tract obstruction (UTO) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end stage renal
disease in children. Current management strategies cannot prevent chronic kidney disease progression.
Recently published data from my F32-funded postdoctoral studies identify renal urothelial remodeling as a
protective adaptation to UTO. Both congenital and acquired UTO trigger the formation of Uroplakin (Upk)
expressing urothelial cells (UC) that synthesize a bladder-like urothelial plaque. Depletion of urothelial plaque in
mice with congenital UTO accelerates renal parenchymal loss, functional impairment, and death – attesting to
key roles for Upk-UCs in preventing obstructive nephropathy. A greater understanding of renal urothelial
development and repair may lead to therapies aimed at attenuating obstructive kidney disease. Fundamental
knowledge gaps exist, however, in our understanding of the formation of Upk-UCs during development and UTO.
I have recently demonstrated that Keratin 5 (K5)-expressing UCs differentiate into Upk-UCs during development
and following UTO. This application takes direct aim at the hypothesis that K5-UCs are progenitors whose fate
is governed by an intrinsic molecular program that varies over time and in response to injury. The anticipated
outcome of this research is to establish molecular mechanisms that govern K5-UC progenitor activity, and to
determine the contributions of K5-UC progenitors during development and following UTO. In Aim 1, I will
investigate whether temporally restricted K5-UC progenitor activity is cell-intrinsic using organoid assays;
examine the role of Notch signaling in the regulation of K5-UC fate; and define molecular programs that regulate
urothelial development and repair. In Aim 2, I will investigate the significance of the K5-UCs by evaluating the
impact of depletion and expansion of K5-UCs on urothelial development and repair during UTO. The studies
proposed in this application will reveal the cellular and molecular basis of Upk-UC formation – with the hypothesis
that K5-UCs form Upk-UCs in a Notch dependent manner. Successful completion of these aims will provide the
foundation for the development of therapies that target K5-UCs for differentiation to attenuate obstructive kidney
disease in patients with UTO. In fulfilling these Aims, I will develop critical skills in rare cell isolation, organoid
development, signaling pathway analysis, bioinformatics, renal physiology and pathophysiology of obstructive
nephropathy. Mastery of these skills, in combination with structured career development activities under the
guidance of my mentors and research advisory team, will prepare me to successfully compete for R01 funding
and launch my career as an independent scientist focused on developing therapies aimed at attenuating chronic
kidney disease progression in children with UTO."

The mission of the Baylies lab is to deliver basic research findings that will support better therapies across a
range of muscle diseases. Our goals are the identification of genes and mechanisms that are essential for the
formation and healthy functioning of skeletal muscle, and where these mechanisms go awry in disease states
such as muscular disorders (nemaline and centronuclear myopathies), muscle wasting (cachexia, aging), and
soft tissue cancer (rhabdomyosarcoma). Specifically, the lab aims to understand key processes that lead to
skeletal muscle: cell fate commitment, cell-cell fusion, movement and positioning of organelles such as the
nucleus, and muscle fiber growth and maturation. That research is conducted by developing and combining
novel genetic, cell biological, imaging, molecular and mathematical approaches, using Drosophila and
mammalian muscle cells. Our current investigations focus on a fundamental question: what determines muscle
cell size? The mechanisms that control cell size are poorly understood. This is particularly true for a skeletal
muscle cell, which may have hundreds of nuclei and is among the largest cells in the human body. Skeletal
muscle cells have a remarkable capacity to increase their size in response to exercise (hypertrophy), and to
decrease in size upon inactivity, aging, or disease (atrophy). Our work in Drosophila has revealed critical nuclear
parameters (number, DNA content, size, activity) that can each be adjusted and coordinated by the muscle cell
to generate a particular size. We have also found that the many nuclei in a muscle cell vary in number and
activity along the length of a muscle fiber. Key questions we are pursuing over the next five years include: How
does a muscle cell generates these regional differences yet globally coordinate the nuclei within a single cell?
Are such differences apparent in other organelles? Similarly, what are the specific signals and mechanisms that
establish and maintain nuclear identity along the muscle cell; what are the contributions of each nucleus to their
local cytoplasmic domain and to the entire muscle cell? How does each nucleus set up its cytoplasmic area and
are there regional differences? Finally, under conditions of hypertrophy or atrophy, how are nuclear and
cytoplasmic identities and the compensation/communication mechanisms impacted? Altogether, our work will
identify defining parameters of muscle cell size under normal, hypertrophic and atrophic conditions, and their
physiological range required for muscle function. Our studies will reveal general principles of cell size regulation,
provide insight to how improper regulation of these processes results in disease, and inform regenerative
medicine aimed at muscle."

We have made strategic changes in our environmental health sciences training program in response to the
announced restructuring and redirection of NIEHS training programs. Participating Centers, Institutes, and
Schools and the members of the training faculty provide critical resources for cutting edge basic science, clinical
research, computational sciences and public health. Environmental health science partnerships have resulted in
a very successful NIEHS training program in environmental health sciences. Our renewal proposal incorporates
and integrates several Schools, Centers, and Institutes, including the new Envirome Institute, the recently funded
NIEHS P42 Superfund Research Program and the soon to be funded NIEHS P30 Core Center in Environmental
Health Sciences. We propose a substantially improved predoctoral and postdoctoral training program that serves
as an umbrella for interdisciplinary and integrated approaches to environmental health sciences. The training
program will support six predoctoral and three postdoctoral trainees. Initial student recruitment and funding for
predoctoral trainees is provided by the University of Louisville Integrated Programs in the Biomedical Sciences
recruitment gateway. As in the previous cycle, predoctoral trainees will not be recruited directly into the
environmental health sciences training program. All faculty mentors are asked to nominate trainees who have
completed an approved dissertation proposal with a defined focus in environmental health sciences research.
Faculty mentors will be asked to nominate either existing postdoctoral fellows or from trainees to be recruited.
Teams of mentors (basic and clinical scientists or basic and population-based scientists) will be particularly
encouraged to emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary training and translation of basic science findings to
the patient and/or community. Our training program facilitates multidisciplinary approaches for effective
intervention and interfaces exceptionally well with the NIH Roadmap as well as with the strategic plans of NIEHS
and the University of Louisville."

I am an assistant professor in the department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine, where my practice is focused on neurotology and lateral skull base surgery. I am applying
for a mentored surgeon-scientist career development award (CDA) to obtain further training in robotics, deep
learning and computer vision. This will further my long-term career goals of improving neurotologic surgical
outcomes through novel applications of engineering methods and ultimately to investigate semi-autonomous,
robotic interventions in the inner ear and skull base which are beyond the limits of the human hand alone.
 Operating in the temporal bone and lateral skull base is technically demanding due to complex three-
dimensional anatomy, small working spaces and delicate neurovascular structures. Many of these challenges
are ideally suited to semi-autonomous surgical platforms to augment a surgeon’s skills with robotic and image-
guided assistance. Despite the widespread implementation of robotic surgery and image guidance in other areas
of the body, the field of neurotology has had relatively little adoption of this technology. We believe one reason
for this is the precise registration needed in this field, where millimeter differences differentiate a successful from
a catastrophic result. This CDA proposes expanding on my prior work investigating cooperative control
robotics and virtual safety barriers by using computer vision and deep learning networks to develop highly
accurate surgical image registration. This CDA aims to provide me with multi-disciplinary training in the
departments of Otolaryngology, Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. Specific training goals include:
(1) Training in robotics, statistical shape modeling and computer tomography landmark segmentation, (2)
Training in deep learning networks and computer vision video image registration, (3) Integrating this training,
with my knowledge of temporal bone and skull base surgery to develop into an independent investigator (4)
Pursue additional training in the ethical and responsible conduct of research.
 The research plan addresses the hypothesis that virtual safety barriers can be accurately enforced by a
cooperative control robot, and computer vision methods can be used to automate accurate placement and
registration of these safety barriers. I believe that the integration of these techniques will allow for semi-
autonomous surgical methods resulting in improved surgical safety and efficiency. The specific aims of the
proposal are to: (1) Develop and Validate Cooperative Control Robot Enforced Virtual Safety Barriers for Cortical
Mastoidectomy (2) Develop and Test Autonomous Segmentation of Lateral Skull Base Anatomy (3) Develop
Video-Based, Fiducial-less, Surgical Image Registration to Detect and Update the 3-D Position of Temporal
Bone Anatomy from Intraoperative Stereoscopic Microscope Video."

Public health disasters and the drug addiction and overdose epidemic are among the foremost public health
issues facing the United States. Disaster-related disruptions to drug addiction treatment and overdose
prevention services can be life-threatening to people with drug addiction. Public policies form the backbone of
disaster response by delineating what health systems can and cannot do in the midst and aftermath of
disasters. There are several types of state health service delivery policies with the potential to enhance access
to drug addiction treatment and prevent overdose during disasters e.g., state telehealth policies allowing
addiction treatment services to be delivered by phone, as opposed to video conference (a policy that may
benefit people with drug addiction who lack computer and/or high-speed internet access); state harm reduction
policies loosening restrictions on naloxone distribution during disasters; and state policies waiving in-person
methadone dosing requirements and allowing individuals with opioid use disorder to take home a 14-28 days'
supply. The implementation and effects of these policies on addiction treatment and overdose in the disaster
context have not been studied; we will fill this gap by studying these policies in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic. We propose a mixed-methods study using a concurrent-embedded design. In Aims 1-2, we will
conduct a 50-state study using a difference-in-differences approach to examine the effects of the state health
services delivery policies of interest on rates of drug addiction treatment and fatal and non-fatal drug overdose.
Data sources for Aims 1-2 will include 50-state administrative databases capturing services delivered in the
general medical sector (IQVIA LRx/Dx and United Healthcare) and specialty addiction treatment sector
(TEDS), as well as CDC fatal drug overdose data. In Aim 3, we will conduct in-depth qualitative case studies
of eight US states hard-hit by COVID-19, with embedded case studies of local public health and healthcare
systems in urban and rural counties within those states. A strength of the proposed study is its use of a
concurrent embedded mixed-methods strategy, where qualitative case studies (Aim 3) will answer questions
not addressed by the primary quantitative method (Aims 1-2). Our study will yield actionable evidence to
inform policy development and implementation to enhance continuity to addiction treatment and prevent drug
overdose during future disasters."

We are developing micro- and nanofluidic devices to probe virus capsids, bacteria, and extracellular vesicles
at the single-particle level with improved spatial and temporal resolution. Single-particle (or digital)
measurements provide not only improved sensitivity but also insight into population heterogeneity. Information
content is further enhanced by performing these assays in a high-throughput, multiplexed format, where
individual events are tracked, but population statistics are also obtained. We are targeting rare or infrequent
events, which can significantly impact the overall function or fate of a system, because these events are often
obscured when measurements are made on bulk samples. In the first project, we are studying virus capsid
assembly and disassembly. To monitor reactions with capsids, we are designing in-plane nanofluidic devices
with multiple nanopores in series for resistive-pulse sensing, which is a label-free, nondestructive sizing
technique. Resistive-pulse sensing detects events in real time and has sufficient sensitivity to monitor
assembly at biologically relevant concentrations and over a range of reaction conditions. With these
nanofluidic devices, we are evaluating how assembly effectors and chaotropes impact the assembly process
and produce a variety of particle morphologies, including kinetically trapped intermediates and aberrant
structures. In the second project, we are tracking development and aging of bacteria with microfluidic devices
that have integrated nanochannel arrays to physically trap bacteria. The nanochannels confine growth of
bacteria in one dimension, and when coupled with fluorescence microscopy, image analysis is reduced from
a three-dimensional to one-dimensional problem and greatly simplified. Growth and division rates, subcellular
functions, epigenetic effects, and antibiotic response are easily tracked for extended periods of time and
across multiple generations. In the third project, we are profiling N- and O-glycans derived from serum, urine,
and ascites fluid, and their extracellular vesicles. For thorough characterization of these glycans, we are
combining chemical labeling strategies to neutralize and differentiate sialyl linkage isomers with analysis by
microfluidic capillary electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Differences in glycan
sizes, degrees of fucosylation and sialylation, and ratios of sialyl linkage isomers are quantified in these
samples. We are using single-particle techniques to characterize the physical and chemical properties of
extracellular vesicles to correlate these properties with their glycan profiles."

Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) face unique health issues, but studies on SGM health are scarce. In
particular, limited data are available among SGM individuals on age-related conditions such as Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) and related dementias. AD is a fatal degenerative disease with a diverse range of risk factors,
ranging from clinical characteristics to social determinants of health (SDoH). AD patients often progress from
cognitively unimpaired to (possible) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), followed by increasing severity of
dementia with AD clinical syndrome. Nevertheless, evidence suggests there exists heterogeneity in the
progression to AD through multiple intermediate stages. Characterizing the different AD progression pathways
and the associated risk factors is crucial for risk stratification and prevention. On the other hand, the
proliferation of large clinical research networks (CRNs) with real-world data (RWD), including electronic health
records (EHRs), claims, and billing data among others, offers opportunities for generating real-world evidence
(RWE) that will have direct translational impacts on AD prevention and care in the SGM populations.
Nevertheless, there are a number of key research and methodological gaps in using RWD for studying AD in
SGM, including the lack of (1) validated computable phenotypes (CP) and natural language processing (NLP)
tools that can accurately define the SGM populations and extract key patient characteristics and outcomes
(e.g., MoCA scores to determine severity), (2) consideration of the heterogeneity in AD and its progression
pathways, and (3) consideration of AD disparities in SGM populations, especially structured on both individual-
and contextual-level SDoH. Responding to NOT-AG-21-050, we propose to analyze large collections of RWD
in the OneFlorida+ and INSIGHT networks, two CRNs contributing to the national Patient-Centered Clinical
Research Network (PCORnet), to: (1) create real-world longitudinal SGM and AD cohorts that can be followed
by virtue of routine clinical care, (2) model the heterogeneity in AD progression with novel federated machine
learning methods, and (3) examine SGM disparities in AD outcomes (i.e., onset and progression pathways)
and in the causal paths via which AD clinical risk factors and SDoH impact these AD outcomes. Our project is
novel and will have direct translational impact as it provides concrete RWE to fill the knowledge gaps by
examining whether AD disparities exist between SGM (and SGM subgroups) and non-SGM, and identifies
potentially actionable AD risk factors and SDoH significant to SGM and their disparities. The success of this
project will fill important gaps in our knowledge of AD risk and progression pathways in the SGM populations,
and establish a framework for creating RWD-based virtual cohort, which can inform national pragmatic trials
across PCORnet for future SGM aging clinical studies."

population-based longitudinal cohort studies of cognitive aging and dementia from around the world to address
the analytical epidemiology of dementia and pre-dementia syndromes, using harmonized data to conduct pooled
analyses and individual participant data meta-analyses. Since its initial funding by the NIA/NIH in Sep 2017,
COSMIC’s membership has grown to 54 studies from 39 nations, including 35 studies from low- and middle-
income countries (LMIC), with an additional 25 in negotiation, and a combined sample size of 175,199 (85,186
White and 90,013 non-White - 39,610 Asian, 15,476 Black, 34,832 Hispanic, 96 other), expected to grow to
300,000. A large international community of researchers has thus been enabled to collaboratively investigate the
global epidemiology of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. In the next five years, the power of this
unique consortium will be harnessed to map the 12 modifiable risk factors of dementia identified by the 2020
Lancet Commission. Some novel risk and resilience factors will be studied in-depth, the built and economic
environments, air pollution, social health, and frailty. The incidence of MCI and dementia will be determined in
diverse regions and risk models for dementia in specific populations developed. COSMIC will examine the role
of cerebrovascular disease by harmonizing neuroimaging biomarkers. It will study the predictive utility of
genetic markers in non-European populations. It will investigate the diagnostic and disease-monitoring potential
of plasma biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease in diverse populations. COSMIC is forging new collaborations. It
is collaborating with the Davos Alzheimer’s Collaborative (DAC) to develop digital, genetic, and fluid
biomarker-based dementia phenotypes in under-represented populations. In collaboration with Dementias
Platform UK (DPUK), COSMIC is developing the Dementias Platform Australia (DPAU) for sharing
participant level data from COSMIC studies with researchers world-wide. With DPUK and the Alzheimer’s
Disease Data Initiative (ADDI), it is developing an ontology for the curation and harmonization of dementia
related variables for international data-sharing. In collaboration with the Institute of Health Metrics and
Evaluation, COSMIC will document the global burden of risk factors for dementia. In collaboration with the
DAC, DPUK, ADDI and the Global Brain Health Institute (GBHI), it is developing a training and education
program to increase research capacity in LMICs. With its collaborative approach, data sharing, and global
network, COSMIC is creating a demonstrably global epidemiology of dementia that is needed to meet the
ambitious goals of the 2017 World Health Assembly and the hopes of people at risk of dementia everywhere."
10856912,"Sleep disturbances highly prevalent conditions, especially following traumatic brain injury (TBI); ~60% of patients
with TBI have insomnia. Chronic sleep disturbances impair daily functioning, negatively impact quality of life, are
linked to impaired cognition and alertness, and contribute to depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms—
common comorbidities in veterans with TBI. The “gold standard” for insomnia treatment is Cognitive Behavioral
Treatment for Insomnia (CBTi). However, ~40% of individuals with insomnia do not respond to CBTi. In this
study, we will capitalize on an on-going DoD-funded cohort of 160 active-duty personnel with insomnia to test
the overarching hypothesis that among patients with insomnia, those with TBI vs. no-TBI will manifest higher
levels of systemic inflammation and inferior responses to CBTi. Participants will be divided into 4 groups: Group
A (no insomnia, no TBI), Group B (Insomnia only, no TBI), Group C-low (Insomnia + low grade TBI), and Group
C-high (Insomnia + high grade TBI). Participants will age, sex match across all groups and further match with
age-related chronic conditions, and medication history. All participants completed a baseline blood collection
and clinical assessment. Participants diagnosed with insomnia completed a 60-minute CBTi sessions over 6
weeks and returned 12 weeks after baseline enrollment for blood collection and clinical evaluation. Peripheral
blood samples will be sequenced (RNA-seq) at baseline and after CBTi for evaluation of gene expression
profiling and bioinformatics analysis. We will test the following hypothesis:
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that insomnia severity and the corresponding baseline (pre-CBTi) peripheral blood
inflammatory status displays a hierarchy: Groups C-high > C-low > B > A.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the CBTi-associated reductions in insomnia severity will display a hierarchy
(best to worst): group B > C-low > C-high; correspondingly, the associated reduction in inflammatory status will
be most, intermediate, and least in these groups, respectively.
Using well-established bioinformatic approaches in the nominee’s mentor’s laboratory, genes that are
differentially expressed between study groups will be identified, and mechanistic pathways associated with the
proposed hierarchy will be determined. We will utilize a recently developed a strategy to categorize gene
signatures into those that relate to immunocompetence vs. inflammation. With this framework, we anticipate that
expression levels signifying the conjoined high immunocompetence-low inflammation state will be
overrepresented in controls/no-insomnia group vs. those with insomnia. We anticipate that the hallmark of the
insomnia/high grade TBI group to be characterized by low immunocompetence-high inflammation. Improving
sleep is the first step in optimizing rehabilitation strategies and the proposed study will provide novel insights to
help improve sleep in Veterans with and without risk of previous TBIs. These insights may have long-term
implications to the health and well-being of veterans, including identification of potential biomarkers (gene
expression) to assist in prognostication and monitoring treatment. The proposed study will also have a relatively
equal representation of men and women, which can further help inform gender-specific care in the military and
Veteran health care system and for the development of military and Veteran health policy. The long-term
beneficiaries from this study will be individuals with insomnia in the chronic phase of recovery from TBI. The
research proposed coupled with expertise of the mentors, provides the nominee with an unparalleled opportunity
to expand critical skillsets necessary to develop a pragmatic, translational ‘omics’-based sleep medicine program
within the VA system that is broadly applicable to many diseases beyond insomnia."
10862575,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major health problem in the US (especially in the Veteran
population) and alcohol abuse/ALD has increased dramatically during the COVID pandemic. In spite of the
magnitude of this problem, there is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of ALD. In addition, the mechanisms
and regulators of disease progression and severity are incompletely understood. Dietary fats play an important
interactive role with alcohol consumption in ALD pathogenesis, however, the role of specific n3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFAs) in ALD are not well defined. Our central hypothesis is that n3 PUFAs are beneficial in
ALD, in part, via n3-PUFA-derived pro-resolving mediators, which facilitate inflammation resolution,
improvement in the gut-liver axis, and subsequent attenuation of liver injury. We propose that n3 PUFA-
derived resolvin D1 (RvD1) is a potential therapeutic agent in ALD acting via RvD1-FPR2-NEAT1 signaling to
suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines and to promote repair of hepatocellular damage, in part, via enhancement
of pro-restorative macrophages. We postulate that compromised inflammation resolution due to impaired RvD1
production/signaling is a critical nutritional factor contributing to the progression and severity of ALD/alcohol-
associated hepatitis (AH) in humans. The Specific Aims of the proposal are: Aim 1: determine the role and
molecular mechanism(s) underlying n3 PUFA and RvD1 beneficial effects in EtOH-induced liver injury and
resolution of inflammation associated with ALD. We will determine whether beneficial effects occur through an
increase in n3-PUFA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), and RvD1-FPR2 and Neat1-mediated
suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling and reprogramming pro-inflammatory macrophages to a pro-
restorative phenotype. Wild Type (WT), Fpr2-/-, Neat1-/-, and transgenic fat-1 mice (which are able to
endogenously convert n6 to n3 PUFAs) will be used in this Aim. Aim 2: examine the role n3-PUFAs and RvD1
in maintaining gut barrier integrity, and in the resolution of intestinal inflammation in experimental ALD. We will:
i) test in vivo, in animal models, and in vitro, in intestinal organoid culture, whether n3 PUFAs or RvD1 improve
intestinal barrier damage by attenuating intestinal immune dysregulation; ii) test in vivo whether disruption of the
RvD1-FPR2 axis exacerbates, while blocking Neat1 signaling attenuates, intestinal inflammation and alterations
in the gut barrier integrity; and iii) determine the contribution of the gut microbiota to the beneficial effects of n3
PUFAs and RvD1 in experimental ALD. Aim 3: translate and extend our findings in animal models to human
ALD. Utilizing human samples obtained from Veteran AH patients, we will: i) examine plasma SPM levels and
correlate plasma SPM levels with markers of liver injury, systemic inflammation, and intestinal permeability; ii)
evaluate basal and LPS-inducible SPM production in whole blood (ex-vivo system) and blood monocytes; and
iii) test whether RvD1 improves the phagocytosis/efferocytosis capacity of blood monocytes, and determine if
disruption of the RvD1-FPR2 axis will enhance, while silencing of NEAT1 will decrease, pro-inflammatory
cytokine expression in human monocytes. These three aims will define both untested novel mechanisms for ALD
initiation/progression as well as potential novel therapy that could be rapidly initiated for Veterans with ALD."

 IFN was an FDA-approved agent for human cancer therapy and is currently used as exogenous
recombinant protein or protein prodrugs. The use of IFN in human cancer therapy has been limited by the
ineffective dosing and high toxicity. This proposal develops a lipid nanoparticle encapsulated IFN-encoding
DNA nanoplasmid (IFNA13CO01) to force tumor cells to express and produce endogenous IFN13 locally in
the tumor microenvironment. IFNA13CO01 therapy is therefore expected to produce high level of endogenous
IFN13 locally in the tumor site and thus overcomes the ineffective dosing and systemic toxicity issues
associated with the current IFN agents. In the preliminary studies, we determined that type I interferon (IFN-I:
IFN and IFN) expression level is significantly lower in human colorectal carcinoma than in normal colon
tissue. We further determined that IFN-I functions in both tumor cells and T cells are essential for host cancer
immune surveillance. Mechanistically, we determined that IFN-I activates STAT3 that binds to the Gzmb
promoter to activate Gzmb transcription in CTLs. The IFN-I/STAT3/Gzmb axis thus is essential for CTL anti-
tumor function. In addition, we determined that tumor cell expressed PD-L1 (tPD-L1) engages myeloid cell
expressed PD-1 (mPD-1) to antagonize IFN-I and STAT1 signaling to repress Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 to impair CTL
recruitment to lung metastases. Human patient response to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy correlates with
IFN-I response in myeloid cells. We therefore discovered that the tPD-L1/mPD-1/IFN-I/STAT1/Cxcl9-Cxcl10
axis controls CTL tumor infiltration in lung metastasis. Our central hypothesis is that forcing tumor cells to
express and produce endogenous IFN13 in the local tumor microenvironment via IFNA13CO01 therapy is an
effective and yet safe approach to suppress human colorectal tumor growth and progression. We propose to
test our new central hypothesis by pursuing the following 3 specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that tPD-1
engages mPD-1 to inhibit IFI-I signaling to suppress CTL recruitment and function to promote metastatic tumor
growth in human colon cancer patients.; 2) Determine the efficacy of IFNA13CO01 in suppression of
metastatic human colon cancer PDX growth in humanized NSG mice; and 3) Determine IFNA13CO01
biodistribution, toxicology and pharmacokinetics in vivo."
10811578,"The current 2-year career development award (CDA-1) proposal is designed to prepare Dr. Michael
Ruderman, a VA Psychiatrist with foundational knowledge of advanced research methods, for a career in VA
conducting research as a psychiatrist scientist who will advance innovation in suicide prevention and
intervention strategies—identifying and targeting causal mechanisms for suicide that are amenable for
intervention. Dr. Ruderman will accomplish this goal through the pursuit and completion of training activities,
support from an expert mentoring team, and completion of a research project aimed at bridging the gap
between causal inference research methods and clinical knowledge to inform suicide interventions. The CDA-1
project will ultimately generate pilot information about causal factors for suicide risk with refinement based on
expert elicitation for Dr. Ruderman’s submission of a CDA-2 application.
 Dr. Ruderman’s proposed CDA-1 project supports VA’s top clinical priority—Preventing suicide.
Moreover, this proposal is directly aligned with VA’s mandate to prioritize research that can help develop
targeted suicide interventions by finding out why certain Veterans are at risk of suicide. Despite VA’s strong
predictive analytics for stratifying Veterans at risk for suicide, the mechanisms leading to suicide are poorly
understood. This lack of knowledge has impeded the innovation of targeted and effective interventions
available. National suicide research agendas urge investigators to leverage existing data and determine
potential causal targets that could define or develop effective suicide interventions. However, few large-scale
databases exist that would have the capacity to harmonize and link to the right breadth and depth of
information to successfully detect causal targets for a rare (yet, profound) outcome like suicide. Thus, this
CDA-1 proposed research leverages Dr. Amy Byers’ (primary mentor on the CDA-1) CSR&D Merit award
project (CX001119), which uniquely formed a longitudinal cohort of 5 million Veterans aged 50 years and older
including, currently, nearly 12,000 suicide deaths and data on demographics, inpatient, outpatient,
medications, labs, and morbidity. The CDA-1 project will expand upon Dr. Byers’ research on late-life suicide
risk looking at prognostic factors and fill a significant gap in the field, causal inference, complementing
predictive analytics in suicide risk research at VA. Furthermore, focusing on mid-to-late-life Veterans is ideal
because it supplies targeted information in this understudied and highly vulnerable group, who have the
highest number of lives lost to suicide (~70% of all Veteran suicide deaths), as well as make up over 70% of
the Veteran population.
 Discovering candidates from large secondary data requires an approach that can extract causal
information efficiently while also prioritizing likelihood of clinical utility. Data-driven causal methods have the
potential to do this, but only if such methods are tightly linked with existing clinical and other scientific
knowledge. Therefore, we propose an approach where we: first (Aim 1) utilize causal discovery techniques to
identify preliminary causal candidates for suicide in Veterans aged 50 years and older; and, then, second (Aim
2) develop a protocol to elicit clinical expertise on potential mechanisms of suicide, which will provide
necessary pilot information for a CDA-2 application. Such a biphasic approach ensures expert knowledge is
integrated with computational analysis to maximize likelihood of clinical utility for suicide prevention. To this
end, the aims and training of this 2-year CDA-1 will prepare Dr. Michael Ruderman to submit a CDA-2
application—clearing a path toward an independent research program as a computational psychiatrist, bridging
methods to institute actionable change, reducing suicide risk for Veterans, and empowering their providers."

Adolescent binge drinking promotes enduring cognitive deficits and higher incidence of alcohol use disorder in
adulthood. Studies using a rat model of adolescent binge drinking (EtOH) demonstrate long-term deficits in
hippocampal neuronal structure, function, and behavior; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well
understood. Coincident with changes in CA1 hippocampal neuronal circuit function, adolescent EtOH exposure
results in astrocyte reactivity and chronic dysregulation of astrocyte-secreted signaling factors known to be
involved in synaptic remodeling. Astrocytes tightly regulate synaptic activity and ion homeostasis through their
perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAPs), allowing for bi-directional communication through various contact-
mediated and secreted signaling factors that modulate synaptic transmission. In addition, the behavioral
relevance of astrocyte/synaptic communication is beginning to emerge through exciting new advances showing
astrocytes to be involved in behavioral resiliency, fear learning, and remote memory, and contribute to working
memory deficits following drug exposure. Current data demonstrates that EtOH-induced persistence of
immature dendritic spines (i.e. sites of excitatory synaptic input) is spatiotemporally linked with PAP-synaptic
decoupling. Based on preliminary data the researchers predict that disruption of PAP proximity to synapses
compromises neuron-to-astrocyte signaling and the ability of astrocytes to regulate synaptic homeostasis.
Therefore, the overall objective of this application is to elucidate how EtOH-induced disruption of PAP-synaptic
coupling and neuron-astrocyte crosstalk contributes to long-term changes in synaptic function. Achieving this
objective will allow the researchers to reach their long-term goal, which is to identify the cellular and molecular
mechanisms that may inform novel treatments for the prevention and reversal of synaptic dysfunction and the
emergence of AUD after repeated adolescent EtOH exposure. The central hypothesis is that repeated
adolescent EtOH exposure triggers PAP-synaptic decoupling and lasting changes in astrocyte-neuronal
crosstalk. The rationale behind the project is that understanding the novel mediators that drive EtOH-induced
maladaptive astrocyte-neuronal crosstalk will contribute key insight into the mechanisms underlying synaptic
dysfunction following adolescent EtOH exposure. The proposed research is significant since successful
completion will result in the identification of non-neuronal processes critical for the prevention and reversal of
neuronal circuit dysfunction following adolescent ethanol exposure. An interdisciplinary team of investigators
and consultants with expertise in the field of adolescent alcohol, astrocytes, and electrophysiology will conduct
this innovative project."
10808067,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a destructive inflammatory lung disease that is the 4th leading
cause of death in the U.S., killing more than 150,000 people yearly. Current therapies can improve symptoms
and reduce hospitalization, but none modify this disease or stop its relentless progression. COPD is commonly
caused by cigarette smoke (CS), but we do not yet fully understand the early events that trigger inflammation
and tissue destruction that could be intervened upon to halt the cycle of lung injury. This knowledge gap has led
to an absence of disease-modifying therapies and a therapeutic pipeline that has thus far led to only incremental
advances on existing drugs. The lymphatic vessels are uniquely positioned to regulate inflammatory responses
in most tissues because they drain fluid and traffic immune cells in the form of lymph. We have recently published
our findings that impaired lymphatic drainage alone is sufficient to induce lung inflammation that culminates in
the hallmarks of human COPD. Furthermore, we have discovered that lymphatic endothelial cell injury and
lymphatic vessel thrombosis are early events after CS exposure. Interestingly, we not only identified lung
lymphatic thrombosis in human lung tissue from patients with COPD, we also found that the degree of lymphatic
thrombosis is linked to COPD severity. This work suggests that lymphatic dysfunction may be central to COPD
pathogenesis but the role of the lymphatics in CS-induced lung injury and inflammation is not well understood.
Filling this critical knowledge gap promises to result in new classes of lymphatic-targeted agents that have the
potential to block or reverse COPD and lead to prolonged survival in these patients. We will investigate the novel
concept that lymphatic dysfunction is a defining early event in the pathogenesis of emphysema that can
contribute to progressive tissue destruction. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to define the
actionable mechanisms that result in lymphatic endotheliopathy after CS exposure and drive
progression of COPD. Our central hypothesis is that lymphatic thrombosis due to CS drives disease
progression through activation of thrombin in the lymphatic endothelium. Our approach consists of lymphatic-
specific manipulation of the coagulation pathway and thrombin signaling in order to mechanistically address the
consequences of lymphatic thrombosis on disease progression in a murine model of COPD (Aim 1), and the
mechanism by which CS causes lymphatic dysfunction (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will use these models to test
how inhibition of thrombin activity or specific inhibition of the thrombin receptor affects the inflammatory response
to CS and disease progression. When completed, these studies will lead to a shift in the current paradigm for
the pathogenesis of COPD to include early changes in lung lymphatic function. In doing so, we will both broaden
the field and set the stage for further studies with immediate clinical relevance given the use of existing therapies
to target lymphatic function."

This competing renewal builds on the success of the first 4 yrs. of the ""Microbiology and Immunology Training
for HIV and HIV-Related Research in Uganda” (MITHU) training program. MITHU addresses capacity building
in basic/translational biomedical research on HIV and HIV-related complications in Uganda. Persistence of the
HIV epidemic, compounded by the evolving SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and other emerging
infections, emphasizes the importance of lab-based research capacity in immunology and molecular
microbiology for tracking, prevention, diagnosis and treatment. This capacity requires biomedical faculty at
Makerere University (MU) and other institutions in Uganda to train the next generation of biomedical
technicians, researchers and faculty. For this competing renewal, MITHU proposes the 5 New Aims. Aim 1. To
continue MITHU's success in supporting biomedical MSc training at MU. We propose to continue MSc training
as a primary Aim for this next funding cycle. The best MSc students will go on to biomedical PhD training. Aim
2. To expand Biomedical PhD Training at MU by starting a Sandwich PhD program in biomedical sciences with
CWRU. We propose a Sandwich PhD where outstanding MSc students will be co-mentored by faculty from MU
and CWRU, spend their first yr at CWRU for selected course work in immunology or molecular microbiology, to
do lab rotations, and to select CWRU and MU mentors for their thesis project. Thesis research will begin at
CWRU and will be completed at MU. This Sandwich PhD program is possible because there are now 9
biomedical research faculty in MU's School of Biomedical Sciences. Six of 9 were trained at CWRU, 2 trained
at MU by the Uganda-CWRU Research Collaboration and 1 at Univ. of Wash. Aim 3. To continue mentoring of
junior biomedical science faculty and providing re-entry support for returning PhD trainees as they establish
themselves as biomedical faculty and researchers in Uganda. MITHU will continue to coordinate a mentoring
program for junior and senior research scientists with the College of Health Sciences' NURTURE program.
MITHU will also continue to provide re-entry support for PhD trainees returning to Uganda. Improved internet
access has greatly improved distance-learning and intercontinental interactions, allowing for remote mentoring,
lab meetings and journal clubs. Aim 4. To continue to sponsor the yearly short intensive course “Host-
Pathogen interactions in HIV, TB and their complications. This popular course is attended by MU biomedical
MSc, MMed and PhD students. This course is a mixture of lectures, journal clubs and workshops in which MU-
and CWRU-sponsored scientists present the latest biomedical results and methods related to HIV and its
complications. Aim 5. To continue to leverage for MITHU the Uganda-CWRU Research Collaboration's
expertise and infrastructure for HIV and TB research for training in the biomedical sciences of HIV and its
complications."
10784599,"Prevalence of long COVID is surging among Veterans, and Veterans afflicted with this disease typically incur
progressive declines in function, diminished quality of life and increased disability. Skeletal muscle
pathophysiology has been implicated as a significant determinant of long COVID pathophysiology and clinical
declines. Dr. Forman is a cardiologist and geriatrician who is currently engaged in research studying benefits of
nitrite supplementation with investigational new drug (IND) nitrite capsule supplements in older adults with
sedentariness and/or heart failure. In that work, he is focusing primarily on the utility of nitrites to increase
skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. Secondarily, he is exploring if mitochondrial respiration changes
correlate to changes in physical function. In particular, he is studying if increased serum and skeletal muscle
nitrite elevations correlate to improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., peak oxygen utilization [VO2]), and
to decreased fatigability (i.e., rating of perceived exertion [RPE] during steady-state submaximal [1.5 miles per
hour] walking). In this SPiRE application, Dr. Forman proposes to redirect his expertise in nitrite therapeutics to
Veterans with long COVID. Nitrites will be administered as nitrate-rich beetroot juice versus nitrate-poor
placebo. When beetroot juice is ingested, nitrates are metabolized to nitrite. Compared to IND nitrite capsules,
beetroot juice is relatively easier to administer, less expensive, and hemodynamically safer. Whereas serum
nitrite levels have not been consistently high in studies of beetroot juice interventions as compared to nitrite
capsules, this proposal aims to optimize nitrite levels using 210 ml per day of Beet-It nitrate beverage (James
White Drinks Ltd., Ipswich, UK) to provide 16 mmol of nitrate/day for 14 days versus a 210 ml of nitrate-
depleted placebo. All participants will also undergo physical therapy. Endpoints in this SPiRE study are
oriented principally to physical function. Endpoints (measured pre- and post- the 2-week intervention) include
fatigability as well as walking efficiency (VO2/kg) during steady-state walking. Furthermore, traditional
functional indices of peak VO2, VO2 at anaerobic threshold, 6-minute walk distance, short physical
performance battery, and pulmonary function tests will also be assessed. Nitrite levels (both serologically and
in the skeletal muscle itself) will be measured to best ascertain the relationship of nitrite and putative clinical
changes. In addition, analyses of skeletal muscle will clarify if nitrite-mediated changes in physical function
correlate to changes in skeletal muscle respiration. Overall, this proposal aligns with the Veteran’s Affairs
Office of Research and Development’s commitment to research that helps Veterans affected by COVID-19,
and it also aligns with the Rehabilitation Research and Development’s mission to maximize Veterans’
functional independence, quality of life and participation in their lives and community. Dr. Forman anticipates
applying the data and momentum from this compelling SPiRE-based analysis to pursue a subsequent MERIT
trial that reinforces the value of nitrite therapeutics more definitively for long COVID patients."

The expansion of effective interventions for HIV infection necessitates translation of these interventions to
practice. Without careful scale-up, evidence-based interventions (EBIs) may not achieve their promise.
Implementation science is the study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings into
routine practice. This D43 proposal is designed to expand HIV-related implementation science (IS) in Vietnam,
a country that has been the focus of many NIH-funded intervention studies but has little IS capacity.
The training program, referred to as Vietnam Implementation Science Advancement (VISA), uses a depth and
diffusion model to achieve the following long-term goals: 1) to expand the capacity of Vietnamese researchers
to conduct IS research and 2) to ensure that researchers, policymakers, and program leaders understand IS
principles. These long-term goals will be achieved by addressing the following aims: 1) Initiate the Hanoi Medical
University Implementation Science Program (HMU-ISP); 2) Develop IS knowledge and research capacity among
four health science universities in Vietnam; 3) Develop IS capacity among Vietnamese policymakers and health
program leaders to foster translation of HIV research into practice. We will build depth by establishing the HMU-
ISP, which will serve as the home for in-person training in Aims 2 and 3. By completion of this D43, the HMU-
ISP will have 9 faculty members, including the director (Dr. Giang, co-I), two VISA Senior Faculty who will receive
3-month immersion training in implementation science at UNC; two VISA PhD Fellows who will obtain their PhD
in implementation science at UNC; and four VISA Faculty Trainees who will participate in our training program
(Aim 2). To diffuse IS knowledge throughout Vietnam, we will train 12 VISA Faculty Trainees from four
Vietnamese universities (including HMU) and 12 VISA Policy/Program Trainees, who will be selected from HIV-
focused governmental and non-governmental agencies. The curriculum for the VISA Faculty and Policy/Program
Trainees will focus on HIV-related IS knowledge and skills and research training. VISA Faculty Trainees will also
develop an IS-focused course to expand implementation science training in their home institutions. VISA Faculty
and Policy/Program Trainees will gain IS knowledge through in-person and virtual short courses and a series of
webinars led by leaders in implementation science. Research training will include courses in grant writing and
manuscript writing focusing on an HIV-related IS pilot project, which will be completed in the second year of
training. The pilot projects will be led by an interdisciplinary team including one VISA Faculty and one VISA
Policy/Program Trainee and will be supervised by a team of exceptional faculty, from both the United States and
Vietnam. This innovative D43 brings together a strong team to expand HIV-related implementation science in
Vietnam. By engaging both academia and public health policymakers in IS training, the potential for future
translation of EBIs into practice will be maximized."

Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are more likely to develop metabolic abnormalities, such as
diabetes, however little is known about the basis of this connection. Multiple studies have now shown that
changes to the composition of the microbiota are a factor in multiple diseases, including IBD and diabetes.
Moreover, the studies that have examined the composition of the microbiota within individuals with IBD or
diabetes, have identified similar changes to these resident communities. We have recently identified a mouse
model that develops worsened colitis and spontaneous obesity and insulin resistance. Both of these diseases
are reliant on the microbiota and can be rescued by a microbiota transplant, or an oral gavage of a purified
population of Clostridia. Thus, we hypothesize that the growing incidence of IBD and diabetes may be
attributable to similar defects in the microbiota and might explain the why some individuals are more prone to
develop both diseases. Based on this, we propose a series of experiments to identify a defined consortia of
Clostridia that will function to prevent disease and explore the common mechanisms, including effects of the
immune system, between IBD and metabolism that might lead to the development of these diseases. Thus, our
findings will be among the first to identify a consortia of bacteria that could be used for therapeutic
intervention/prevention of IBD and/or diabetes and allow for an in-depth mechanistic understanding of how
these protective bacteria maintain intestinal homeostasis."

 Ovarian senescence begins about age 30 and over the next 10 to 15 years is manifest by infertility and
a diminished ovarian reserve reflected in decreased Anti-Mullerian hormone levels, decreased expression of the
biologically active hypo-glycosylated follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and elevated serum levels of the less
active fully glycosylated FSH. The process of ovarian aging may lead to modifications within the transcriptome
of ovarian cells that reduce the chances of an older woman having her own biological children. The investigators
of this P01 have established that hypo-glycosylated FSH has greater bioactivity when examined in
physiologically relevant models in vitro and in vivo. It is established that FSH activates a variety of cell signaling
pathways, but how FSH glycoforms regulate the granulosa cell transcriptome is not understood. Missing from
previous studies is an understanding of the role that crucial transcription factors like CREB and YAP1 play in
relaying the actions of FSH glycoforms to control granulosa cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and
senescence. Our central hypothesis is that FSH18/21 and FSH24 differentially regulate the key transcription
factors CREB and YAP1 to modulate granulosa cell function. We hypothesize that aging promotes an inherent
dysregulation of key transcriptional events that regulate follicular development. This project makes use of aging
mouse models and in vitro models using granulosa cells recovered from young and older reproductive age
women and mice. This project will determine the effect of FSH glycoforms on transcriptional programs of
granulosa cells of young and advanced reproductive age mice and women. We will employ genetic loss and gain
of function of CREB and YAP1 and conduct RNA-seq for an in-depth gene expression analysis on their role in
the response to FSH glycoforms. We will use a state-of-the-art approach (CUT&RUN) to identify differential
binding patterns of CREB and YAP1 in granulosa cells from young and advanced reproductive aged women.
We will also perform ATAC-seq on these same samples to profile chromatin accessibility between young and
older individuals. RNA-seq will be performed to capture the entire transcriptome and bioinformatics will assemble
the individual omics approaches allowing a comprehensive understanding of the impact of aging on the response
to FSH glycoforms. We will conduct an integrative bioinformatics analysis to build a comprehensive
understanding of the genomic landscape and target genes and cellular pathways regulated by FSH glycoforms
as a function of age. Successful completion of these aims will reveal unique ovarian transcriptomic signatures
induced by FSH glycoforms as a function of age using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches.
Employment of mouse and human aging models coupled with transcriptomics and bioinformatics analysis will
reveal new knowledge that informs approaches to improve ovarian function and translate to approaches that
improve not only reproductive health, but overall health and longevity."

glycosylated FSH (FSH18/21) and an increase in fully glycosylated FSH (FSH24) observed with aging. These
modifications in FSH glycosylation have significant functional impact, with FSH18/21 displaying faster binding
and more potent signal activation than FSH24. However, it remains unknown how aging and folliculogenesis-
dependent changes in the cellular microenvironment impacts FSH glycoform-dependent FSHR modulation,
which will be addressed by this project. Two important mechanisms that modulate G protein-coupled receptor
function is the formation of GPCR dimers and oligomers, and receptor trafficking. Our recently published
studies suggest that FSH glycoforms differentially modulate FSHR oligomerization, with impact on cAMP
signaling. Moreover, our pilot data suggests that FSH glycoforms may differentially control FSHR
endocytosis. The overarching aim of this project is therefore to understand how FSH glycoforms regulate
FSHR oligomerization and trafficking in primary granulosa cells, during folliculogenesis and aging. The
working hypothesis is that FSH glycoform-specific modulation of FSHR oligomerization results in distinct
trafficking and signaling signatures, with defined functional consequences. The Specific Aims are: 1.
Assessing FSH glycoform-specific regulation of FSHR complexes in granulosa cells of young and
reproductively advanced mice. Our working hypothesis is that FSH glycoform modulation of FSHR
homomers and signal output will be differentially regulated by aging and stage of follicle development. We
will utilize an N terminal tagged FLAG-FSHR knock in mouse to test this hypothesis. 2. Determining the role
of endosomal FSHR in directing FSH glycoform-dependent functional selectivity. Our working
hypothesis is that FSH glycoform-dependent FSHR internalization directs functional selectivity in signal
output and adapter protein binding. We will utilize primary granulosa cells and multicolor fluorescent confocal
and TIRF microscopy to determine the spatial-temporal nature of FSH glycoform and aging modulated FSHR
trafficking. 3. Understanding how FSH glycoforms modulate FSHR interactions with modulatory and
adapter proteins. Our working hypothesis is that FSH glycoforms drive functional selectivity through
differential recruitment of signaling machinery and modulatory proteins. A FSHR pulldown strategy and LC-
MS/MS will determine the FSH glycoform-dependent FSHR interactome. The function of FSHR- interacting
proteins will be assessed by siRNA/over-expression, and age-dependent modulation determined. The project
outcomes will elucidate how age-dependent regulation of FSH glycoforms modulates FSHR functions, to
highlight novel modulatory strategies for therapeutic advances to improve women’s health and wellbeing."
10848248,"Project Summary/Abstract – Project 4(Bousfield)
Our long-term goal is to understand how carbohydrate modulates the biological activity of follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH). The human ovary becomes resistant to FSH stimulation with age and circulating FSH
concentrations rise, keeping serum estrogen concentrations normal until 2 years before the final menstrual cycle.
Around the same time pituitary FSH changes from predominantly hypo-glycosylated hFSH21 and hFSH18 (due
to loss of FSHβ subunit N-glycan at Asn24 or Asn7, respectively) to a predominantly fully-glycosylated hFSH24,
which possesses all 4 N-glycans. Hypo-glycosylated hFSH18 and hFSH21 exhibit greater apparent affinity for
the FSHR, can occupy more FSHR sites, and associate with FSHR more quickly than fully-glycosylated hFSH24.
Our collaborators have demonstrated hFSH18 and hFSH21 exhibit greater biological activity in vitro, rescue
fertility in transgenic Fshb-null mice, and exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression in granulosa cells. The
overall hypothesis of this proposal is that in the face of a senescing ovary the additional switch from hypo-
glycosylated FSH18 and FSH21 to fully-glycosylated FSH24 further compromises fertility and contributes to bone
loss. The objective of this proposal is to study the mechanisms for these differences in FSHR binding via the
following specific aims: 1: Develop FSH glycoform immunoassays with multi-species antibodies. Our
working hypothesis is that fully- and partially glycosylated FSH glycoforms secretion patterns diverge in women.
The fact that hFSH18 and hFSH21 induce unique gene expression profiles makes it imperative to develop
specific immunoassays for all three physiologically relevant glycoforms, hFSH18, hFSH21, and hFSH24. 2:
Determine FSHR/FSH-glycoform structures. Our working hypothesis is that FSH18, FSH21, and FSH24
induce different FSHR conformations that result in biased signals. The Project will purify FSHR and FSH/FSHR
complexes. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Zhao Wang at
Baylor College of Medicine. Highly purified FSH glycoforms, hFSH18, hFSH21, and hFSH24 are available for
both aims. Glycoform-specific assays are expected to provide novel information regarding FSH glycoform
changes during the normal human menstrual cycle and as women age. FSH glycoform/FSHR structures are
expected to reveal the role of FSH N-glycans in fully activating the FSHR.
The potential translational outcomes of this project are unique immunoassays for measuring FSH glycoforms
and knowledge of FSHR function to facilitate development of drugs to enhance or inhibit FSHR function."
10862823,"Developmental neuroscience and psychopathology have great potential to inform the understanding of the
causal pathways and mechanisms of mental illness. This T32, which is focused on this domain, is co-led by
Drs. Luby and Barch (with complimentary expertise in developmental psychopathology and neuroscience), and
has been very successful in the first two cycles of funding, enjoying a highly competitive national applicant pool
and successfully launching the young scientists completing the program into research careers and external
funding. We seek to renew this training grant, adding new expertise in a wider range of neuroimaging
measures, as well as new faculty mentors with expertise in the effects of genetics, the gut microbiome, and
sleep/circadian rhythms on neurodevelopment and risk for psychopathology. From a public health perspective,
an infusion of new research scientists in the area of developmental neuroscience and psychopathology
continues to be a high priority. The proposed multi-disciplinary training approach is guided by a conceptual
model that recognizes that the risk, onset, and course of psychiatric disorders arises through a complex
interplay of brain developmental processes influenced by environmental, psychosocial, cognitive, affective,
genetic, and biological factors that interact beginning in utero and continue throughout development.
Numerous investigators at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) have a rich track record of experience
in many aspects of child neuroimaging and related methods, including a focus on structural and functional
magnetic resonance approaches in very early childhood (including neonates), functional near-infrared
spectroscopy (fNIRS), evoked response potentials (ERP) and high density diffuse optical tomography (HD-
DOT). Further, WUSTL has an international reputation in psychiatric genetics, gut microbiome work, and
sleep/circadian rhythms, with many researchers who can bring their expertise to bear on understanding the
neurobiology of developmental psychopathology. The program mentors have a rich body of available
databases derived from longitudinal studies, several of which began in early childhood and in utero. Mentors
also provide a unique multidisciplinary training environment in which to pursue this exciting domain focused on
development, given the established collaborations between child researchers in the WUSTL School of
Medicine clinical and basic departments, and the state of the program in neuroscience and neuroimaging at
WUSTL that has been at the forefront of developmental cognitive and affective neuroscience. Interactions
between researchers in basic and clinical developmental neuroscience offer an ongoing opportunity to help
train the next generation of young scientists who can pursue questions about the developmental etiology of
psychopathology from the perspective of core psychological and neural mechanisms of human behavior that
span traditional boundaries of psychopathology, an approach central to the NIMH Research Domain Criteria
Initiative (RDOC)."
10844335,"ABSTRACT
Direct trauma exposure is associated with negative physical and mental health consequences, including an
increased risk of rapid decline of cognitive function, which may start early in midlife. Moreover, additional life
traumas such as COVID-19, as well as chronic illnesses, have also been shown to accelerate cognitive aging.
During the World Trade Center terror attack and its aftermath, tens of thousands of traditional first responders
and other cleanup and recovery workers were exposed to the emotional trauma and to environmental
toxicants, and they had high rates of subsequent physical and psychiatric disorders. The time to detect
cognitive decline is before the onset of more obvious symptoms, so that the underlying neurodegeneration
may be delayed or lessened. To evaluate the risk of cognitive decline, we will use remote web-based
neuropsychological tasks to assess core cognitive functioning among the youngest first responders (N=1,200)
in two waves, 40 months apart. The different levels of trauma exposure, and consequent physical and mental
outcomes, which have been well documented, may imply different levels of premature cognitive decline risk
among the responders which will be considered in our experimental design and analytical models. We plan to
recruit first responders who received health services through the WTC Health Program, a majority of whom
were police and non-traditional rescue, recovery and cleanup workers, and compare the risk of cognitive
decline between these groups. In addition, a sub-group of responders and additional community controls
(N=120) will participate in a neurocognitive study using EEG and MRI to elucidate the neurobiological
mechanisms associate with premature cognitive decline. Specifically, we will include core cognitive tasks
(attention and episodic memory) to determine the neuronal underpinnings of early cognitive changes and will
obtain measures of brain morphology and connectivity. This study will generate scientifically robust information
to guide clinical and public health actions focused on premature cognitive decline among the youngest
responders. A better understanding of premature cognitive decline and of the most important pathways
causing such decline has the potential to improve interventions that can reduce premature cognitive decline in
this and other cohorts."
10873036,"The body's largest collection of immune cells underlies the single layer epithelium lining the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract and monitors the luminal contents, which includes trillions of microbes, their products, and substances from
the diet. The basal tone of the healthy gut immune system is tolerogenic, despite being exposed to trillions of
microbes and their products. While this strong tolerogenic capacity is beneficial to the host to avoid inflammatory
responses to innocuous dietary and commensal antigens in the healthy state, the inability to dampen this
tolerogenic capacity could be detrimental in the setting of enteric infection and inappropriately dampening this
tolerogenic capacity could underlie the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammatory diseases. We propose that the
gut has a capacity to turn off tolerogenic responses and generate inflammatory responses. While great progress
has been made in elucidating the role of specific immune cell subsets, cytokines, and other factors promoting
tolerance or immunity, how the gut immune system switches from tolerogenic responses in the steady-state to
protective immunity when needed remains a significant gap in our understanding. Completion of the studies
outlined in this proposal will fill this void in our understanding by identifying how inhibiting a major pathway
delivering luminal substances activates cellular and humoral immune responses at the mucosa.
 In prior cycles of this award we have identified how goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs) are
formed, the stimulus inducing GAPs in the steady-state, acetylcholine (ACh), the stimuli and receptors regulating
GAP formation, including the luminal microbiota, cytokines, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
ligands, and the properties of GAPs in various regions of the GI tract. Further we have identified roles for GAPs,
when physiologically present, in supporting tolerance to luminal substances including dietary and commensal
microbial antigens. Moreover, we have now assembled genetic and pharmacologic models for the manipulation
of GAPs and are poised to dissect the role of GAP inhibition in promoting protective/inflammatory immunity in
the absence of enteric infection or overt changes in the gut microbiota. Based upon our prior studies and
preliminary observations we hypothesize that when GAPs form in the steady state, they act to imprint the
immune system to promote tolerance and when small intestine (SI) GAPs are inhibited they participate in a
cascade of events promoting protective immunity. To explore this hypothesis we propose to (Aim 1) define the
LP-APCs phenotypes, the origins of Th17 and TFH cells that expand, and the durability of the response that
occurs when SI GAPs are inhibited, (Aim 2) define the drivers and specificities of the B cell responses arising
when SI GAPs are inhibited and (Aim 3) determine if SI GAP inhibition improves outcomes and is required for
appropriate responses during enteric infection."

necessary to succeed in both routine and advanced imaging modalities from inception to publication. In addition
to offering instrument time, CTI-SR offers routine and advanced services in electron microscopy sample

10843293,"Core C: Biomarker and Biobanking Core—Abstract
The Biomarker and Biobanking Core will provide scientific direction and oversight of biomarker and biobanking
samples for the entire Health, Aging and Dementia in South Africa: A Longitudinal Study (HAALSI)
Program. The Core is led by two Co-PIs who will oversee a group of international experts in the fields of
epidemiology, genomics, bioinformatics, epigenetics, biostatistics, and biomarker analysis. A biomarker is
defined by NIH as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal
biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. We
further divide biomarkers into two broad categories for the purpose of Core C: (1) those that do not require a
biological sample to be collected and/or stored (e.g., imaging, blood pressure); and (2) those that require a
biological sample to be further analyzed, whether at the point of care (e.g., blood glucose) or in a laboratory
(e.g., urine sodium, DNA).This Core will allow us to continue our commitment to longitudinal sample collection
in Agincourt and the coordinated use of biomarkers across all four research projects. The proposed HAALSI
National survey will augment the HAALSI Agincourt community study with biomarker data from a nationally
representative cohort. The growing collection of baseline and new biomarker data related to dementia,
cognitive function, cardiometabolic diseases, HIV, and inflammation will inform many research questions and
provide opportunities for comparative data for analyses. In particular, we are collecting and analyzing novel
biomarkers for dementia and heart failure that have not been measured extensively in African populations.
Neuroimaging and plasma samples for amyloid beta (Aβ), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), neurofilament light chain
(NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) will allow for improved phenotyping and relationships between
risk factors for dementia. Further, novel cardiac biomarkers of echocardiography and plasma levels of NT-pro
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), cardiac troponin I, and Galactin-3 will be measured for longitudinal evaluation
for the first time in an African cohort, allowing for improved phenotyping and risk stratification for
cardiometabolic disease morbidity and mortality."
10843296,"Project 1: Cognitive Function and Dementia—Abstract
The greatest impact of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is likely to be experienced in low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs). Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, is projected to encounter a dramatic
increase in dementia prevalence and there is a growing need for rigorous population-based studies of ADRD in
this region. Health, Aging and Dementia in South Africa: A Longitudinal Study (HAALSI) addresses core
issues in dementia epidemiology in older South Africans. We implement measures harmonized with the global
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) networks to
enable cross-national comparisons of dementia and its risk factors. Project 1 (Cognitive Function and
Dementia) leverages our deeply phenotyped HAALSI Agincourt cohort to identify causal pathways underlying
cognitive trajectories and applies well-validated neuropsychological assessments to a nationally representative
sample. These data will provide the first national estimates of dementia prevalence in South Africa. We do this
through tightly coordinated work across four overlapping cohorts. Our original HAALSI Agincourt cohort
comprised 5059 respondents ≥40 years of age, for whom we collected three waves of data; this renewal will
add two additional waves. HAALSI-HCAP Agincourt (n≈700) is an enriched subcohort that adds detailed
neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and blood biomarkers of ADRD; this renewal adds one additional
wave of HAALSI-HCAP Agincourt (wave 3). We propose to field a new, nationally representative study of 4500
men and women (plus partners) and a HAALSI-HCAP National survey (n≈624). Project 1 has 3 aims. Aim 1
focuses on characterizing the incidence and progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia in
relation to neurodegeneration and ADRD neuropathology in the enriched Agincourt-HCAP cohort. We examine
longitudinal change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of brain aging and incorporate plasma
markers of ADRD (i.e., Ab, p-tau, NfL, GFAP) to assess associations with dementia symptoms. In Aim 2, we
refine and validate the HAALSI Global Cognitive Screen, HAALSI-HCAP, and HAALSI dementia algorithms for
South African nationwide surveys of dementia. We collaborate with Project 4 to conduct a baseline National
HAALSI-HCAP wave to generate national prevalence estimates for dementia and MCI. In Aim 3, we examine
the impact of social factors, including novel indicators of educational quality and social connection on
participants’ cognitive function and change trajectories. We explore informal educational experiences of special
relevance in the context of rapid social changes in South Africa, including self-taught literacy and effects of
children’s educational attainment on cognition in older parents. Optimizing all four cohorts (HAALSI Agincourt,
HAALSI-HCAP Agincourt, HAALSI National, HAALSI-HCAP National) we identify distinct biological and social
conditions that affect late-life cognitive function in South Africa. HAALSI provides rich, well-harmonized data
to better understand modifiable factors in ADRD and inform global prevention strategies."
10843303,"Project 2: Cardiometabolic Disease in HAALSI—Abstract
High-quality data is critical for guiding research and resource allocation in low- and middle-income
countries (LMIC) to ensure a healthy aging population. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) have become a
leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, an effect of rapid epidemiologic, social, and economic
transitions. These transitions have been unusually intense in South Africa. This rise in CMD-related mortality is
catastrophic to families and households, given the critical role older persons play in providing childcare,
supporting schooling, and countering food insecurity as recipients of social grants. Yet reliable data on the rate
of change in CMD and its risk factors in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa remain scarce. In South Africa,
CMD risk is further exacerbated by interactions with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS; 23% prevalence in the HAALSI cohort). Coupled with longer life
expectancy, CMD may also contribute to cognitive impairment and dementia in African populations. Data on
novel CMD risk factors are scarce, and the incidence of acute CMD events (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke,
heart failure exacerbations) is largely unknown in South Africa. It is critical to measure CMD prevalence and
risk factors more precisely in order to assess their relationship to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in aging populations. Project 2 sits within HAALSI which was launched in 2014 as a program project
(P01) emphasizing cognitive and physical function, CMD, HIV, and the social, economic and health system
conditions that produce wide health disparities in South Africa. HAALSI was built upon the strong infrastructure
of the Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in Agincourt, South Africa. We found that from
2014 to 2021, the prevalence of several CMDs in the rose significantly, with CMD now the leading cause of
deathrural South Africa. Here we request a second renewal for five years (2023-2028). The goal of our renewal
is to leverage the data from our prior waves and increase the deep phenotyping of our HAALSI Agincourt
cohort to reveal major pathways linking risk factors to CMDs, and subsequently to MCI and dementia, in under-
resourced South African populations; as well as to develop a baseline of CMD at the national level with an
additional sample of 4500 new men and women (and their partners) over 40 years of age. We have 3 aims in
Project 2. AIM 1: Elucidate the trajectory and scope of CMD and novel CMD risk factors in the HAALSI
cohort in rural Agincourt and nationally. AIM 2: Examine the relationship between vascular risk factors
and cognitive function, MCI, and dementia in an HIV endemic aging population. AIM 3: Evaluate the
potential impact of recent health and social policies implemented to reduce CMD on cognitive decline,
MCI, and dementia. HAALSI enables progress in understanding and reducing CMD burden and related
pathways to MCI and dementia in South and sub-Saharan Africa."
10843310,"Project 3: Impairment and multimorbidity among people aging with HIV and ART in South Africa –
Abstract
 The benefits and side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are fundamentally changing the age
composition and multimorbidities of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in South Africa, which has the largest
number of both PLHIV and people receiving ART globally. Aging PLHIV are likely to suffer from substantial
cognitive impairment and dementia, physical impairment, and multimorbidities. These impairments and
morbidities are likely distinct from those that people without HIV suffer from – because of the long-term effects
of HIV infection; the side effects of long-term ART; and the psychosocial, behavioral, and structural
characteristics of PLHIV. The research in Project 3 of the Health, Aging and Dementia in South Africa: A
Longitudinal Study (HAALSI) proposal will fill a knowledge gap that is critical for health, aging, and social
policy in South Africa: the population-level frequencies, types, and drivers of cognitive impairment and
dementia, physical impairment, and multimorbidity among PLHIV in HIV hyperendemic communities in South
and Southern Africa. To do this, we will build on the previous HAALSI HIV renewal project, and the successful
partnership between the MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt) and
the Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies. First, we will quantify the national prevalence of
cognitive and physical impairment across the HIV care continuum in South Africa using established cognitive
batteries and physical function tests in the HAALSI National survey. We will also quantify the changes in
cognitive and physical impairment across the age course and the HIV care continuum using the longitudinal
the HAALSI Agincourt cohort. Second, we will identify the distinct multimorbidity profiles of people aging with
HIV and ART in South Africa, using clustering analyses of biomarker, anthropometric, and cognitive and
psychological data on a range of diseases and conditions, including HIV, hypertension, diabetes, obesity,
hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, depression, and cognitive impairment and dementia. Third, we
will utilize quasi-experimental methods to establish the long-term effects of HIV and ART as well as the
psychosocial, behavioral, and structural characteristics of older PLHIV on cognitive impairment including
dementia; physical impairment; and chronic multimorbidity in South Africa. Our research will provide the
evidence that is critically needed to design policies and programs that will ensure healthy and dignified aging
among the large and growing population of older adults with HIV in South Africa and the broader Southern
African region."
10843317,"Project 4: HAALSI National—Abstract
We propose to add a nationally representative cohort to the existing Agincourt sample of the Health and
Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Study in South Africa (HAALSI) Program, allowing us to conduct the first
nationally representative study of cognitive function and dementia in South Africa. Our broad array of health
and socio-economic measures will be collected from a national cohort, making ours the first study from a Sub-
Saharan African country to be included in the international family of Health and Retirement Studies (HRS) and
allowing comparative research between HAALSI and HRS sister studies. We will conduct a national
Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP) study to establish a reliable algorithm to give estimates of
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia prevalence. We will measure the prevalence of cognitive
impairment and dementia in South Africa and examine how it relates to socioeconomic status (SES). We will
determine how the cognition-SES gradient varies for different measures of SES and investigate the underlying
reasons for any differences. A goal of our study is to produce and quickly disseminate data for public use by
researchers both in South Africa and internationally. A major advantage of our study will be our ability to
expand the HAALSI Program’s breadth and depth, by combining the results of the national survey with the
more detailed community results from the HAALSI Agincourt cohort and the detailed cognition studies
embedded in that cohort. In Aim 1, we will recruit participants and collect the first wave of data for the HAALSI
National cohort, a nationally representative longitudinal cohort of 4500 people 40 years of age and older (and
their partners), to study healthy aging and cognition in South Africa. The detailed HCAP battery is administered
to a subcohort which allows us to derive predictive algorithms for ascertainment of MCI and dementia in the full
National cohort. In Aim 2, we will estimate the rate of cognitive impairment in our National cohort and
investigate how cognitive ability varies by SES in South Africa. In Aim 3, we will study the generalizability of
estimates of the determinants of cognitive decline, MCI, and dementia from the Agincourt community to the
National level and pilot extending the survey to additional communities in the South African Population
Research Infrastructure Network (SAPRIN). Impact: This project will extend the HAALSI Program to the
national level in South Africa to produce insights that will inform policymaking and the development of
interventions to support healthy aging."

Inequity in addictions and their treatment are growing, ubiquitous threats to health and society. A global
pandemic and large social movements, such as #BlackLivesMatter, have highlighted negative impacts of racism
and discrimination for addictions and centered “structures as the root cause of inequities. Structural racism has
fundamentally shaped responses to substance use in the U.S. Other structural factors, such as policies and
systems like education, housing, criminal justice, and healthcare reinforce inequality and contribute to addictions
disparities and inequities. However, structural factors in addictions, and how to increase equity in addictions care
and outcomes, are grossly understudied. A new generation of addictions health services scholars is
needed to address equity challenges rooted in structures. Consistent with the goals of NIDA’s Racial Equity
Initiative, next generation scholars will need strong training in anti-racism and related research methods and
fields that can alter structures that reinforce inequity (e.g., policy and implementation science) in addition to
training in traditional health services and addictions-specific content and methodology. As the nation’s premier
public university for research—home to a leading doctoral program in health services research, a top-ten medical
school, nationally-recognized programs in implementation science and health policy, and one of only a handful
of anti-racism centers in the nation—the University of Washington (UW) is well positioned to address these
training needs. Thus, UW’s Department of Health Systems and Population and Division of General Internal
Medicine seek NIDA funding to found the Training in Equity and Structural Solutions in Addictions (TESSA)
Program to: 1) recruit 11 pre- and post-doctoral scholars with interest in addictions disparities, 2) deliver a
specialized curriculum fostering a multidisciplinary understanding of addictions and their care, policy,
implementation science, and anti-racism; 3) provide TESSA scholars mentored research opportunities focused
on addictions equity in multidisciplinary research teams, 4) support TESSA scholars in developing research
career training plans to enhance their skills and prepare them for research careers; and 5) evaluate the success
of the program using explicit benchmarks and pre-defined outcomes. We have developed the TESSA program
to train scholars in 17 core competencies addressing anti-racism, policy, and implementation science in addition
to traditional health services and addictions content and methodology. If we continue to train addictions scholars
without such a direct multidisciplinary approach, we are likely to see slow progress and missed opportunities to
improve equity and reduce morbidity, mortality, and suffering associated with addictions. Investment in TESSA
will result in a new generation of diverse, anti-racist and equity-focused addictions research scholars who are
optimally prepared to develop and test novel strategies for prevention, treatment, and recovery, and implement
effective strategies and policies into real-world settings through a lens of equity and anti-racism, advancing
NIDA’s cross-cutting strategic goals and Racial Equity Initiative to reduce stigma and disparities in addictions."

Targeting MYC promoter G-quadruplex for MYC inhibition by Indenoisoquinolines
G-quadruplex (G4) DNA is a globular DNA secondary structure and considered as a new class of molecular
targets for anticancer drugs. MYC, one of the most commonly deregulated genes in human cancers, has a
DNA G4 motif in its promoter that functions as a transcriptional silencer. Compounds that bind to and stabilize
the G-quadruplex formed in the MYC promoter have been shown to significantly lower MYC levels in cancer
cells. Thus, the MYC promoter G-quadruplex (MycG4) represents a novel target for MYC inhibition by small
molecules. However, little is known about how MycG4 is regulated by proteins and development of MycG4-
targeting drugs has been focused solely on G4 DNA. Whereas drug-DNA interactions may be insufficient for
MYC inhibition, the effective mechanism of drug action could involve protein-DNA interactions, which is
analogous to topoisomerase inhibitors. Very recently, we have discovered that indenoisoquinolines, a clinically
tested scaffold with excellent drug-like properties, are strong MycG4 binders and potent MYC inhibitors. We
have also discovered that the DDX5 helicase actively unfolds MycG4 and is critically involved in MYC gene
transcriptional activation. These results provide new and critical insights to effectively downregulate MYC
transcription by targeting MycG4 and its interactions with DDX5. Our central hypothesis is that
indenoisoquinolines effectively suppress MYC transcription by binding to the MYC promoter G-quadruplex and
disrupting DDX5-MycG4 interactions. The overall objective is to determine the molecular mechanism of
effective MYC inhibition by indenoisoquinolines, establish the structure–activity relationships (SAR), and
discover lead indenoisoquinolines for preclinical testing. The long-term research goal is to develop potent
indenoisoquinoline MYC inhibitors as new anticancer drugs. The specific aims are: 1) Structural
characterization of the MycG4-indenoisoquinoline complexes. 2) Establishing a compound library to determine
indenoisoquinolines that bind MycG4 and inhibit MYC. 3) Determining the effect of MycG4-interactive
indenoisoquinolines on DDX5 unfolding of the MYC promoter G4 and how this correlates with MYC
suppression. 4) Designing and synthesizing optimized indenoisoquinolines for MYC suppression using
structure-based rational approach; establishing SAR for MycG4-binding and inhibition of DDX5 unfolding. The
expected outcome of this work is a determination of the SAR of indenoisoquinolines for MycG4-targeting,
demonstration of the effective MYC suppression by inhibiting DDX5-MycG4 interaction, and discovery of lead
compounds for future preclinical testing. The results will have an important positive impact because they lay
the groundwork to develop new indenoisoquinoline anticancer drugs with MYC-targeted activity."

Elucidating the biobehavioral factors that lead to problematic eating, and ultimately increase the risk for weight
gain, is critically needed given the epidemic of obesity in the United States. While the relationship between
stress and problematic eating has been well-established, other factors that impact this association remain poorly
understood. One important variable that appears to impact the stress-eating relationship is the manner in which
one responds to stressful situations. Stress reactivity is commonly assessed by the manner in which cortisol
changes in response to a stressor. For those who tend to be highly reactive to stress, in moments of high stress,
they appear to be more likely to overeat. Evidence suggests that the gut microbiota influences stress reactivity,
and this appears to be an important biological factor that influences the stress-eating relationship. Additionally,
individuals who place a high reward value on food may be more impacted in moments of stress and may
ultimately overeat or make problematic food choices in those instances. In this study, we propose to pair
biological and behavioral assessment to examine the novel Biobehavioral Model of Stress-Related Eating.
Through a combined laboratory and naturalistic approach, we will investigate the extent to which specific taxa
and genes of the gut microbiota, stress reactivity, and the reward value of food moderate the stress-eating
relationship. Through this multi-method approach, we will also use a combination of momentary and daily
assessment to collect real-time data on stress and its association with dietary intake. This study will overcome
limitations of prior research through its use of momentary data collection and novel pairing of biological and
behavioral variables. Elucidating key factors that lead to problematic eating in moments of high stress has the
potential to lead to personalized treatment approaches for weight reduction and the prevention of obesity."

cancer screening, consisting of an annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan, is
currently recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force to the 8 million
smokers who are at high risk of developing lung cancer, and is poised to substantially reduce
lung cancer deaths. Alarmingly, emerging national data demonstrates that only 3% of black
eligible smokers received screening compared to 12% of white smokers in 2017. Prior research
on cancer disparities fails to address issues that are specific to lung cancer (stigma, high
mortality, and fatalism) and LDCT screening (new test, increased radiation exposure) and
greatly limits the generalizability of the findings from these studies to lung cancer screening. In
this project, we plan to assess modifiable health beliefs as well as examine psychological
responses to discrimination, such as stigma and medical mistrust that may influence lung
cancer screening use among minority smokers. We also plan to evaluate the role of implicit bias
among physicians. Given the newness and unique challenges of lung cancer screening, efforts
to accurately identify barriers and engage Black and Hispanics in LDCT screening early in its
adoption are imperative to achieving an early correction to this disparity. The Specific Aims of
the study are to: 1) Assess racial and ethnic differences in beliefs about lung cancer and LDCT
screening and their association with lower rates of agreement to undergo screening and LDCT
completion; 2) Evaluate if racial and ethnic differences in stigma and medical mistrust are
associated with lower rates of agreement to undergo screening and LDCT completion and
underlie screening disparities; and 3) Assess the association of implicit bias with racial and
ethnic disparities in lung cancer screening referral and LDCT completion. To achieve these
aims, we will recruit lung cancer screening-eligible smokers and their primary care providers
from a vast network of primary care practices in New York City. We plan to measure patient’s
beliefs about lung cancer and LDCT screening, stigma, and medical mistrust, as well as
measure physicians’ bias and test associations with lung cancer screening referral and
completion. The results of the study will directly guide the development of targeted strategies to
improve lung cancer screening rates among minorities."
10886491,"Tinnitus is the most prevalent service-connected disability for Veterans. Many Veterans are offered sound-
based (acoustic) therapy for tinnitus that is intended to alter the tinnitus perception and/or reactions to tinnitus
in a clinically beneficial way. Various methods of acoustic therapy are in use and companies are promoting
different products. It remains unknown; however, how certain acoustic parameters may be more effective than
others. Recent research has shown the benefit of one such acoustic therapy, Notched Noise Therapy, that
presents wideband sound with the tinnitus frequency region notched out, theorized to distribute lateral
inhibition into the notched frequency region to suppress neural activity believed to cause the tinnitus percept.
Previous studies have typically involved brief daily exposures, which are not as likely to remodel neural
processes underlying tinnitus as is continuous “immersion” in background sound, which is adopted here. The
proposed study will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of notched noise therapy
(NNT). The long-term goal of our research program is to develop an accessible, evidence-based treatment that
reduces tinnitus loudness and to be able to assess that treatment through a validated method of behavioral
and physiological clinical tools. The overall objective for this CDA-2 research plan, which is the next step
toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to systematically evaluate the utility of functional, psychoacoustic,
and electrophysiologic measures to reveal the overall whole-health impact in Veterans with chronic tinnitus.
The trial will enroll 108 participants, who will be randomized to one of three acoustic therapy methods:
amplification + notched noise, amplification + noise without notch, and amplification-only. The three groups will
be asked to wear ear-level devices (combination instruments that provide both amplification and 1-10 kHz
shapeable noise) as much as possible during waking hours. All participants will undergo acoustic therapy for 8
weeks and will complete outcome measures (i.e., Tinnitus Functional Index, Psychoacoustic loudness and
pitch matches, AEP, and EEG measures) at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks. They will repeat outcome
assessment at 12 weeks to evaluate for maintenance of any effects while not receiving acoustic therapy for 4
weeks. (Participants requiring hearing aids for hearing loss will continue to use their aids during the 4-week no-
treatment period). We hypothesize that NNT suppresses tinnitus perception by distributing lateral inhibition into
the notched frequency region and will therefore, reduce the perception of tinnitus loudness. At the completion
of this CDA-2 program, the expected outcomes include a NNT as a therapy for tinnitus and the contributions
that it may have on tinnitus perception as well as a solid training foundation for a successful VA research
career. These results are expected to have an important positive impact because they will not only provide
insight into the true reactionary and perceptual benefit of an intervention, but a treatment evaluation protocol
will be determined, ultimately providing a foundation for the development of evidence-based acoustic therapies
to treat tinnitus, a critical component and goal of Veteran tinnitus care."

Project Summary
This CoBRE Phase III application seeks support to develop sustainable research facilities to further enhance a
nationally competitive multi-institutional biomedical research center—the Oklahoma Center for Respiratory and
Infectious Diseases (OCRID). Established in 2013 through the Phase I CoBRE grant and sustained in 2018
through the Phase II CoBRE grant, OCRID has become a focal point for expanding respiratory infectious
disease research in Oklahoma. Based at Oklahoma State University (OSU), OCRID investigators come from
major research institutions across the state of Oklahoma, including 9 colleges at OSU and the University of
Oklahoma, as well as an independent research institute, the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation. As the
first CoBRE grants ever received by OSU, the Phase I and Phase II awards have had a transformative effect
on the landscape of respiratory infectious disease research in Oklahoma. OCRID engages in critical research
on respiratory infectious diseases with a focus on influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, respiratory
bacterial and fungal infections, and now COVID-19. The interdisciplinary projects in OCRID cover therapeutics,
vaccines, diagnostics, disease pathogenesis, nutrition, and bioengineering. Building on the success of the
Phase I and Phase II awards, the overall objective of this Phase III CoBRE application is to further sustain a
research center of excellence in the field of respiratory infectious diseases through the continued development
of research facilities in a collaborative environment. Aim 1 will continue to develop research core facilities with
cutting-edge technologies and transform them into sustainable institutional core facilities. We will continue
to provide core expertise and services to CoBRE projects and other investigators, modernize the established
cores, develop state-of-the-art new technologies to meet the needs of the center investigators, and broaden
core services. A strategic plan to complete the transition of these core facilities into self-sustained institutional
research facilities includes cost recovery, institutional support, securing equipment, resource and technology
and collaborative grants, industry partners and philanthropy. Aim 2 will further enhance the research
environment to sustain impactful research via a pilot projects program and interinstitutional collaborations.
We will continue to expand the critical mass of multidisciplinary investigators in the thematic area of respiratory
infectious diseases by nurturing junior investigators and redirecting established investigators into respiratory
infectious disease research via a pilot projects program and hiring new tenure-track faculty members whose
research is within the focus of the Center. We will also continue to provide research and career development
activities and promote interinstitutional collaborations in Oklahoma via a research seminar series, work-in-
progress and journal club meetings, an annual respiratory and infectious disease research symposium and the
development of multi-investigator grant applications."
10843106,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The mission of MARC at UAlbany is to add well-trained scientists from diverse backgrounds to the
biomedical research workforce. We will prepare traditionally underrepresented (UR) undergraduate students
for a successful transition into research-focused graduate programs and, ultimately, biomedical research
careers, through evidence-based didactic, research, and professional skills training. The program leverages
two key strengths of the University at Albany, namely its highly diverse undergraduate student body and its
status as an R1 “very highly research active” university. It synergizes with existing campus initiatives promoting
diversity, equity, and inclusive research excellence. Specific program objectives are to (1) recruit and retain
six well-qualified rising juniors from groups traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research careers each
year, (2) implement evidence-based strategies that synergistically promote and facilitate MARC scholars’
academic preparedness, responsible participation in mentored research, professional skills and identity, and
social and cultural capital, (3) prepare MARC scholars for the successful transition into and completion of
research-focused graduate degree programs, and (4) employ rigorous oversight and assessment strategies to
monitor program performance and outcomes. Evidence-based training activities are grounded in an
established theoretical framework for advancing UR students in biomedical sciences and impart skills
fundamental for success in research-focused graduate training programs. Coursework prepares MARC
scholars to engage in the responsible and rigorous conduct of research and guides them through the process
of applying to graduate programs. Authentic mentored research experiences, closely supervised by culturally
competent faculty with track records of research excellence and external funding, provide the basis for the
independent capstone research project and co-authorship on conference presentations and manuscripts.
MARC at UAlbany integrates existing campus initiatives and resources promoting student success in
academics and research into a structured program tailored to maximally benefit UR trainees. Importantly, we
augment ongoing efforts with program activities specifically designed to enhance trainee self-efficacy, sense of
belonging, and science identity, and to foster the cultural and social capital crucial for the successful retention
of UR students in biomedical research training and careers. Scholars’ and their mentors’ success in achieving
program objectives will be closely monitored via individual development plans, annual assessments, student
exit interviews, and yearly information gathered from program graduates. An internal advisory committee will
provide regular oversight of program implementation. Targeted measurable trainee outcomes include: (1)
90%+ of MARC scholars graduate with a bachelor’s degree with honors within three years of joining the
program, (2) 70%+ enroll in competitive, research-focused biomedical graduate programs, and (3) 80%+ of
those entering graduate programs complete the degree and enter the biomedical research workforce."

 The short lifespan of human somatic cells, including adult stem cells, in ex vivo settings is a significant
hurdle for many clinical and research applications. Therefore, the development of novel approaches that can
facilitate the expansion of adult cells and at the same time restore the young-like characteristics of these cells
without permanent immortalization is of high priority for regenerative medicine. Telomere attrition is one of the
well-characterized mechanisms responsible for the decline in proliferation and function of somatic cells in
culture and can be counteracted by the activity of the enzyme telomerase. Mitochondrial dysfunctions and
epigenetic changes are also among mechanisms responsible for cellular aging, senescence and decline in
functionality. In our preliminary experiments, we developed a patent-pending non-integrating RNA-based
cocktail of factors that upon transfection into human somatic cells increases the length of telomeres to that
observed in pluripotent stem cells, improves the proliferation rate of cells, restores mitochondrial DNA content
and allows for a clonal expansion of individually seeded adult human fibroblasts (FBs). We now propose to use
this rejuvenating RNA cocktail to develop two novel cellular technology platforms. One will improve the
expansion of human primary somatic cells and promote their rejuvenation in a clinically relevant manner
without permanent immortalization, while maintaining the proliferative capacity, functionality and normal
characteristics of these primary cells. The second platform will allow for the efficient clinically relevant genetic
engineering directly in primary somatic cells. In the latter, the use of our rejuvenating RNA cocktail will allow for
the clonal expansion of genetically modified primary somatic cells, while preserving the functionality of these
cells for subsequent transplantation. To develop the cell expansion platform, in Specific Aims 1 and 2, we will
further characterize the effect of our cocktail on three human cell types commonly used in research and clinical
settings: FBs, keratinocytes (KCs) and mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs). We will perform detailed
molecular and functional characterizations of low and high passage human FBs, KCs and MSCs treated with
our cocktail with a focus on the restoration of young-like characteristics of these cells. In Specific Aim 3, we will
employ our rejuvenating cocktail to develop a platform for the generation of genetically modified human
somatic cell lines. Using Cas9-mediated gene targeting, we will generate a panel of primary human FB, KC
and MSC lines with the site-specific knock-in of fluorescence reporters and luciferase. The derived lines will be
tested ex vivo and in vivo to confirm their functionality and safety, providing feasibility data for the development
of novel somatic cell gene therapies for many diseases. If successful, the studies will serve as a proof of
principle for developing rejuvenating strategies and genetic engineering platforms for other somatic cell types
used for transplantation, such as hematopoietic and muscle stem cells."
10840841,"PROJECT SUMMARY
During the past four years, we have made outstanding progress in mutagenizing the mouse germline genome
while keeping immunity under close surveillance. Now four years into the five-year project, we have thoroughly
examined viable hypomorphic mutations in more than half of all protein-encoding genes. We have declared with
high confidence that 1,298 mutations in 638 genes are causative of phenotypes in FACS and/or antibody
response screens. Many of these genes were novel in that their necessity for immune function had been
unknown, and were re-targeted by CRISPR/Cas9 to verify causation. 154 of the 638 candidate genes (24%;
almost all of them novel) were either knocked out or modified with the ENU allele using CRISPR/Cas9 editing,
expanded into pedigrees, and retested for causation of phenotypes detected in screening and automated
mapping. 148 of the 154 genes (96%) were verified as the source of phenotype(s) declared. An additional 156
CRISPR/Cas9 projects are active at this time, some close to completion. Some of our discoveries have been
published; many more are works in progress. However, all results of FACS assays on all mutations, whether
declared causative of phenotype or not, have been de-restricted for public viewing on Mutagenetix, together with
tools that enable search, examination of the original phenotypes and meiotic mapping data, filtering by P-value,
and direction and magnitude of individual phenotypic effects. This will enable other laboratories to pursue
mechanisms of immunological phenotypes alongside us. Knowledge of genes with non-redundant function in
the development and activation of adaptive immune responses is fundamental to immunology and we plan to
pursue screening further. We also plan deeper studies of the mechanism(s) behind phenotypes of particular
interest. Of the phenotypes named for study in our earlier proposal, we have come to understand those caused
by mutations in Trp53bp1, Ampd3, Rnps1, Prkd2, and Snrnp40, and have published papers describing
mechanism. Additional phenotypes (not named in the original proposal) caused by mutations in Rabl3, Gpr89,
Pdia6, Ncstn, Lmbr1l, Stk4, Pacs1, Wdr37, and Mfsd1 have also been elucidated and published or submitted
for publication. We now propose to examine newly verified phenotypes, all the while creating novel phenotypes
for study by ourselves and others. Our work is now guided by a tool (Similarity Heatmap) that measures
relatedness of phenotypes. In flow cytometry screening, a minimum of 34 measurements are made from each
mouse. The results constitute a phenotypic “fingerprint” amenable to tests of statistical similarity. Mutations in
some genes yield results very similar to mutations in other genes, and we can sometimes infer that multiple
genes operate within a single complex of proteins or enzymatic pathway. We have also written software
(Candidate Explorer) to evaluate phenotypes in advance of declaring causation, telling us the likelihood of
validation should we attempt to re-target any gene in question. We restrict our efforts to the most likely novel
candidates, confident that all true causative relationships will ultimately manifest as saturation advances."

Research: Amyloid-beta (Ab) and tau represent the key pathological protein markers of Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD). Compared with Aβ, tau co-localizes more with sites of neurodegeneration and is more closely associated
with cognitive impairment. However, despite its pivotal clinical importance, mechanistic understanding of the role
of tauopathy in AD, including the associated pathophysiological effects leading to cognitive impairment, has been
elusive. Particularly, little is known about its relationship with the cerebrovascular dysfunction which is a critical
component in AD pathogenesis and neurodegeneration. This is especially true in prodromal AD patients.
Leveraging a state-of-the-art multimodal MRI/PET imaging approach, our proposal aims to address this gap and
disentangle the neuronal and vascular effects associated with tauopathy in prodromal AD. We propose to
investigate the regional association between tau deposition (measured using tau-PET) and two complementary
MRI markers of vascular system function: cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR). To
disentangle the vascular from the neuronal effects, we will also measure the regional glucose metabolism using
FDG-PET. We will then repeat the CBF and CVR measurements after 18-24 months to determine the relationship
between tau deposition and the temporal changes in CBF and CVR. The significance of this work is that it will
provide much richer and more specific information about underlying vascular pathology in prodromal AD than is
currently available and may emphasize for further developments of vasoprotective treatments. Our future work
will focus on identifying vascular mechanisms linking tauopathy to cognitive impairment and predicting the
pathological and cognitive trajectories of individual AD patients. Candidate: My long-term goal is to become an
independent investigator focused on neuroimaging research to create knowledge and tools for developing
effective therapies tailored to the individual characteristics of each AD patient. I have a strong technical
background in a wide range of MRI-based neuroimaging methods. Through this award, I will gain complementary
conceptual (pathophysiology and clinical aspects of AD) and technical (PET imaging, statistical modeling) skills,
which will enable me to formulate and test well-informed hypotheses for AD mechanisms. My short-term goals
are to 1) acquire in-depth knowledge about the pathology and biomolecular basis of AD, 2) acquire clinical
perspectives of AD, 3) develop proficiency in PET imaging and PET-based AD biomarkers, and 4) enhance my
skills in statistical longitudinal modeling. Environment: The unparalleled clinical and technical resources
available at the University of Washington Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center provide the ideal environment
for me to attain these goals. My exceptional mentoring team is comprised of senior faculty who are experts in
AD neuroimaging and have successfully mentored multiple trainees through NIH K awards."

Lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia, are the most common cause of infection-related death
worldwide. γδ T cells are highly conserved leukocytes possessing innate-like immune response characteristics.
Enriched in the mucosa, γδ T cells may play an outsized role in regulating pulmonary inflammatory responses
and have been proposed as a basis for novel immunotherapies. However, data concerning the inflammatory
role of pulmonary γδ T cells during pneumonia in humans are limited. Dr. Shelton Wright is a pediatric
intensive care physician-scientist whose goal is to obtain the necessary training to become an
independent translational investigator of pulmonary host defense. He has established a translational
research program that has identified a critical role of γδ T cells in pulmonary melioidosis, a highly lethal cause
of pneumonia. Based on these findings, he has developed a central hypothesis that host resistance to
pulmonary melioidosis is dependent on an IL-17+ γδ T cell inflammatory response.
Dr. Wright's research goal is to determine the mechanisms underlying the host γδ T cell inflammatory response
during severe lung infection. Using pulmonary melioidosis as a model for severe lung infection, Dr. Wright will
test his hypothesis through the following 3 Aims: 1) Determine the role of γδ T cells in lung inflammation during
pulmonary melioidosis in vivo; 2) Identify differential human γδ T cell inflammatory responses to B.
pseudomallei infection in the ex-vivo lung compared to peripheral blood; and 3) Characterize γδ T cell
activation in patients with early pulmonary melioidosis.
The Career Development Plan for this grant proposal will provide Dr. Wright with critical training in pulmonary
immunology, transcriptomics and high containment pathogen research. Dr. Wright has leveraged the
outstanding training infrastructure at the University of Washington and its affiliates to bring together a wide
array of experts in these fields to provide targeted mentorship for this proposal. Dr. Wright's multidisciplinary
team of mentors will greatly complement his proposed research project along with a carefully selected didactic
program. The data generated by his proposal and the skillsets developed from his training program will
significantly facilitate Dr. Wright's goal of developing into an independent translational physician-scientist
investigating the mechanisms of pulmonary host defense during severe lung infection."
10813018,"Protein methylation on arginine and lysine residues represents a type of versatile posttranslational modifications
occurring in all eukaryotic organisms. Protein methyltransferases regulate a plethora of cellular processes
ranged from gene transcription, RNA splicing, translation, metabolic pathways, to signal transduction. Many
protein methyltransferases are found to be overexpressed or mutated in common human diseases such as
cancer, inflammation, diabetes, neurological disorders, and infection. Hence, protein methyltransferases are
highly promising novel molecular targets in drug discovery. However, biological functions of the majority of
protein methyltransferase enzymes in dictating normal physiology and disease pathways are only poorly defined.
Our long-term research goal is to elucidate biological pathways whereby key protein methyltransferases
contribute to the pathogenesis of recalcitrant diseases such as cancer and infection, and meanwhile to discover
new structural chemotypes for protein methyltransferase-targeted therapy. The present research program is
aimed at investigating molecular mechanisms and functions of protein methylation catalyzed by key
methyltransferases. Our effort is coupled with and aided by development and application of innovative chemical
biology methods and tools. Built upon our recent preliminary results, we will implement experiments to elucidate
novel molecular mechanisms and regulation of protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) activities. We will
extend our efforts to investigate the activity, structure and function of untapped protein methyltransferases,
including those in different organisms such as infectious pathogens. Particular efforts will be directed to develop
isoform-selective modulators and probes for important PRMT members and apply them to elucidate PRMT-
regulated cellular pathways and disease processes. Further efforts will be invested to interrogate potential cross-
interactions of protein methylation with lysine acetylation in orchestrating biological regulation. The results of the
proposed research together will yield an in-depth understanding of the regulatory mechanism and biological
significance of protein methylation in the control of normal physiology and disease pathology, and translate
laboratory research leads into therapeutic candidates for the treatment of protein methyltransferase-controlled
ailments."

DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECT PROGRAM 
Project Summary/Abstract 
In this renewal application, the MS INBRE will leverage extensive experience and successes within the unique 
academic and cultural environment of Mississippi to significantly increase the number of competitive 
biomedical investigators at primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and enhance the overall biomedical 
infrastructure in Mississippi. The MS INBRE's scientific themes focus on severe health challenges and 
disparities in Mississippi – namely, cancer, infectious diseases, and obesity. The Developmental Research 
Project Program (DRPP) for the MS INBRE is designed to grow the human capital within biomedical research 
enterprises in MS through supporting investigators at partner PUIs, particularly Minority Serving Institutions 
(MSIs), assisting with recruitment of outstanding junior faculty to PUIs, training students in biomedical 
research, and providing opportunities for professional development. In particular, we will facilitate engagement 
in research at the PUIs via working with leadership to release faculty from teaching, create or renovate 
laboratory space, purchase and maintain equipment, and purchase research supplies. Support through the 
DRPP has led to extramural funding, such as an R15 to Millsaps College, and numerous PUI peer-reviewed 
publications. This program will specifically address these challenges/opportunities through the following three 
specific aims: 1) Fund Project Development Grants (PDGs) and Research Initiation Grants (RIGs) to support 
biomedical research and maximize student participation in research; 2) Provide Recruitment Funds to promote 
the hire of accomplished, research-active junior faculty to PUIs; and 3) Provide venues for building a 
community focused on excellence in research and a professional development opportunities to PUI 
investigators. Our experience during the previous funding period has shown that such an approach will lead to 
increase biomedical research at PUIs, recruitment of more research focused PUI faculty, and provide 
additional direct hands-on research experiences for undergraduate students. These activities will also enhance 
STEM courses with research components which will positively impact students for many years to come."
10847380,"The proposed work focuses on (a) understanding how natural multimetallic clusters operate as
active sites in metalloenzymes, and (b) using synthetic multimetallic clusters for productive
chemical synthesis. Many metalloenzymes feature multimetallic clusters as active sites for
catalyzing multielectron/multiproton transformations of gaseous small molecules, including
cases of environmental significance to human health like atmospheric regulation of carbon
dioxide and nitrous oxide. In many cases, these multimetallic clusters have unusual
compositions and geometries, and so the chemical reactivity patterns have not been mapped
out in laboratory settings. This proposal aims to achieve that for several multimetallic active
sites, including the tetrametallic active site of nitrous oxide reductase and the heterobimetallic
active site of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, using synthetic model studies based on the PI’s
established expertise in this area. Additionally, lessons about how these natural multimetallic
clusters operate will be applied to develop synthetic multimetallic catalysts for C-C and C-X
bond-forming reactions of relevance to pharmaceutical synthesis. The benefits of developing
this catalytic paradigm for synthetic organic chemistry include emergence of reactivity and
selectivity patterns that are complementary to established mononuclear catalyst systems, as
well as the advancement of a bio-inspired tool to design earth-abundant metal catalysts that
improve the sustainability of synthetic technologies in the pharmaceutical industry."

This application seeks to continue a longstanding CTSA-supported career development program to identify,
nurture, and support dedicated and talented health professionals and scientists so that they obtain the knowledge
and skills they need to build successful, impactful careers as clinical/translational investigators and leaders in
translational science. The Einstein-Montefiore program has consistently identified a large number of highly
capable applicants and has appointed, supported, and nurtured outstanding Scholars who have gone on to
achieve great success. Our 53 graduates have published over 1800 scientific publications and obtained over
$90 million in research funding. We have done this through a carefully constructed series of programmatic
educational activities coupled with each Scholar’s research activities, conducted under the watchful eyes of a
Scholar-selected mentoring team (with co-mentors who bridge a translational divide). We are proposing a robust
mentor training initiative for all K12 mentors, emphasizing the unique responsibilities of translational co-
mentoring.
In the current application, we are building upon this successful track record and instituting several new program
initiatives and priorities, including a renewed focus on diversity (with an expansive definition that includes
diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, and professional background). We have committed to professional diversity
through the planned appointment of our first PhD-trained Nurse-Investigator, and racial/ethnic diversity by
prioritizing appointments of Scholars from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine and science. In addition
to these priorities regarding the characteristics of the Scholars, we are also highlighting 2 areas of research focus
while retaining the non-categorical nature of this program: research in the ‘brain sciences,’ and health equity
research. To support all Scholars, we have also created a new position of Associate Director for Student Support,
who will provide a safe space for Scholars to create, monitor, and revise their Individual Development Plans
(IDPs) and to help Scholars successfully navigate any challenges. We have also developed new curricula in
communication skills, leadership development, and entrepreneurship, along with new courses in data science.
The mission of our career development program is aligned with the theme of our companion UM1 application,
“Building Bridges in the Bronx and Beyond,” emphasizing research collaborations among our medical school,
health system, and the communities both institutions serve. With our new leadership team and programmatic
enhancements, we will build upon the successes of the past and prepare our Scholars to make important new
discoveries and advance the discipline of translational science"
10901855,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 South Africa is the centre of the global HIV epidemic and has the largest absolute number of people living
with HIV (~7.9 million) of any country in the world. South Africa also has the world’s highest TB prevalence (852
per 100,000 population aged >15 years), and the greatest incidence of co-morbid TB among those living with
HIV. These high rates of HIV and TB are further compounded by the high burden of common mental disorders
(CMDs), especially when co-morbid with HIV and HIV/TB. Underlying these national-level health trends are
provincial and district health inequalities resulting from the legacy of the racist apartheid regime. The structural
inequities wrought by apartheid continue to influence the distribution and prevalence of social, economic and
behavioural risk factors that impact health outcomes, all of which continue to be observed in national surveys
and health indicators.
 Similar to Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the United States, South Africa’s Historically
Disadvantaged Institutions (HDIs) were established as non-White, segregated institutions during apartheid. Due
to historic injustices, HDIs have not generated the type of academic resources or research infrastructure to
enable them to compete with their affluent counterparts or establish a global footprint within the research
environment.
 To address these historic health and institutional inequities wrought by South Africa’s racist Apartheid regime,
invest in institutions outside of the historically advantaged cities of Durban, Johannesburg or Cape Town, and
create a critical mass of cutting-edge HIV researchers within the HDIs of South Africa’s Eastern Cape Province,
we propose the Khulani Siphile Siphuhle Training Program (KiSS-TP). Specifically, we will offer an intensive,
interdisciplinary, mentored PhD training program to eight carefully selected Masters-level faculty and staff at
University of Fort Hare (UFH), Walter Sisulu University (WSU) and the Desmond Tutu Health Foundation’s (DTHF)
research program in Eastern Cape; UFH and WSU are two of South Africa’s eight designated HDIs. We will also
strengthen PhD training capacity in Eastern Cape through professional development and progression towards
independent research programmes for UFH and WSU faculty and D43 trainees. Our training consortium will include
DTHF, UFH, WSU, University of Cape Town and University of California Global Health Institute. By selecting PhD
trainees who are junior faculty and staff affiliated with Eastern Cape HDIs and research institutions, we ensure an
immediate return-on-investment regarding: 1) an increase in cutting-edge research capacity in Eastern Cape, 2)
support of academic capacity for nascent PhD programs at UFH and WSU, and 3) training of next generation HIV
researchers. Trainees will have the opportunity to practice their developing skills through mentored research in
the Eastern Cape focused on one of four critical areas of need in that region of South Africa: Adolescent health,
HIV care and prevention; Men’s health, HIV care and prevention; HIV and mental health; and HIV and TB."
11144679,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Loss of functional mobility associated with aging is the leading cause of dangerous falls and loss of living
independence. Approximately 60% of community-residing individuals >80 years-old have a gait disorder, and
abnormal gait patterns are associated with a greater than two-fold increased risk of institutionalization and death
in comparison to age-related adults without gait impairments. Through analysis of temporospatial gait
parameters of healthy and pathologic populations, gait function can be measured, quantified, and monitored.
Three-dimensional (3D) force plates and motion capture technologies are the current gold standard for analysis,
but they are limited by their cost, confinement to laboratory settings, and inability to measure large areas. In-the-
field tests of physical performance can be conducted by trained personnel to screen for functional mobility and
gait impairments, but the resulting data can only be used in comparison gait lab assessments. Other technologies
on the market lack data fidelity and require complicated data analysis, which makes them unacceptable to
healthcare providers and patients alike. To solve these problems, Axioforce is developing a noninvasive
wearable technology that provides near-real time automated gait insights. Axioforce's 3D-force sensing shoe
insole, Axiostride, enables artificial intelligence (AI) empowered at-home gait monitoring for aging individuals at-
risk of functional mobility decline. This will be the first product to measure 3D ground reaction forces via a shoe
insole that can fit within any normal shoe, making it suitable for long term daily use. It will empower clinicians as
an easy tool for early detection of gait disorders and declining functional mobility to help prevent further functional
decline, falls, and loss of independence. This transition Fast-Track grant will support the development and testing
of the sensing insole prototype and accompanying software. In Phase I, the prototype's circuitry will be custom
designed to maximize sampling rate and battery life for continuous at-home use, and the most effective
arrangement of the sensors within the insole will be determined and validated against a standard 3D force plate,
as well as development and testing of an automated data collection and cloud uploading process. In Phase II,
an AI algorithm, trained on collected insole data from normal and pathologic gait cycles in aged individuals, will
be used to classify individuals above and below important thresholds in functional mobility tests. Secondly, a
one-month pilot study will be performed to determine capabilities of the AI empowered Axiostride for
unsupervised classification of functional mobility and analyze the product’s acceptability and adoption. Thus,
Axioforce aims to further improve its insole prototype and develop and test the accuracy of the accompanying
AI algorithm."

10843137,"Abstract Protocol Review and Monitoring System
The City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center (COHCCC) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS)
has developed a two-stage review system for the review, oversight and support of cancer research conducted
by its investigators. This review system includes a first stage review by (1) Multidisciplinary Disease and Modality
Teams (DT/MT) for concept review and endorsements; followed by a second stage review by (2) the Protocol
Review and Monitoring Committees (PRMC) which include the Cancer Protocol Review & Monitoring Committee
(CPRMC) and the Biospecimen and Data Review Committee (BDRC). The offices that administratively support
the DT/MT and the PRMC are within the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) and Clinical Research Protections (CRP)
Office, respectively.
During its first and second stage reviews, the PRMS is focused on the scientific merit of protocols, prioritization
and feasibility of trial completions, as well as the oversight of the progress of approved research and termination
of any research that no longer meets those criteria. All proposed cancer clinical research must initially be
endorsed by a multi-disciplinary DT/MT and reviewed and approved by the PRMC and reviewed by the PRMC
for scientific progress on at least an annual basis. The PRMC has the authority to close trials that do not
demonstrate scientific progress and appeals are evaluated by the Committee. The BDRC was launched in April
2021 to support an enterprise-wide, efficient, and centralized scientific, prioritization, and feasibility review
process for research involving only the use of tissue and/or data. The BDRC follows the same review processes
as the CPRMC and first stage review is required.
The PRMS received full approval from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 2017."
10843140,"Abstract Shared Resource 01: Analytical Cytometry (AC-SR)
To advance our understanding of cancer etiology and to develop improved therapeutic approaches, it is critical
for researchers to have the ability to routinely analyze and isolate discrete cell types from complex
heterogeneous populations. The Analytical Cytometry Shared Resource (AC-SR) fulfills this vital function for
COHCCC Members by providing services to define and isolate discrete immune system cells and cancer cells
based on extracellular and intracellular protein expression, to quantify and isolate cells that express fluorescent
markers, and to examine discrete cell growth states.
Specific Aims for AC-SR:
Aim 1. Support flow cytometry experiments for the analysis of cells and small particles.
Aim 2. Maintain instrumentation for cell sorting and perform multiparameter sorting.
Aim 3. Provide training support for researchers to perform independent flow cytometry analysis and
 sorting within the AC-SR.
The AC-SR provides flow cytometry analysis and sorting instrumentation (18 analyzers, seven sorters) to support
the research goals of COHCCC. The AC-SR maintains analysis instruments (7-BD LSRII/Fortessa, Cytek
Aurora, BD-Symphony, 3-ThermoFisher Attune NxT, 2-ACEA Quanteons, 1-ACEA Novocyte, 2-BD C6, and BC
CyAn) that enable varying degrees of parameter detection for all COH sites. A mass cytometer, Fluidigm CyTOF-
Helios, and a small particle analyzer (e.g., exosome and nanoparticle; NanoSight NS300) is also available.
Notably, the Aurora, Symphony, and CyTOF instruments are new since the last funding cycle. These instruments
allow for high parameter experiments, enabling highly detailed analysis and interrogation of cancer cells, cancer
microenvironments, and immunological responses. All analysis instruments can be operated either by
researchers or by SR staff. Six cell sorting instruments (BD Aria sorters) are located across COH sites of which
4 are available for self-operation by the trained end user. COHCCC has recently purchased an additional closed
system cell sorter (Miltenyi Tyto) to assist with sorting of CAR-T cell products and oncolytic viral research needs.
The SR is directed by Dr. Jeremy Stark, a Professor in the Department of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics and
supported by highly qualified staff that maintain and operate the equipment while also providing training to
COHCCC researchers who wish to operate AC-SR instruments independently.

Adolescents and young adults are disproportionately affected by HIV in the USA, accounting for 21% of new
infections, with sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth carrying the greatest burden of disease. Recently,
phase I trials of potential HIV vaccines have opened possibilities for more prevention options available to youth
(in addition to oral and injectable PrEP). However, implementation of biomedical HIV prevention (e.g., PrEP)
among youth is hindered by numerous barriers that will likely affect HIV vaccine uptake, including
misinformation/lack of information, medical mistrust, and stigma. Youth-focused messaging on biomedical HIV
prevention is nearly nonexistent, leaving SGM teens with incomplete knowledge and fostering
misunderstanding and negative perceptions about biomedical HIV prevention methods. In addition, lessons
learned from the rollout of the HPV and COVID-19 vaccines indicate that unclear public health messaging, dis-
or misinformation from media/online sources, and vaccine stigma contributed to lack of trust, delayed uptake,
or outright refusal of vaccines. As HIV vaccines are in development, and PrEP remains underutilized among
SGM adolescents, now is the best time to understand and address biomedical HIV prevention concerns and
misinformation among youth. Therefore, this study proposes to preemptively debunk (i.e., “prebunk”)
misinformation about HIV vaccines, improve attitudes regarding multiple methods of biomedical HIV
prevention, and improve awareness, intentions, and uptake among SGM youth. In Aim 1, using an online
survey, we will gain comprehensive understanding of biomedical-HIV-prevention-related knowledge, social
norms and attitudes, and behavioral intent among a diverse nationwide sample of 700 SGM youth age 13-21.
In Aim 2, we will develop 8 brief youth-centered video vignettes aimed at prebunking vaccine misinformation
and presenting one or more complementary biomedical prevention methods (vaccine, PrEP, condoms). These
video messages will be delivered through narrative storytelling formats that are relevant, compelling, and
persuasive for youth. We will obtain feedback about the video vignettes from SGM youth and adult
stakeholders at multiple timepoints during video production and integrate this feedback into the final cuts. In
Aim 3, we will test the effectiveness of our messages in a randomized controlled trial with 500 SGM youth,
which will compare the video messages against an information-only control (e.g., publicly available information
from CDC on HIV vaccines and other forms of biomedical prevention). Three-month post-test outcomes
include vaccine acceptability and intentions, vaccine beliefs, and proxies for vaccine uptake (e.g., prevention
information seeking, HIV/STI testing, PrEP initiation.) Within this aim, we will also explore barriers and
facilitators to online- and in-person implementation via interviews with staff in community/clinical settings and
experts in entertainment education and streaming media."
10834977,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cocaine addiction is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and high vulnerability to relapse
even after prolonged abstinence. A major focus of the field of addiction research has therefore
been to identify stable, cocaine-induced neuroadaptations occurring in brain reward circuits.
Transcriptional changes are known to persist throughout abstinence, yet the underlying molecular
mechanisms of such persistence remain elusive.
We recently discovered that the transcription factor, Nr4a1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 4)
represses cocaine reward and seeking behavior. Our preliminary data show that Nr4a1 is a
central regulator of cocaine-induced transcription, including target gene expression in late
abstinence. The significance of this study is strengthened by the utility of therapeutic agents that
regulate Nr4a1 and block mouse cocaine self-administration, underscoring the enormous
potential of this basic research program in combating drug addiction.
Given that histone posttranslational modifications (hPTMs) confer long-lasting changes in gene
expression necessary for stable cellular phenotypes, histone modifications acquired during
abstinence may explain how individual genes “remember” prior drug exposure. We have
previously found that Nr4a1 regulates hPTMs at individual target genes at late abstinence. This
proposal aims to define the mechanism(s) of persistent gene expression in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) of male and female mice following volitional cocaine self-administration. We
apply novel methods for cell-type specific quantification of both chromatin and gene expression
in a single sample. We then validate the causal mechanism of Nr4a1 action using epigenetic
editing in vivo. At the conclusion of this study we will have defined the cell-type specific
mechanism by which Nr4a1 regulates stable gene expression across cocaine abstinence. Beyond
this, we will apply machine learning to identify novel regulators of persistent gene expression
relevant to cocaine addiction."

This project will explore primary healthcare providers (PHCPs) knowledge, attitudes, mental disorders
treatment practices (KAP), and implementation landscape for scaling-up mental health evidence-based
transdiagnostic treatment approaches in Ukraine. An estimated third of people in Ukraine have at least one-
lifetime experience of mental disorder. The most common are depression, anxiety, and substance use
disorder, which are frequently comorbid. Ukraine's suicide mortality rate is higher than in the U.S. and most
Eastern European countries. These contribute to one of the worst European region country health profiles, with
high morbidity, mortality, and disability rates. Due to the Soviet legacies and ineffective approaches during
independence, barriers to Ukraine's mental health services include historical and cultural negative
connotations of mental health services, lack of current evidence-based mental health training for healthcare
providers, and siloed care delivery systems. In the context of lagging mental health and successful primary
healthcare reform, PHCPs, given skills and resources, can offer mental health services using evidence-based
approaches simultaneously addressing several common disorders and substantially decrease the mental
health treatment gap. This five years mixed-methods sequential explanatory study within the Practical, Robust
Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) include the following Specific Aims: 1)To examine
knowledge, attitudes, and treatment practices for common mental disorders among PHCPs in Ukraine; 2) To
assess acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, and cost of Common Elements Treatment
Approach (CETA) when implemented by PHCPs; 3) To explore stakeholders' perceptions of implementation
and sustainability infrastructure for primary healthcare-based mental health services provision. First, I will
partner with the National Health Service in Ukraine (NHSU), a national purchasing entity for state medical
guarantees program, to create a sampling frame of PHCPs and distribute the KAP (target N=800) (Aim 1).
Second, in partnership with the Center for Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (CMHPS), I will assess
implementation outcomes among PHCPs trained in CETA (N=50) (Aim 2). Third, based on the findings from
Aim 1 & 2, I will conduct consensus panels with stakeholders (N=40-50) to understand different perspectives,
their interactions and develop implementation strategies for mental health services scale-up within primary
healthcare (Aim 3). This proposal leverages a partnership with the NHSU and builds on previous CETA
research in Ukraine conducted by CMHPS and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHBSPH).
This study will yield critical evidence for increasing access to mental health services in Ukraine, a necessary
component of improving the country's health profile. It will generate evidence for implementation strategies for
scaling-up and sustaining mental health evidence-based approaches within primary healthcare worldwide."
10851723,"PROJECT SUMMARY: This application is a competing renewal for an Institutional Ruth
L. Kirschstein NRSA Training Grant on the ""Genetic Aspects of Alcoholism."" The
objective of this training program is to provide high level predoctoral and postdoctoral
research training on various aspects of the genetics of alcohol use disorder, and
mechanisms underlying high alcohol drinking behavior. The main focus of the research
training is on the genetic, biological and molecular basis of high alcohol-seeking and -
drinking behaviors. Major topics of research include neuronal mechanisms underlying
excessive alcohol-motivated responding; the genetics of alcohol preference in selectively
bred rodent lines; analysis of the extent that genetically-influenced biobehavioral factors
such as disinhibition, impulsivity and tolerance contribute to alcoholism risks in human
populations; neuropsycho-pharmacological and neuroimaging studies on alcohol craving
in humans and rodents; mechanisms and heritable risk factors that drive decision-
making. The rationale for the research training program is that we do not yet fully
understand how heritable factors influence alcohol drinking behavior. This is a very
important topic and the field needs highly trained research investigators proficient in the
newest behavioral neuroscience approaches. In addition, our program offers
translational research training, encompassing both human and animal studies. The
program is designed to give the trainee exposure to and participation in high-powered
research projects in which state-of-the-art methodologies are used. We expect to
support 7 predoctoral trainees (after their first 2 years of graduate study), and 3
postdoctoral trainees (usually with 0-2 years of post-graduate experience). We anticipate
supporting trainees for at least 3 years (some predoctoral trainees may take 1 or 2
additional years). RELEVANCE: There is convincing evidence that alcohol use disorder
runs in families and that family history represents a risk factor for elements that
predispose high alcohol drinking. Identifying the genes and neurobiological systems that
contribute to alcohol use and abuse would greatly contribute toward understanding and
treating alcohol use disorder."

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is the most common (6,000 to 7,000 new cases per year) lymphoma subtype in young
adulthood. Although there has been great progress during the last few decades, the survival rate for patients
diagnosed at an advanced stage or with relapsed/refractory disease remains low. The current understanding of
the biology of the disease has been translated into the development and approval of therapeutic agents that
target HL-specific antigens or immune checkpoint pathways. However, the number of patients in complete
remission has been low, and relapse frequently develops, leading to poor outcomes. Thus, a clearer
understanding of the molecular pathology of HL is necessary to develop new treatment strategies. HL is
characterized by a minority population of malignant Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells in a background
of dense inflammatory cells. HRS cells have lost their B cell phenotype, however, and escaped from BCR-
mediated apoptosis and immune elimination. Therefore, two major questions remain: (a), how do HRS cells
escape the control of the immune system; (b), how do they survive despite the absence of BCR expression? To
address these gaps in knowledge, we applied an unbiased high throughput CRISPR screening, and identified
an essential role for the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) in HL pathogenesis. Our preliminary
studies demonstrated that LUBAC activity promotes HRS cell survival and immune escape, which significantly
overlaps with mutation status of the most recurrent genetically altered gene in HL, A20. Clinically, LUBAC activity
is consistently elevated in most primary HL cases, and this is correlated with low A20 expression. Moreover,
using RNA-seq analysis, we identified a set of LUBAC-regulated genes in HL that overlapped significantly with
signatures reflecting NF-κB and JAK-STAT activities, as well as TH2 cytokines and cell surface
immunosuppressive molecules. Unexpectedly, our BioID proteomic screening reveals a CD30-LUBAC complex
in HL, suggesting the role of LUBAC-A20 axis in the CD30 mediated NF-κB signaling, TH2 cytokine production,
and STAT6 activation. Finally, a highly specific LUBAC small molecular inhibitor shows promising activity against
HL in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Altogether, these findings provide strong support for our hypothesis
that the LUBAC-A20 axis regulates HL pathogenesis, and that targeting LUBAC could be a novel therapeutic
strategy in this disease. In this study, we will: 1) investigate the mechanistic basis by which the LUBAC-A20
axis supports HRS survival and proliferation; 2) evaluate how linear-ubiquitin-dependent signaling regulates the
molecular circuitry that drives tumor immune escape of HL; and 3) exploit the therapeutic potential of targeting
LUBAC to provide novel intervention strategies for both targeted and immune therapies in HL. These studies
promise to reveal critical insights into the molecular circuitry that drives this lymphoid cancer, as well as provide
unique opportunities for the development of novel strategies for both targeted and immune therapies to treat HL."

Disorders of growth plate chondrocyte maturation impact the growth of the skeleton, resulting in a spectrum of
diseases from skeletal dysplasia to extreme short stature. These diverse conditions underscore the importance
of the tightly regulated chondrocyte life cycle to normal epiphysial physiology, yet the genetic pathways
directing chondrocyte maturation are poorly understood. The current proposal leverages an in vitro model of
the growth plate to (1) conduct high-throughput, genome-wide functional knock-out (KO) screening of
chondrocyte maturation, (2) prioritize screening hits with orthologues linked to human skeletal growth through
genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and (3) investigate the mechanisms by which top targets act to
affect chondrocyte maturation, beginning with top screening hit, Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT1 (PIAS1).
As preliminary data for the current proposal, I developed a screening assay in which a lentiviral library of
80,000 unique single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) is transduced into Cas9+ chondrocytes to simultaneously KO
20,000 genes in replicate. This assay can robustly detect genetic determinants of chondrocyte maturation and
has already identified genes highly relevant to skeletal biology, including members of the Indian hedgehog
signaling family. In the present application, I intend to uncover new genetic determinants of chondrocyte
maturation in the growth plate by adapting my preliminary screen to probe KOs leading to both delayed and
early chondrocyte maturity and intersect these results with GWAS data from human limb length. Furthermore, I
will investigate my hypothesis that PIAS1 acts to delay chondrocyte maturation through its regulation of
chondrocyte transcription and protein SUMOylation, while establishing a pipeline for future mechanistic studies
of top screening targets. Functional genomic screening can expedite discovery of new roles for genes
previously unstudied in human growth plate chondrocytes. By identifying new functional genetic mediators of
growth plate maturation, I hope to gain insight into the development of skeletal dysplasia and growth disorders
while establishing targets for the design of future therapeutics."

 The long-term goal of the Fromen lab is to develop personalized immunomodulatory mucosal therapeutics
using particle immune engineering. Mucosal surfaces line the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urogenital tracts
and serve as the first barrier to foreign invasions. These interfaces are home to the mucosal immune system, a
specialized arm of the host immune protection that maintains balance at these critical barriers. Dedicated cells
at the mucosa regulate commensal bacteria and maintain tolerance, while also mounting responses to combat
pathogenic infections. In the past two decades, engineered particle platforms have emerged as a convenient
way to interact with innate immune cells, providing precise chemical cues and pathogen mimicry capable of
instructing immune response. Despite the overwhelming potential to directly regulate mucosal immune function
at these essential interfaces, most advances to date in particle-inspired immune engineering have bypassed the
mucosal interface altogether and instead focused on parenteral routes of administration. There is a critical need
to develop particle immune engineering approaches that are designed specifically for the mucosal environment,
that can overcome the unique multiscale obstacles faced in mucosal drug delivery. Broadly, there are two major
challenges of particle-driven immune engineering at mucosal interfaces that must be addressed to generate
needed translational advances: 1) overcoming the dynamic barrier function of the mucosal immune system and
2) tailoring effective stimulatory cues specifically to mucosal antigen presenting cells (APCs) for desirable
responses. The Fromen lab has focused our short-term goals on generating fundamental advances in these two
challenge areas, specifically using the respiratory tract as a model mucosal system. Major advances to date
have included evaluation of novel nanoparticle platforms within the respiratory tract for lung APC modulation,
discovery of particle-driven regulation over APC lifespan, and creation of full-size respiratory model systems. In
this proposal, we will continue our efforts to engineer personalized immunomodulatory mucosal therapeutics.
We will continue to develop tools at the chemical-biology interface that control cellular-APC interactions and
subsequent cellular and microenvironment response. We will simultaneously advance macroscopic transport
models to bridge the gap between organ-level and mucosal microenvironment motion that will advance multiple
physiological applications. These future efforts are well suited to the research program, given the widely
applicable multiscale experimental framework to address the broad challenges presented by the dynamic
mucosal interfaces of the human body."

Changes in emotion and social behavior are early yet overlooked features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD,
there is progressive accumulation of beta amyloid (Aβ) and tau proteins, a pathological process that leads to
neurodegeneration and functional connectivity alterations in distributed brain networks. Episodic memory
decline is a hallmark feature of typical amnestic AD presentations, but AD can also cause atypical
dysexecutive/amnestic, language (i.e., logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia [lvPPA]), and
visuospatial (i.e., posterior cortical atrophy [PCA]) syndromes. In typical AD, default mode network dysfunction
is accompanied by elevated functional connectivity in the salience network, a system that supports emotion
generation and interoception. Enhanced salience network connectivity in AD is associated with greater
affective symptoms such as anxiety. Our previous studies have found that specific types of emotional empathy,
a rudimentary form of affect-sharing, are elevated in typical AD and relate to default mode network atrophy.
Whether emotion elevations are present in atypical AD syndromes is unknown but are suggested by clinical
and neuroimaging data. There is emerging evidence that gains in emotional empathy are evident even in
preclinical AD, a prodromal phase in which people have signs of AD pathology on biomarker testing but lack
cognitive symptoms. A central hypothesis of this proposal is that early neuropathology and neurodegeneration
in AD-vulnerable networks disinhibits the salience network and elevates emotion functioning across AD
syndromes. A more detailed understanding of emotion in AD will help to improve diagnosis by broadening
current conceptualizations of each syndrome, to identify emotion measures that suggest the presence of early
AD, and to uncover new biomarkers that change as neuropathology affects emotion-relevant brain networks. In
the proposed studies, we will conduct laboratory-based assessments of emotion (i.e., autonomic nervous
system activity, facial behavior, and subjective experience) in 200 people with AD, as indicated by elevated Aβ
(Aβ+) and tau deposition on molecular PET scans (110 amnestic/dysexecutive AD, 45 lvPPA, and 45 PCA),
and 150 older healthy controls with and without AD pathology (75 Aβ+ and 75 Aβ-) with varying levels of tau
pathology. By relating emotion measures to clinical data, structural and functional connectivity, Aβ and tau
burden, and affective symptoms, we will address three key aims. In Aim 1, we will quantify emotion, empathy,
and social behavior in AD syndromes and Aβ+ healthy controls. In Aim 2, we will delineate the structural and
functional neural networks underlying emotion alterations across the AD spectrum. In Aim 3, we will elucidate
associations among Aβ and tau pathology, emotion system functioning, and affective symptoms. By forging
links among measures of emotion, neural network dysfunction, affective symptoms, and Aβ and tau deposition,
the proposed research will help to broaden models of AD's earliest manifestations and to elucidate how
specific neuropathological changes alter emotion systems and relate to affective symptoms."

Big potassium (BK) channels, named after their ""Big K+"" conductance, are atypical potassium channels activated
synergistically by voltage and calcium. Expressed in nearly all organs, BK channels have important roles in the
function of the nervous, gastrointestinal, reproductive, visual, endocrine, urinary, lymphatic, skeletal muscle, and
cardiovascular systems. BK channel activation requires the allosteric binding of calcium to the cytoplasmic C-
terminal of the channel. Therefore, spatial localization at the plasma membrane and proximity to calcium sources
are two critical factors regulating BK channel function. My previous work using super-resolution microscopy has
demonstrated that rather to be homogeneously distributed at the plasma membrane, BK channels organize into
large clusters. In addition, I demonstrated that these BK channel clusters organize into a higher hierarchical
arrangement with voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV), which are their primary calcium source for activation.
Combining electrophysiology and pharmacology, I established that this BK-CaV co-clustering is key for the
activation of BK channels at physiological hyperpolarized voltages. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that mediate
BK channel cluster formation and the co-clustering with specific CaV channels remain mysterious. Research in
my lab now builds on my discoveries and focus on identifying the molecular mechanisms behind BK-BK and BK-
CaV channel clustering and the role of clustering in the fine-tuning of BK function. Leveraging our expertise in
super-resolution microscopy, quantitative fluorometry, ion channel biophysics, and lipid metabolism, we have
identified three research areas that will advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind BK channel
clustering. Research area 1 will focus on the study of the mechanisms mediating the formation and maintenance
of BK-BK clusters – for this, we will systematically evaluate the role of the BK channel C-terminal and the role of
BK β and γ auxiliary subunits. Research Area 2 will focus on the mechanisms mediating BK-CaV channel co-
clustering – for this, we have identified AKAP150 and RIB2 as two strong candidates that interact with both
channels and can underlie the co-clustering. Research Area 3 will focus in a poorly explored topic, the role of
membrane lipid composition in the clustering of BK-CaV channels – I will leverage my expertise in the study of
ion-channel modulation by phosphoinositides and cholesterol to lead the research on how these two signaling
lipids are involved in ion channel clustering. Overall, this research program is designed to provide new insights
into how BK channel clusters are formed and maintained near calcium sources. In the long-term, this proposal
will open new avenues for the study of mechanisms modulating BK channel function in health and disease."

The latent reservoir is the primary barrier to curing HIV, but little is known about the nature of this reservoir or
the molecular mechanisms that regulate it. Increasing evidence suggests that the size and nature of this reservoir
is impacted by drugs of abuse. Cannabinoid (CB) abuse, in particular, is prevalent amongst people with HIV
(PWH), but the impact of CBs on the latent HIV reservoir has not been investigated. CBs are known to have
immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory activities through activation of the CB2 receptor that is widely
expressed in immune cells, including CD4 T cells. Our hypothesis is that CB exposure during HIV infection
alters the size, location and transcriptomic phenotype of the latent HIV reservoir through CB2-dependent
activation of the AP-1 transcription factor in CD4 T cells. Consistent with this hypothesis we have recently
discovered that cannabinoids promote reactivation of HIV from latency in a T cell model. Defining the impact of
CBs on the latent HIV reservoir will be critical to designing appropriate approaches to clear the reservoir from
PWH who use CBs. To achieve this goal we propose to use cutting edge methods from the fields of single cell
multi-omic analysis to characterize the effect of CBs on the latent HIV reservoir, and to test the functional
role of CB-activated pathways in HIV latency. In the R61 phase, we will use a primary cell HIV latency model
to define the impact of CB exposure on the transcriptome and epigenome of latently infected cells. Additionally,
we will use a cutting-edge single cell HIV assay to quantify the size and location of the intact HIV reservoir in a
cohort of CB-using PWH compared to non CB-using PWH. For the R33 phase, we will combine the results from
these studies with a detailed single cell genomic analysis of identify CB-regulated transcripts in the PBMCs and
CD4 T cells from the CB-using PWH cohort. By integrating these datasets we aim to identify CB-regulated
pathways that regulate the size and subcellular location of the HIV reservoir. Overall these results will advance
our understanding of how CBs interact with the latent HIV reservoir at the molecular level."
