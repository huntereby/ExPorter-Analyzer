Despite modern anti-retroviral treatment (ART), cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a risk factor for mortality
in people living with HIV (PLWH). CVD in PLWH is heterogenous and disease profiles differ between high-income
countries and low-to middle-income countries. A considerable burden of subclinical CVD is thought to be present
in persons before the initiation of ART and these abnormalities may be precursors of more advanced disease
if the underlying pathological processes are not halted. The mechanisms underlying the development of CVD
in treatment naïve PLWH remain largely unknown, as does the modifying effect of ART on these abnormalities.
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is a comprehensive, non-invasive cardiovascular
examination tool that is superior to other imaging techniques in diagnosing early cardiovascular abnormalities.
CMR can characterize tissues that allow interrogation of underlying pathological processes with quantitative
myocardial mapping techniques, but its use has been limited in developing countries due to limited expertise.
The development of CMR-expertise and personnel with the capacity to train and certify CMR-operators in
underserviced low- to middle-income countries is required to advance clinical care and research.
A multi-modal research approach offers distinct advantages by utilizing the strengths of various techniques to
conduct high-quality, mechanistic research. We aim to perform a series of prospective, multimodal cardiovascular
research studies with a focus on exploring the underlying mechanisms of CVD to improve our understanding of
HIV-infection’s effect on the heart and characterize the transition of people living with HIV from a state of ART
naivety to ART. We will utilize an established South African research cohort of 85 newly diagnosed PLWH,
and an age- and sex matched HIV-uninfected control group (n=22). In addition, we will include a completed
prospective research arm containing 73 persons from the HIV-infected group that completed 9-months of ART.
We will investigate the inflammatory pathways associated with the previously described heart muscle oedema
and fibrosis in the cohort by measuring and describing an extensive serum cytokine-panel evaluating the
inflammatory cascade at multiple levels, and correlating select cytokines with previously published CMR-
multiparametric myocardial mapping data (a “virtual, quantitative biopsy” of myocardium). Furthermore, we
will prospectively measure carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (a validated marker of cardiovascular risk) and
characterize the cohort’s atrial morphology and function (using CMR and echocardiographic speckle tracking)
before and after the initiation of ART in newly diagnosed PLWH as an early marker of CVD. We will also build
local CMR-expertise and research capacity to lay the foundation for a planned NIH R01 application.
Our proposed study will contribute mechanistic data on the early impact of HIV on the heart, as well as the
influence of ART on these abnormalities. We aim to address key knowledge gaps that will aid the development
of future screening, monitoring, and treatment strategies to improve the health of PLWH locally and globally."

More than 2% of the population – 5.5 million adults – have Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), with the challenges
that stem from it, including theory of mind (ToM) and language impairments, extending across the lifespan. While
ToM difficulties – challenges in computing perspectives of others – are a hallmark of ASD, language impairments,
including in vocabulary, are present in over half the population. As vocabulary size correlates with vocational
independence, mental health, and quality of life, any barrier to vocabulary growth can pose as a significant
inhibitor to an autistic individual’s long-term well-being. Common word learning scenarios that mandate ToM
skills to resolve reference ambiguities are one such likely barrier, both in terms of the initial mapping and long-
term retention, and targeting or circumventing the ToM mechanisms inhibiting this a powerful route for
intervention. However, little is understood about the role that ToM plays in novel word mapping and retention in
autistic individuals, and the relationship between the ToM and memory networks during word learning has not
been characterized in any population. This behavioral and neurological paucity keeps us from identifying a link
between ToM skills and word learning in scenarios that should invoke them; such a link would be evidence that
interventions that focus on alternate vocabulary acquisition routes would address current weaknesses and
strengthening the ToM network would expand access to vocabulary learning scenarios in daily life rather than
only during an intervention itself. Thus, this study will focus on autistic and neurotypical adults with the goal of
accomplishing two aims. Aim 1 is to investigate word learning behavior and underlying neural mechanisms
in adults with autism. Here, functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) will characterize the role of the ToM network
and its connections to the memory network during initial mapping, immediate retrieval, and delayed retention of
novel words via pragmatic inference, which requires ToM and inferential resolution, lexical inference, which
requires inferential resolution but minimal ToM, and direct mapping, which requires minimal ToM or inferential
resolution, in autistic vs neurotypical adults. Aim 2 is to determine the preferred word learning context for
autistic individuals. Here, we will examine accuracy and reaction time during all three of contexts of Aim 1 for
mapping, retrieval, and retention. Finally, we will examine the relationship between the neural underpinnings
and the preferred word learning contexts of Aim 1 & 2. Vocabulary acquisition is the only language skill to
remain malleable across the lifespan; as such, interventions that target the mechanisms that support it provide
opportunities for increased vocabulary expansion in both autistic children and adults, and through this, increased
independence, opportunities, and quality of life. This fellowship take place at Northeastern University in Boston,
a hub of neuroimaging, language, and autism research, with goals of deepening fMRI expertise, learning
community-engaged research practices, and expanding interdisciplinary technical and communication skills."
10979812,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a leading cause of seizure disorders in adults and is associated with high risk
of memory deficits that can negatively impact day-to-day functioning and quality of life. Memory deficits are most
prevalent in those with pharmacoresistant mesial TLE and hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE-HS). However, a large
subset of patients with MTLE-HS paradoxically have intact memory performance, even with histopathological
evidence of marked hippocampal cell loss. Despite the high prevalence of memory impairment in patients with
TLE, very little is known about the underlying pathophysiological etiologies of such memory dysfunction and
there are no predictive biomarkers. Our long-term objectives are to identify peripheral biomarkers and to develop
individualized prognostication models for memory impairment in adults with TLE, which will aid the development
of evidence-based clinical trials to treat or prevent memory impairment in TLE. Previously, we identified genes
and proteins associated with important neurological functions, including processes essential for new memory
formation and implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. These genes and proteins are overexpressed in the
temporal lobe of patients with TLE and impaired memory compared to those with intact memory, despite the same
pathological substrate and disease severity.
In this proposal, we will identify molecular biomarkers for episodic memory dysfunction in TLE by performing
deep molecular profiling of a well-matched and carefully clinically-phenotyped prospective series of patients with
language-dominant MTLE-HS. Guided by our strong preliminary data, we propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1) to identify regional differences in transcript and protein expression in hippocampal and temporal
neocortical tissues between patients with and without episodic memory impairment; Aim 2) to ascertain cell-type-
specific differences in RNA expression in temporal lobe tissues between patients with and without memory
impairment; and Aim 3) to identify peripheral blood biomarkers for episodic memory impairment in TLE through
integrative analyses. The proposed research is innovative because we will broadly and deeply characterize the
brain transcriptome and targeted proteome in TLE, which has not been investigated previously, using resources
and expertise that are unique to the Cleveland Clinic Epilepsy Center, one of the largest surgical epilepsy centers
in the US. The impact of this project includes 1) the elucidation of molecular underpinnings for episodic memory
impairment in pharmacoresistant TLE and 2) the identification of predictive peripheral biomarkers of memory
dysfunction in TLE. These are crucial first steps in the effort to identify measurable markers and mechanisms of memory
impairment in TLE. The ultimate future goal is the development of personalized prognostication models and evidence-
based clinical trials to treat or prevent memory impairment in TLE, in order to improve day-to-day functioning
and quality of life. In addition, our findings will have important implications for other neurological disorders
associated with memory impairment due to predictably overlapping biological mechanisms."
10979814,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus of global concern and serves as model flavivirus. WNV is transmitted to
humans via the bite of an infected mosquito, and infection is accurately modeled in immunocompetent mice.
During acute infection, WNV replicates in short-lived peripheral myeloid cells and can spread to long-lived
parenchymal cells of many tissues unless restricted by the innate immune response. Those who recover from
infection often experience long-term sequelae including persistent inflammation and cognitive decline. WNV can
invade the central nervous system (CNS) and cause death. Both innate and adaptive immunity are essential for
control of WNV and CNS invasion, but how these responses are initiated and programmed following myeloid cell
acute infection are not well understood. Our studies show that the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), RIG-I and MDA5,
play essential roles in recognition of WNV in myeloid cells. Our preliminary studies now indicate that RIG-I and
MDA5 sense and bind to specific pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) motifs within WNV genomic
and replication strand RNA products to trigger the innate immune response in myeloid cells. Using novel RIG-I
and MDA5 conditional knockout mice lacking either factor in myeloid cells, we reveal that the RLRs direct a
myeloid cell response that serves to restrict systemic virus replication; myeloid cell signaling by RLRs directs an
innate immune response that serves to suppress virus spread, induce type I and III interferons, and protect
against CNS invasion. Immunological analyses indicate that RLR signaling in myeloid cells plays an impotent
role to program the adaptive immune response for clearance of infection. Using an infected cell-reporter mouse
model we have identified previously infected WNV-experienced cells including CNS neurons, following virus
clearance. Functional genomics analyses of WNV-infected myeloid cells, and spatial transcriptional profiling of
tissue regions of the WNV-experienced cells, show signatures of innate and adaptive immune programming that
precede long-term inflammatory signatures of WNV sequelae. Thus, WNV PAMP sensing and innate and
adaptive immune actions lead to outcomes of virus control and infection sequelae but the molecular mechanisms
programming these outcomes are not defined. The proposed studies will investigate the hypothesis that RLR-
mediated sensing of WNV within short-lived, replaceable myeloid cells initiates innate immune response that
prevents viral spread and neuroinvasion, which parenchymal cells that survive viral infection can drive long-term
inflammatory sequelae due to unresolved inflammatory signaling that remains after viral clearance. We will
conduct the following Specific Aims: 1: Define the WNV PAMP ligands of RIG-I and MDA5, and determine PAMP-
induced innate immune activation programs; 2: Determine the myeloid cell-specific role of RLRs in innate
immune protection and immune programming against WNV infection. 3: Identify the determinants by which WNV
infection promotes sequelae across tissues. This work will provide important insight into the virus and host
features of immune programming and post-infection sequelae from infection by WNV and other flaviviruses."
10979884,"The overall incidence rate of colorectal cancer (CRC) has declined over the past two decades largely due to
population-based colonoscopic screening for and removal of precursor adenomas. Even though colonoscopy
has been beneficial for cancer interception, it has limitations that have substantial financial and health
consequences. Nearly all colonoscopy patients in the US undergo conscious sedation/anesthesia which is
responsible for ~$15B in health care costs annually. Resection of polyps, many of which do not have neoplastic
potential, is also expensive, raising colonoscopy costs by ~50%. Colonoscopy misses many adenomas, leading
to a high rate of interval cancers, accounting for about 7,000 new CRC cases each year. Key factors leading to
this high miss rate include the forward-viewing endoscope that misses polyps behind colonic folds, subtle
serrated precursor lesions, and disparities in endoscopist proficiency. These issues underlie unmet needs for
improved adenoma screening technologies that 1) enable the entire colon to be visualized, including behind
mucosal folds, 2) are more sensitive and objective for polyp identification, 3) provide real-time polyp diagnosis,
and 4) can detect and treat adenomas by at the point of care without requiring sedation.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a cross-sectional in vivo microscopy imaging technology that with further
development can address many of these adenoma screening needs. Here, we will create and clinically validate
a new OCT system and two distinct OCT probes that are optimized for adenoma screening. The OCT system
will utilize innovative technology to obtain three-dimensional microscopic images of the entire colon in 5 minutes
(Aim 1.3). One of the proposed OCT imaging probes will operate through the accessory port of a colonoscope,
accelerating clinical translation through its compatibility with standard of care colonoscopy (Aim 1.1). This probe
will utilize novel extended depth of focus (EDOF) optics, allowing it to be centered in the colon’s lumen and
capture high-resolution, cross-sectional OCT images that retain 3D topology. We will use this colonoscope-
compatible probe in a clinical study of 200 patients to develop and test an automated machine learning algorithm
for polyp classification in vivo (Aim 2). The second OCT probe, termed a retrograde tethered capsule
endomicroscope (R-TCE), will be designed to screen for adenomas in unsedated patients at the point of care
(Aim 1.2). The R-TCE device will be a tethered EDOF OCT imaging capsule that is inserted into the anus and
advanced to the cecum via a rotating screw-like motion. Once there, the capsule will be centered in the lumen
by a balloon and pulled back through the colon while imaging. After the capsule is developed, we will conduct a
clinical study to establish the R-TCE clinical procedure and then test safety and feasibility of whole-colon R-TCE
imaging in 45 patients (Aim 3). Finally, to enable future treatment of small adenomas identified by R-TCE, an
R-TCE device that ablates diminutive adenomas will be developed/tested in a swine polyposis model (Aim 1.4)."
10994992,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We propose the construction of a three-dimensional (3D) multimodal molecular atlas of colorectal cancer
(CRC) across different ages of onset of the disease. We aim to address the emerging clinical challenge
of rising early-onset CRC cases by exploring molecular differences between early-onset and later-onset
CRCs. We hypothesize that aberrant interactions between the carcinogenic microbes, tumor metabolic
niche, and the tumor microenvironment lead to accelerated transitions of precancerous cell states to
malignant states. Our atlas will focus on spatially mapping transitions from precancerous to cancerous
components within the same tumor, utilizing a ""phylogeographic"" mapping approach to create
individualized and global progression trajectories between tumor subtypes (early onset CRCs, later-onset
microsatellite stable CRCs, later-onset microsatellite unstable CRCs). We employ cutting-edge
technologies, such as customized spatial transcriptomics, co-detection by indexing highly multiplexed
immunofluorescence microscopy, untargeted imaging mass spectrometry, and histological and
autofluorescence imaging, to comprehensively characterize CRC tissue at various molecular levels and
spatial scales. We employ a 3D multimodal strategy by reconstructing volumes from interleaving serial
tissue sections evaluated by different technologies. Paired whole exome sequencing and single-cell
RNA-sequencing data will anchor our spatial analyses to our previous Human Tumor Atlas Network
(HTAN) data. We leverage our previous success in building colorectal atlases within the HTAN and
ensure that data are released for open-access use to the research community. We have a strong team
with expertise in genomic profiling, multi-omic spatial analysis, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence. Our
proposal emphasizes our team's extensive track record in CRC research, with active programs in CRC,
gut epithelial biology, CRC microbiome, epidemiology, and pathology. Our goal is to provide
unprecedented insights into the genetic, transcriptomic, metabolomic, microbial, and architectural
features of CRC in a spatially resolved manner to better understand CRCs across various age groups."
10995060,"PROJECT SUMMARY. This K01 grant proposal will investigate the early vascular injury and end organ
dysfunction in World Trade Center (WTC)-Particulate Matter (WTC-PM) exposed and affected by
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). PM is the main component of WTC dust, and the exposure of WTC-
PM includes effects such as systemic inflammation, vascular dysfunction, and subsequent end-organ damage.
Epidemiologic investigations have documented associations between increased PM, lung, cardiovascular and
kidney diseases such as chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Additionally, metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is often
associated with kidney damage, and we have seen MetSyn in a large population of our Fire Department of New
York (FDNY) study cohort. This leads to the possible risk of end organ damage such as cardio-renal disease in
WTC-PM exposed FDNY first responders. Further, CKD remains one of the leading causes of mortality and are
characterized by a marked and reduction of renal artery flow. This yields tissue ischemia, renal injury and fibrosis.
Hence, there is an urgent need to explore relevant early phenotypic changes and identify related kidney
biomarkers and cardio-renal vascular setting. Further, a greater understanding of the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying cardio-renal injury could lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches.
This proposal will focus on exploring cardio-renal/ vascular injury biomarkers in FDNY cohort serum samples as
well as understanding the role of macrophages and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) in the development
of renal vascular dysfunction (RVD) in WTC-PM–exposed GERD model, and subsequent cardio-renal failure in
this murine model. Earlier studies showed that immune cells in particular macrophages play a critical role in
mediating cardio-renal injury, repair, and fibrosis. Interestingly, our recent preliminary work shows that there is
macrophage hyperplasia in WTC-PM exposed mice with loss of lung function. Fibrosis is the hallmark of
progressive CKD, which leads to an end organ failure. Our earlier studies indicate that activation of inflammatory
cells can mediate fibrosis in both the heart and kidney through TGF-β. Our preliminary findings demonstrate that
with an increased inflammation, and collagen deposition in inter-tubular region in the kidneys. This proposal
consists of 3 aims. Aim 1 will quantify WTC-cardio-renal vascular risk biomarkers from first responders (FDNY).
Aim 2 will further determine cardio-renal vascular injury by quantifying functional/histopathologic and
complementary imaging modalities in a murine WTC-PM exposure model. Aim 3 will further assess whether
WTC-PM induced cardio-renal vascular injury has an influence in a GERD murine model. Results of the proposed
research will help provide insights into WTC-PM induced cardio-renal associated with GERD risk biomarkers in
first responders as well as how macrophage and TGF-β influence RVD in the remodeling of WTC-PM -induced
cardio-renal vascular injury. Since our proposal will investigate the associated between GERD and cardio-renal
injury in WTC-PM exposure, it falls within the scope of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act."
10991649,"ABSTRACT
It is estimated that around 10% of reproductive-age women of European ancestry, and 15% of women of Asian
ancestry are impacted by endometriosis. In endometriosis, glandular epithelium and stroma closely resembling
the cells of the endometrium grow outside of the uterine cavity, evading the typical cell-intrinsic (programmed
cell death) and cell-extrinsic safeguards (such as immune surveillance) that should prevent cells from surviving
at ectopic locations. Endometriosis causes myriad symptoms including infertility, dysmenorrhea (menstrual
cramps), deep dyspareunia (pain with deep penetration during sexual activity), dyschezia and dysuria (painful
bowel movements and voiding), and chronic pelvic pain. Epidemiologic and genetic studies consistently find
associations between endometriosis and inflammatory conditions such as asthma, irritable bowel syndrome
and autoimmune disorders. Inflammation plays a central role in endometriosis, and the overarching hypothesis
of this research is that studying risk loci shared by endometriosis and inflammatory conditions likely have a role
for hormonal modulation, since endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease.
The goal of this proposal is to characterize key immune pathways that interact with hormonal responses in
endometriosis. This will be achieved through large-scale population based genetic comorbidity studies and
single cell systems biology methods to nominate shared risk genes and state-of-the-art single cell and spatial
molecular profiling of follicular and luteal phase endometriosis. Key cell-cell signaling axes will be validated for
their therapeutic potential using heterotypic in vitro and in vivo models of endometriosis. We will primarily focus
on the proinflammatory IL1 pathway as a risk locus for endometriosis coincides with the IL1 gene family
cluster. Based on integration of genome-wide risk data and single cell gene expression analysis of
endometriosis we hypothesize that IL1A and/or IL1B expression by M2 macrophages combined with IL1
receptor expression in hormone-sensitive endometriosis epithelial cells is the pathway underlying risk at this
locus. We will validate this hypothesis with multiomics and spatial profiling, and then dissect the roles of the
key genes and cell populations using our existing state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo models.
This research will validate IL1 signaling as a key therapeutic target for endometriosis-associated inflammation,
and will likely nominate additional candidates. Subsequent research will focus on clinical translation of these
results. Endometriosis represents the ideal system to study hormonal regulation of inflammation, and
pleiotropy, and so we expect that the impact of this study will extend to other inflammatory traits that are more
common in women, and to the post-GWAS field in general."
10992091,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Local anesthesia is a clinical option for the treatment of post-operative pain that may typically persist for 5-7
days and chronic pain phenotype that lasts longer than 12 weeks. Conventional amino-amide and amino-ester
local anesthetics are effective, but the duration of a typical nerve block or infiltrations nerve block is relatively
short (2-3 hours) reflecting clearance of the molecule. Aside from an invasive catheter, an alternative
commercial formulation of bupivacaine in liposomes (Exaprel) is widely used. While an increased duration of
action is achieved over standard bupivacaine, its duration is typically less than 3-5 days. In addition, the
extended duration of bupivacaine exposure increases risk of intrinsic muscle and nerve toxicity, as well as
cardiovascular and neurologic systemic side effects. The goal of our research is to develop a local anesthetic
preparation that can produce a duration of local anesthesia reliably lasting 7-14 days from a single perineural
injection or site infiltration with minimal local or systemic side effects. To pursue this goal, we propose to
employ tetrodotoxin (TTX), a site 1 sodium-channel blocker, for local anesthetic formulations. Compared with
conventional local anesthetics, TTX is around one thousand-fold more potent in nerve block, and it does not
cause myo- or neurotoxicity, seizures, or arrhythmias. The final milestone before TTX clinical use is to address
its systemic bioavailability, which can cause neural blockade and muscular weakness, resulting in
diaphragmatic paralysis, leading to respiratory failure. To use TTX in a safe manner for prolonged duration of
local anesthesia, we developed a two-stage TTX delivery system, which integrates the chemical penetration
enhancer (CPE) (first stage) and controlled release technology (second stage) into one platform. Specifically,
TTX will be covalently conjugated with poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG)
through ester bonds, and the resulting PLGA-PEG-TTX conjugates will be subsequently fabricated into
nanoparticles. We hypothesize that PLGA-PEG-TTX nanoparticles with appropriate hydrophilicity and diameter
can penetrate the peripheral nerve perineurium to achieve the targeted TTX delivery to the nerve and reduce
the systemic uptake of TTX, and that the nanoparticles will reside inside the nerve and act as a drug depot to
continuously release a constant amount of TTX, which is adequate for the nerve block over time, via the
hydrolysis of the ester bonds. The two-stage TTX delivery system allows safe delivery of larger doses of
perineural TTX than the reported dose tolerance limit, minimizing TTX toxicity, and greatly extending duration
of local anesthesia. We will assess sciatic nerve block, wound infiltration anesthesia, and systemic toxicity of
the PLGA-PEG-TTX nanoparticles in both normal rats and rat models of primary pain as compared with
liposomal bupivacaine. The expected outcome of this project is that TTX-based local anesthetics are likely to
be even safer and will provide longer nerve blocks than can be safely achieved with the rapidly cleared
lipophilic anesthetics currently in use."
10996466,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in the X-chromosome gene MECP2 are both
associated with severe syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders, indicating that the developing brain is highly
sensitive to MECP2 dosage. However, partial reduction in MECP2 function is associated with a milder form of
intellectual disability and autism that manifests more strongly in males than females. Similarly, male mice with
modest changes in MECP2 expression levels display social and behavioral defects without other severe
neurological symptoms. This raises the possibility that human mutations that modestly alter MECP2 expression
levels—such as non-coding mutations in MECP2 cis-regulatory regions (CREs)—could cause autism-like
phenotypes in males. The broad objective of this proposal is to improve the functional map of MECP2 CREs
towards determining whether mutations that impact CRE activity contribute to male-biased autism.
 Previous studies identified two distal MECP2 CREs (one enhancer and one repressor), as well as a
CRE proximal to the MECP2 promoter. However, there are two additional regions of open chromatin within or
flanking MECP2 that have not been investigated. I will test these candidate CREs for MECP2 regulatory
activity (Aim 1) by deleting each region in human neurons, then evaluating MECP2 RNA and protein levels. I
will then determine if these neurons display MECP2-related molecular phenotypes by comparing their
transcriptome to the established dysregulated transcriptomic profiles in MECP2 disease neurons. In addition to
expanding the catalog of MECP2 CREs, I will functionally dissect the three known MECP2 CREs to identify key
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) within each CRE (Aim 2). Each CRE is hundreds of nucleotides long,
making it challenging to know which TFBSs are most responsible for CRE activity and where CRE-disrupting
mutations might lie. I will shuffle each predicted TFBS within each CRE and screen them for an impact on CRE
activity using a massively parallel reporter assay, then validate candidate TFBSs using a traditional luciferase
reporter assay. Cumulatively, these two Aims will expand and refine the map of MECP2 CREs. This work will
provide the groundwork for identifying and interpreting variants in these CREs that could alter MECP2
expression and therefore may contribute to male-biased neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.
 This research will be augmented and strengthened by the exceptional training provided by the Sponsor,
Dr. Huda Zoghbi, and the greater academic environment of Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Medical
Center. This proposal offers the chance to develop new technical skills with in vitro neuronal models, molecular
biology techniques, and bioinformatics, as well as the opportunity to hone my scientific reasoning, writing, and
presentation skills. Successfully completing these research and training plans will ideally position me to
transition into a career as an independent scientist."

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) manifests itself differently across men and women, but the genetic and molecular
factors that drive this remain largely elusive. AD is the most common cause of dementia, affecting over 5 million
people in the USA alone, and till today remains essentially untreatable. Because AD has a strong genetic
component, with inheritance estimates between 50-80%, studying the genetics of AD can importantly aid the
discovery of novel drug targets. However, evidence from various lines of research suggests that sex differences
are an integral part of AD. It is therefore crucial to study the genetics of AD in a sex-specific manner, as this will
help the field gain important insights into disease pathophysiology, identify novel sex-specific risk factors relevant
to personalized genetic medicine, and uncover potential new AD drug targets that may benefit both sexes.
 To date, surprisingly few sex-specific variants/genes have been identified, which we hypothesize is because
prior studies were faced with several obstacles such as data limitations and unexplored research avenues. This
project proposes to use big data together with state-of-the-art approaches in order to leverage established sex
differences in AD as a means of elucidating novel AD risk genes. Aim 1 will improve on prior sex-stratified
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by using larger sample sizes and extensively harmonized data. This
includes a cross-cohort phenotype harmonization and powerful models using age information to improve AD risk
associations. In addition, we will, for the first time, explore the role of rare variants on AD in a sex-specific manner.
Aim 2 will use parallel strategies to Aim 1, but will focus on the X chromosome, which has remained largely
unexplored in the field of AD genetics. For both Aims 1 and 2, we will further validate putative associations by
evaluating their sex-specific effects on gene transcript expression and protein levels in brain tissue. Similarly,
associations will be validated in a sex-specific manner using AD-relevant endophenotypes (e.g. tau levels in the
cerebrospinal fluid) from deeply phenotyped cohorts. Aim 3 will follow a different innovative approach to sex-
specific AD gene discovery by identifying sex-specific AD-related protein changes in brain tissue and determining
the genetic variants that drive them. The latter variants will then be validated by relating them to risk for AD.
 The independent phase of this project will focus on the use of multi-omics data to corroborate sex-specific
gene associations with AD risk, as well as proteomics data to discover new AD risk genes. Central to the success
of this proposal, Dr. Belloy will have the support from an established group of experts in genetics, imaging, and
neurology (Dr. Michael Greicius), multi-omics data integration (Dr. Stephen Montgomery), proteomics analyses
(Dr. Nicholas Seyfried), sexual dimorphism (Dr. Marcia Stefanick), and rare variant analyses (Dr. Zihuai He),

Common mental disorders like depression, anxiety and trauma disproportionately affect adolescents and youth
with HIV (AYH), and are associated with antiretroviral treatment (ART) non-adherence and poor viral
suppression. The integration of mental health services in HIV care for AYH is recommended. However, there
are gaps in integrated mental health assessments, care and referral to mental health specialists. Non-specialist
providers form the bulk of providers in HIV clinics. In previous studies, they reported limited competence to
comprehensively assess and manage mental disorders, heavy workloads and few mental health specialists in
the clinics. There is an urgent need for implementation strategies to support consistent assessments, treatment
and an effective interface between the HIV clinic and mental health specialists. Regarding treatment for mental
disorders within the HIV clinic, adaptation and evaluation of the treatments is required considering the unique
HIV care context before implementation work is relevant. In this project, we propose to develop, pilot and cost
implementation strategies for integrating assessments and effective referrals for common mental conditions
among AYH ages 15-24 years. Aim 1 will identify barriers and facilitators for integrated assessments and
successful referral of AYH in need to specialists. We will conduct focus group discussions with providers and
AYH, and in-depth interviews with mental health specialists, HIV program and policy leaders in Kenya. Aim 2
will identify strategies that address barriers to the implementation of assessments for common mental
disorders, and successful referral for those in need to specialists. We will hold two stakeholder workshops with
providers, mental health specialists, program leaders, AYHIV and their caregivers. They will validate barriers
and conduct barrier prioritization using novel methods that allow stakeholder collaboration in assessing barrier
criticality, ubiquity, frequency and equity. Using implementation roadmaps, we will match strategies to
prioritized barriers, specifying the causal chain from implementation strategy to implementation outcomes. Aim
3 will determine whether the strategies identified improve implementation of assessments and successful
referral to specialists for those in need. We will pilot two top-rated implementation strategies in 6 HIV clinics,
and assess their effect on reach of the assessments and successful referral of AYH using an interrupted series
design, fidelity of assessments and acceptability of the strategies. Further, we will conduct a time-driven,
activity-based micro-costing analysis to inform the scale-up of the implementation strategy by the HIV program,
and assess contextual determinants of implementation with providers and AYHIV. This research matches with
Dr. Mugo’s training goals to build competence in advanced implementation science methods, qualitative and
mixed methods, stakeholder engagement methods and economic evaluation, and skills in scientific leadership
in order to transition to an independent research career that advances high quality mental health care for AYH."

 Cholestatic liver diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary biliary cholangitis
(PBC) are autoimmune liver diseases with limited treatment options. Lymphatic vessels, located in the vicinity
of bile ducts, help to reduce inflammation by removing cellular waste materials and inflammatory immune cells
from the liver. Further, lymphatic endothelial cells (ECs) likely have contact with bile acids, as bile acids and
bilirubin have been observed in lymph of animals with cholestasis. The role of the hepatic lymphatic system in
cholestatic liver disease is largely unknown, and so are the effects of bile acids on lymphatic EC functions.
The goal of this proposed study is to explore the potential of increasing lymphatic vessels as a therapeutic
option for cholestatic liver diseases and understand this healing process with a focus on the microenvironment
and the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphangiogenesis (formation of new lymphatic vessels).
 Our preliminary studies showed that lymphatic vessel numbers were significantly increased in mouse
models of cholestatic liver disease. We have also found that promoting lymphangiogenesis through
overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), the most potent lymphangiogenic factor, can
significantly decrease liver fibrosis and injury in mice with cholestasis, suggesting a beneficial role of lymphatic
vessel formation in cholestatic livers. Further, we have determined that liver lymphatic ECs express bile acid
receptors, such as Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5), and significantly proliferate in response to
bile acids such as taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) and taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), known to have a strong
affinity to TGR5. These observations have led us to hypothesize that hepatic lymphatic vessels may exert a
beneficial effect on cholestatic liver injury and that certain hydrophobic bile acids may be novel pro-
lymphangiogenic factors. To test these hypotheses, we propose three Aims: 1) determine the role of the
hepatic lymphatic system in cholestatic liver disease, 2) determine the mechanism of bile acid-driven hepatic
lymphangiogenesis, and 3) determine the spatial and temporal regulation of lymphatic vessels and their impact
on the progression of cholestatic liver disease.
 The proposed study will determine whether hepatic lymphatic vessels work to ameliorate cholestatic
liver disease and whether boosting lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic drainage could be a new therapeutic
option for this disease."

Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disorder in which the patient’s pancreatic islets are
destroyed by their own immune system, leaving them unable to produce insulin to manage their
blood glucose levels. Currently, this disease affects about 1.6 million people in the United States
and roughly 180 new patients are diagnosed each day. Clinical islet transplantation is a potential
solution that involves injecting donor islets into the patient’s liver to secrete insulin and regain
blood glucose control. A challenge of this therapy, however, is decreased islet viability due to
mechanical stress and adverse inflammation at the infusion site. The utilization of islet
encapsulation or islet-loaded porous scaffolds can provide a means to protect islets from these
stresses; however, encapsulation can result in insufficient engraftment and incomplete
immunosuppression, while traditional scaffold fabrication methods generate inconsistent pores
and rough surfaces that can lead to unfavorable and unpredictable host responses to the implant.
To address these challenges, this proposal seeks to develop a multi-functional biomaterial
scaffold that improves the vascularization, engraftment, and immunoprotection of transplanted
pancreatic islets for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes mellitus. In Aim 1, we will alter scaffold
porosity and rung thickness to identify the specific geometric features that will result in robust host
engraftment with minimal fibrosis. For Aim 2, we will incorporate depots of synergistic
immunosuppressants into the 3D-printed scaffold material for controlled local drug delivery. We
will characterize the kinetic release curves of the drug eluting scaffold in vitro and optimize the
drug loading parameters necessary for sufficient local immune protection. Islet-loaded,
therapeutic scaffolds should provide local drug release resulting in the suppression of adverse
immune reactions in an allograft rat transplant model, preventing rejection of the cell cargo.
Broadly, results from this work will provide a better understanding of the roles that scaffold
geometry and local therapeutic release play in cell-based therapies, while improving experimental
outcomes in islet transplantation."

Myocarditis is a leading cause of heart failure and sudden cardiac death, but many cases of myocarditis follow
a benign course. It is unknown what factors control this variable susceptibility to severe disease. Without this
knowledge, the ability to develop targeted therapies to prevent disease progression is greatly limited. Viral
infection is the most common known cause of myocarditis, and much research has focused on the pathways
involved in the heart’s response to viral infection. Many such studies have identified type I interferon signaling
as critical for viral pathogenicity and susceptibility to myocarditis. Quantitative trait locus analysis suggested the
cardiomyocyte-specific protein cardiac troponin i3 kinase (TNNI3K) as a potential candidate. In an initial study, I
infected homozygous Tnni3k knockout and control wild-type mice with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) for 10 days
and demonstrated a direct role of Tnni3k in viral myocarditis. I additionally showed that Tnni3k’s kinase activity
is necessary for mounting an effective response. Preliminary cell-based transfection of Tnni3k with an interferon
signaling response element (ISRE)-linked reporter showed that presence of Tnni3k led to increased ISRE
expression after treatment with interferon-α. Therefore, I hypothesize that TNNI3K decreases susceptibility to
viral myocarditis in a kinase-dependent manner by enhancing the interferon response in
cardiomyocytes. I will address this hypothesis by testing the role of Tnni3k in vivo (Aim 1) and in vitro (Aim 2).
Aim 1 of this proposal expands on the initial study by infecting Tnni3k knockout and control wild-type mice with
CVB3 and assessing measures of myocarditis after 4 days and after 35 days. Additional mouse models modifying
the kinase activity of Tnni3k have been generated and will also be tested with viral infection. One of these models
is of particular interest, as it recapitulates a common SNP found in millions of humans. In Aim 2, I will confirm
the influence of TNNI3K in the interferon pathway by treating wild-type and TNNI3K knockout induced pluripotent
stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) with CVB3 and evaluating gene expression of proteins in the
interferon pathway. I will then probe for differentially phosphorylated proteins in wild-type and TNNI3K knockout
iPSC-CMs following CVB3 infection. Differentially phosphorylated proteins will be silenced in iPSC-CMs to define
their role in the interferon pathway specifically in cardiomyocytes. Results from this study will document a
mechanism by which TNNI3K controls susceptibility to viral myocarditis. This model will enable future studies
aimed at developing novel therapies targeting myocarditis progression at the molecular level. This fellowship
award will support my development as an exceptional cardiologist-scientist."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive brain cancer type that responds poorly to standard treatment and ultimately
develops chemo- and radioresistance. This is due, in large part, to the presence of a sizable and heterogeneous
population of GBM stem-like cells (GSCs) that escape conventional therapies and replenish the tumor mass.
This project addresses the dire need of attacking these resilient GSCs in order to improve GBM therapy. We will
pursue a novel approach focused on targeting cell-scaffolding proteins that are essential for cellular functions.
Because GSCs rely on these scaffolding proteins to maintain signaling mechanisms that are critical to
radioresistance, we expect that our approach will create an inescapable vulnerability to the effects of radiation,
achieving significantly increased tumor lethality. We will focus on a cell-scaffolding protein of the DLG (Disc
Large Homologs) family, which are protein-carriers that are critical to keep signaling mechanisms active in their
correct locations within the cell. We recently discovered that an unusual member of this family, DLG5, is highly
upregulated in GBM and is necessary to maintain the GSC population in the tumor. Our published and
preliminary work shows that DLG5 keeps tumor stemness and radioresistance mechanisms, such as Sonic
Hedgehog (Shh) and Hippo, in a persistently active state. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that DLG5
maintains redundant mechanisms that contribute to tumor stemness and the resistance of GSCs to radiation.
We predict that targeting of DLG5 will create a non-recoverable vulnerability that can be combined with
radiotherapy for improved attack of GBM. To validate this hypothesis, our first Aim is to characterize how the
genetic targeting of DLG5 sensitizes GBM cells to radiotherapy. We will investigate the regulation of
complementary Shh/Hippo signaling by DLG5 in GSCs and will determine if DLG5 deficiency causes a dominant
negative effect that synergizes with radiation to kill these tumor cells. Phenotypic and mechanistic studies will
be pursued in GSC cultures, followed by studies in tumor organoids and in vivo orthotopic GBM models. Our
second Aim is to validate new agents to disrupt DLG5 functions and radioresistance in GBM. We will engineer
cells with DLG5 deletion constructs to identify DLG5 domains that are critical to keep active Shh/Hippo signaling
and to maintain the radioresistant features of GSCs. Next, we will focus on our described interaction of DLG5
with the ubiquitin-ligase cullin-3, which is ""sequestered"" by DLG5 in order to keep stemness pathways in a
persistently active state. We will test novel cell-penetrating peptides designed to disrupt the interaction of these
two proteins, with the expectation that releasing cullin-3 from DLG5 will result in dominant negative effects on
radioresistance. Successful completion of this exploratory project will demonstrate the importance of cell-
scaffolding proteins as high-level targets that can be disrupted to create an inescapable vulnerability in the tumor
stem cell population, increasing the lethality of radiotherapy and other conventional treatments. Targeting
scaffolding proteins can open new avenues to develop medicines with high therapeutic impact against GBM,
improving the survival of patients with this aggressive cancer."
10978027,"In this project, we aim to develop and improve the delivery of various therapies, including adeno-associated
viral (AAV) and nanoparticle (NP) gene therapy to the heart. The impetus for this project is a high unmet need
for cardiomyopathies that do not have current treatments. Cardiomyopathy is an umbrella term for disorders of
cardiac muscles. Collectively, these disorders are highly prevalent, and many lack specific treatment options.
Because most gene therapies are one-time, single-dose treatments, improving heart targeting becomes critical
to achieve adequate efficacy. Systemic delivery of AAV or NP vectors in adult, often overweight, patients is
fraught with challenges related to the low transduction of cardiomyocytes and the life-threatening immune
response. By enhancing the delivery of genetic information to the heart and reducing its sequestration by the
liver, we would be able to increase efficacy and improve safety of these therapeutics. Based on the discoveries
in our lab, we hypothesized that by co-delivering AAV, NPs, oligonucleotides, antibodies or other therapeutics
with an engineered polymeric adjuvant, a synthetic enhancer, will improve the therapeutic index of these
therapeutics. We also hypothesized that this technology that we call heart-redirected targeting (HRT) has a
potential to enhance the delivery of any therapeutic entity. This hypothesis is supported by the preliminary
studies on mechanism of action of HRT and examples of delivery of various therapeutic modalities. Therefore,
in this proposal, we aim to: 1) test the risk/benefit of HRT; 2) investigate the generality and reproducibility of the
HRT; 3) elucidate the mechanism of action of HRT in human-relevant cellular models; 4) test the long-term
efficacy of HRT with AAV carrying frataxin (FXN) transgene in genetic mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia (FA).
In order to decrease mortality in FA, it is critical to treat cardiomyopathy, which is the dominant cause of death
among FA patients. If successful, this work will have an unprecedented impact on drug delivery and gene
therapy, because the HRT system is agnostic to the delivery vehicle, opening a possibility of cardiac targeting
with a wealth of approaches developed to date."
10976945,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to establish a new microphysiological ‘joint-on-chip’ system, with structural
biomimicry and biomechanical function, that can support mechanistic study of arthritic diseases and rapidly test
candidate treatments. Recent advances in the development of on-chip technologies have shown potential to
miniaturize musculoskeletal tissues and emulate key aspects of a healthy joint. One primary goal of on-chip
technologies is to create robust and reliable human models of the joint so that the study of disease pathogenesis
and screening of promising drug treatment candidates is possible with high throughput. No disease modifying
treatments are available to address osteoarthritis (OA), a health burden that afflicts millions of people in the
United States. With the development of on-chip technologies, pharmaceutical companies would be positioned to
‘fail fast’, and advance or accelerate only the most promising candidate drug therapies toward clinical trials.
Unfortunately, realistic joint-on-chip models currently lack minimal essential functionality that is necessary for
the study of arthritic diseases and evaluation of treatment candidates. Challenges include the need for human-
derived biomaterial inks that support tissue-specific mechanical and cellular responses, and the need to
recapitulate the complexity of the human joint, including crosstalk between multiple tissue types, and movement-
induced biomechanical stimuli like frictional sliding that mimics the in vivo environment. To improve realistic joint-
on-chip models, our lab has developed human-derived biomaterial inks – particulated allograft extracellular
matrix with a unique crosslinking technology – to enable 3D bioprinting of tissues that more closely mimic the
natural structure of cartilage, bone, and synovium. We have additionally demonstrated that differential
biomechanical stimuli (e.g., compression and frictional sliding) promote distinct cellular responses that are
characteristic of healthy tissue and needed in the engineering of a miniaturized version of the human joint. We
now plan to develop a joint-on-chip with minimal essential functionality using human-sourced tissues and cells
to study arthritic diseases and drug treatment candidates. We will optimize human biomaterials to recreate
essential tissue structure and function, and engineer necessary biomechanical stimulation that is currently
lacking in on-chip technology. We will pursue three related specific aims. In Aim 1, we will optimize a library of
particulated and human-derived biomaterial inks for 3D joint-on-chip printing. In Aim 2, we will establish a human
joint-on-chip platform with minimal essential functionality. In Aim 3, we will quantify the joint-on-chip pathogenic
response to biomechanical injury and inflammatory challenge. If successful, we will for the first time create a
realistic joint-on-chip model with essential functionality that is useful to study arthritic diseases and evaluate
treatment candidates."

Social isolation (SI) and loneliness are associated with adverse health outcomes and are serious public health
risks throughout life. In early life, SI has well known deleterious effects on socioemotional and cognitive
development, and on the developing brain. SI and loneliness also can increase drug and alcohol usage in
adolescent humans and post-weaning SI increases cocaine and methamphetamine self-administration in rats.
The mechanism by which SI impacts cognition and addictive behavior are mostly unknown, but they may
involve disturbed sleep and neuroinflammation. Disturbed sleep has been suggested to be important in the
adverse effects of SI and loneliness, and sleep disturbances and the risk for SI and loneliness are common in
adolescence. SI and loneliness can increase sleep disturbances and disturbed sleep negatively impacts
cognitive performance. Disturbed sleep also heightens risks for substance use disorders (SUDs). SI can alter
microglia activity, which determines neuroinflammation levels. However, there have been few studies of how
early SI, and degrees of isolation, impact cognition and addictive behavior. There also is minimal information
as to the role disturbed sleep and neuroinflammation play in SI-induced changes in cognition and addictive
behavior in adolescence and potential persistence into adulthood. We will employ a paradigm comparing rats
single-housed in standard transparent cages (SI) and rats single-housed with opaque barriers between cages
to prevent visual contact (ESI, enhanced SI) to pair housed (PH) rats. In adult rats, chronic ESI, a putative
model of loneliness compared to SI alone reduced sleep, reduced EEG delta, produced different levels of
neuroinflammation, and altered astrocyte morphology. There also were significant sex differences in sleep and
behavior. We will use this model in our planning project to develop methods to assess the effects of SI and ESI
during development on neurocognitive function and addictive behavior in rats. We have assembled a
multidisciplinary team with expertise in translational SUD research/addiction, neurocognitive testing, neural
signal processing, sleep neurobiology, neurohistology and circadian rhythms to determine how SI and ESI
impact drug seeking and consummatory behavior, cognition and neurocircuit activity and the role that sleep
may play in altered cognition and addictive behavior. We will develop methods and paradigms to assess, in
adolescent and adult male and female rats, the effects of early life SI and ESI compared to PH on cognitive
performance and drug self-administration. We will also develop methods to record neural activity during
cognitive testing and to assess sleep and neuroimmune function as mediators of SI- and ESI-induced effects.
Our goal is to identify, and develop methods to pursue, promising lines of research that will increase
understanding of the effects of early life SI and loneliness on subsequent cognition and addictive behavior."
10977706,"Persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (AD/ADRD) are vulnerable to heat-illness,
particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods, due to limited resources to combat heat
exposure. High temperature is a risk factor for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and is associated with worse stroke
morbidity and mortality. The problem is that both environmental heat and socioeconomic stressors
independently impact persons with AD/ADRD and also are associated with worse stroke outcomes. Yet, no
extant studies have evaluated the combined impact of environmental heat and socioeconomic stressors (i.e.,
heat vulnerability) on stroke outcomes in persons with AD/ADRD. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate
the role of the heat vulnerability index (HVI) on stroke functional outcomes in persons with AD/ADRD. HVI was
developed by the New York State and City Departments of Health as a combined metric integrating
environmental and socioeconomic factors to identify neighborhoods with higher risk of heat-related deaths. We
hypothesize that persons with AD/ADRD in high-HVI neighborhoods suffer higher rates of AIS, worse stroke
severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale - NIHSS≥6, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score -
ASPECTS<6), and worse outcomes on discharge with higher mortality (modified Rankin scale - mRS6),
dependent disability (mRS3-5), and new-onset oropharyngeal dysphagia. The rationale is based on our
preliminary data, which shows significantly higher AIS rates in high-HVI, compared to low-HVI neighborhoods.
In this proposal, we will establish the AD/ADRD and AIS rates and trends in high- and low-HVI neighborhoods
over the past decade from 2014-2023 (Aim 1); and we will compare AIS rates (Aim 2), stroke severity (Aim 3),
and stroke outcomes (Aim 4) between high- and low-HVI neighborhoods in patients with AD/ADRD. Since HVI
has not been evaluated in prior AD/ADRD studies, we will analyze the most comprehensive and diverse
database from New York State's largest health system, with the following advantages relevant to this proposal:
1) Large sample size of >1,100,000 hospitalized patients, >80,000 patients with AD/ADRD, and >25,000 AIS
events. 2) Broad racial and ethnic diversity for robust evaluation of socioeconomic disparities in the AD/ADRD
and AIS populations. 3) Over 200 unique, relevant clinical variables (that do not exist in state or nationwide
claims data) for patients with AD/ADRD and AIS that will advance studying health inequities in the AD/ADRD
population. Our proposal is highly significant because we aim to uncover the link between environmental heat,
socioeconomic disparities, and stroke outcomes in AD/ADRD that can drive meaningful change in the following
ways: a) Discover a novel stroke risk factor to provide new targets for intervention that will improve functional
outcomes in persons with AD/ADRD. b) Identify specific neighborhoods with health inequities to implement
preventative strategies that will reduce the stroke burden in the AD/ADRD population. c) Impact health policy
with new stroke interventions (e.g., cooling centers) to reduce health inequities in the AD/ADRD population."

The objective of the 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Biomineralization (‘Revealing the Unifying
Principles of Biomineralization through Model Systems’) and the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS;
‘Exploring Mechanisms Behind Mineral Formation in Biological Systems‘), is to bring together early career and
established scientists from around the globe with multidisciplinary backgrounds and diverse expertise in order to
bridge the relevant scientific disciplines that are required for understanding biomineral (e.g., teeth, bone, shells,
pathological minerals, etc.) formation, function, and application. These fields include, but are not limited to,
biology, chemistry, physics, dentistry, medicine, geology, engineering, and environmental sciences. To achieve
this objective, the GRC/GRS meeting will focus on three specific aims: Aim 1: Assemble a cutting edge scientific
program to: (i) identify universal scientific principles and mechanisms that are common to biomineralization
processes in evolutionary diverse organisms, (ii) identify the most advanced in vitro and in vivo model systems,
as well as state-of-the-art analytical technologies to study biomineralization mechanisms across scales, (iii)
explore scientific principles for the purpose of translational research. Aim 2: Create an environment that will
foster fruitful interactions among graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career investigators with
established scientists. The GRS is a key component that will establish a supportive and open community that
will continue throughout the GRC. Aim 3: Empower women, minorities, and persons with disabilities to fully
participate in the high-quality scientific program through both formal (e.g., invited talks, selected poster
presentations, the “Power Hour”) and informal (e.g., shared meals and afternoon activities) opportunities. The
proposed program includes 44% female speakers and 46% female discussion leaders. Speakers and poster
presenters will share a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art topics to cover genetic, biochemical, and cellular
mechanisms of formation, structure, and function of biomineralized tissues. The impact of biomineralization on
health and disease, the translational aspects of biomaterials applications, and interactions of biominerals with
the environment will also be covered. We will highlight new developments studying the main biominerals (Ca-
carbonates, Ca-phosphates, SiO2, Fe3O4), from single-celled prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms to
increasingly complex multicellular invertebrates and finally vertebrate animals and humans. A particular focus
will be on unveiling fundamental biomineralization mechanisms that have been preserved through evolutionary
times and understand how they have been adapted to fulfill a multitude of biological functions in a large variety
of organisms. As a complement to the presentation sessions, the daily poster sessions are central elements of
the GRC and GRS meetings. They will serve to broaden and deepen discussions about emerging topics in the
field. About 10-15 poster contributions will be selected for short oral presentations based on quality and with
priority being given to early career scientists, as well as those from underrepresented groups."

Alzheimer's disease (AD), and other neurodegenerative tauopathies, are defined by their pathologic
accumulation of overexpressed, hyperphosphorylated, and oligomerized tau. Tau tangles result in proteotoxic
stress through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cell death, and ultimately neurodegeneration. Understanding the
molecular mechanisms that lead from tau aggregation to neuron loss is key to identify novel therapeutic targets.
We have elucidated how the BCL-2 family member BOK induces apoptosis in response to ER stress stimuli.
Specifically, we have found that BOK, which is predominantly bound to the inositol-3-phosphate (IP3R) calcium
transporter in the ER, regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR) as well as the transfer of calcium from the
ER to the mitochondria. Critically, BOK plays an important role in the formation of mitochondrial-ER contact sites
(MERCs), also known as mitochondrial ER-associated membranes (MAMs). MAMs are central signaling hubs
for the cell, mediating processes like calcium transfer, the UPR, mitochondrial shape and metabolic homeostasis.
Neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with the abnormal quantity, formation and function of MAMs.
In preliminary work we find that BOK regulates metabolic survival and cell death pathways in neurons. Our goal
is to determine how the control of metabolic pathways through MAMs by BOK regulates neuronal cell death due
to tau. Aim 1 will examine how BOK regulates tau-induced neuronal cell death through its regulation of ER to
mitochondrial calcium transfer. Aim 2 will determine how BOK impacts autophagy through MAMs and its
consequences for tauopathy. Aim 3 will define the ability of BOK to control lipid metabolism in tau-bearing
neurons. Each of these aims focuses on metabolic pathways that signal through MAMs, that are known to be
important for AD, and for which we have preliminary data implicating a role for BOK. This project will benefit from
a multidisciplinary approach that includes neuronal genetic reprogramming, cutting-edge intravital microscopy,
and advanced lipidomics. We will employ 2Phatal, two-photon chemical apoptotic targeted ablation, a novel
technique we developed to induce and measure cell death in live mammalian brains without neighboring injury.
These novel tools will enable us to address our conceptually innovative hypothesis that tauopathy-induced
neuronal cell death is regulated by BOK's control of metabolic pathways that signal through MAMs. Discernment
of the signaling networks that control the balance between metabolic homeostasis and cell death during tau-
induced neurodegeneration is expected to provide targets for therapeutic development."

Thirteen percent of adults over 75 suffer from aortic valve stenosis (AVS), a progressive disease that leads to
aberrant collagen deposition, leaflet stiffening, and eventual valve calcification at late stages. AVS is also
sexually dimorphic with men having a two-fold higher risk for developing direct calcification, whereas women
with equal disease severity tend to have more valvular fibrosis prior to calcification. The molecular mechanisms
underlying sexual dimorphism in AVS progression remain poorly understood, but growing evidence suggests
AVS is an inflammation-dependent disease. Sex is known to influence the magnitude of the immune response
and function, so we propose to investigate the role of inflammation in sex-specific valve disease progression.
We hypothesize that three major variables contribute to differences in valve calcification in male and female
patients: (1) heightened myofibroblast activation in female valve cells when exposed to inflammatory cues, (2)
elevated expression of bone mineralization inhibitors, such as osteopontin, in female valve cells, and (3) sex-
specific differences in epigenetic machinery. To test these hypotheses, we will develop sex-specific in vitro
models of fibro-calcification that are comparable to diseased valve tissue. We will then investigate the sex-
specific role that macrophage and valvular interstitial cell (VIC) crosstalk has on AVS (Aim 1) and determine the
role of epigenetics in sex-specific regulation of calcification regulators (Aim 2). Ultimately, we aim to identify sex-
specific therapies targeted to VIC populations to slow or halt AVS disease progression (Aim 3)."

 Asthma is influenced by multiple factors including genetics, infections, diet, and environmental
exposures, with the immune response and subsequent regulatory mechanisms influencing pathophysiology,
disease progression and severity. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an intracellular sensor for organic
compounds and toxins that regulates cellular homeostasis and physiological responses. Recent studies suggest
an important role for AhR in regulating airway epithelial and immune cell responses to lung inflammation. While
interest in AhR signaling has centered around immune cells and epithelium, how AhR activation influences
airway smooth muscle (ASM) per se, particularly in inflammation/asthma, are not known. In this regard, some
unresolved questions are A) Is ASM AhR signaling important, and if so, what is its expression and function during
inflammation and asthma? B) What roles do ASM AhR play in regulating mechanism that promotes airway
hyperresponsiveness and remodeling? Our novel preliminary studies show: 1) Human ASM expresses AhR,
which is enhanced during asthma; 2) AhR activation represses gene expression, particularly those involved in
proliferation and remodeling pathways; 3) AhR activation inhibits mitogen and/or diesel exhaust particle (DEP)-
induced ASM cell proliferation and migration; 4) AhR activation also reduces TGFβ-mediated ECM production
and deposition; 5) In a mixed allergen (MA)-induced asthma mouse model, smooth muscle specific AhR
knockout mice (AhRfl/fl/smMHCCre/0) show exacerbated hyperresponsiveness and worsening of lung function
compared to WT mice; 6) TCDD (AhR agonist) inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling in MA-
challenged mice; 7) ASM AhR activation in vivo confirmed by increased ASM CYP1B1 expression. Thus, our
overall hypothesis is that activation of ASM AhR signaling inhibits inflammation-induced hyperresponsiveness
and remodeling in asthma. This will be tested via the following Specific Aims. 1) In human ASM, determine the
mechanisms of AhR expression and regulation in inflammation and asthma. 2) In human ASM, determine the
role of AhR signaling in proliferation and remodeling in the context of inflammation and asthma. 3) To determine
the in vivo importance of ASM-specific AhR signaling in airway remodeling in a chronic allergen mouse model of
asthma. Aim 1 explores AhR and ARNT (AhR nuclear translocator) expression and their underlying mechanisms
in the presence/absence of pro-inflammatory cytokines relevant to airway inflammation/asthma, MA, and DEP.
Aim 2 explores the AhR effects on ASM cell proliferation, migration, ECM, and their underlying mechanisms
relevant to airway remodeling. Aim 3 will integrate in vitro results in a clinically-relevant MA adult mouse model
of allergic asthma with/without chronic inhaled AhR agonist. Using AhRfl/fl/smMHCCre/0 mice, studies will assess
airway function, structure (remodeling), and changes in ASM proteins for mechanisms explored in Aims 1 and 2
(laser capture microdissection, RNA-seq; immunofluorescence). Clinical significance lies in establishing a
protective role of AhR in ASM towards novel therapeutic approaches to alleviate remodeling in asthma."
10986564,"ABSTRACT—Cell State Network-Directed Therapy
Drug resistance is a significant challenge in cancer therapy and has historically been addressed from “one step
behind”, whereby drug(s) become progressively ineffective, resistance mechanism(s) are studied, and then
different drug(s) are used. While genetic and other resistance pathways are well-appreciated, so-called cell state
plasticity is increasingly understood to be a major determinant of resistance. Cell state is typically defined by a
transcriptome pattern, and plasticity is mediated largely by dynamic epigenetic transitions that mimic
developmental or tissue homeostasis programs. The different cell states along with the transitions between them
comprise a cell state network. Because different cell states can have unique drug sensitivities and resistances,
and cells can change state dynamically through the network, cell state networks provide flexible resistance
mechanisms. This proposal seeks to design therapies based on cell state network dynamics, such that drug
sensitive states are promoted while limiting transitions to drug-resistant states. However, an agnostic
experimental screening approach for drug combinations is extremely challenging, even considering just two
drugs and the hundreds of FDA-approved anti-cancer compounds, not to mention inter-patient heterogeneity,
doses, and timing/sequence. Computational models that predict how tumor cell populations respond to drug
combinations could help fill this gap, but so far this has been a challenging problem, even for modern machine
learning methods. Our preliminary work shows combining knowledge of cell state transition network dynamics
and single drug dose responses could enable computational prediction of how varied drug combinations
influence cell population growth dynamics, and how a sufficient and attainable set of data enables unique
inference of cell state networks. These motivate our proposal to predict and test “cell state network-directed”
therapies, with particular focus on glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a brain tumor with poor survival and few
treatment options. We propose four Aims to study 3 different patient-derived xenograft models of GBM with in
vivo-like tumor-chip systems: Aim 1. Develop Glioma Cell State Network Models; Aim 2. Determine How
Microenvironmental Factors Alter Cell State Networks; Aim 3. Determine How Glioma Cell State Networks
Respond to Single Drugs; and Aim 4. Evaluate Model-Predicted Combination Therapies in Cell Culture and
Tumor Chips. We will combine computational modeling with state-of-the-art single cell RNAseq, spatial
transcriptomics, and flow cytometry to characterize cell state networks in gliomas and their dynamics, and how
they respond to a variety of glioma-relevant chemotherapy drugs. We will then use these models to propose
efficacious regimens that not only control growth but favorably modulate cell state transitions, and test them
using in-vivo like tumor chips. Furthermore, we will study how spatial arrangements of cell types and co-cultures
with primary neurons influence glioma behavior. Although the application is GBM, cell state networks are a
universal feature of cancer so findings here may have widespread significance across human cancers."

mitochondrial dysfunction in AD in order to reveal promising therapeutic targets. To approach this question, we
have collected a large amount of preliminary data to show that a E3 ubiquitin ligase, named neural precursor
cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4-like (Nedd4L), is associated with mitochondria and
regulates mitochondrial membrane potential. We further showed that Nedd4L is dephosphorylated in a familial
AD mouse model, APP/PS1 mice, and dephosphorylated Nedd4L ubiquitinates a mitochondrial outer membrane
protein mitofusion-2 (MFN2). Previous studies have observed downregulation of MFN2 in post-mortem patient
samples and animal models of AD and suggest a contribution of MFN2 downregulation in AD pathogenesis.
Based on these data and prior research, we hypothesize that dephosphorylation of Nedd4L in APP/PS1 mice
contributes to impaired mitochondrial function and neurodegeneration in part through ubiquitinating MFN2. We
will test this hypothesis with two aims. Aim 1 will employ multiple unique mouse models to determine how the
two major isoforms of Nedd4L differentially regulate mitochondrial functions and how dephosphorylation of
Nedd4L affects those functions. Aim 2 will employ a cell-permeable peptide to promote phosphorylation of
endogenous Nedd4L in vivo to assess the impacts of Nedd4L dephosphorylation on neuronal functions and
health in APP/PS1 mice. Our goals are to establish Nedd4L as an upstream regulator contributing to the
dysfunctions of MFN2 and mitochondria in APP/PS1 mice and to introduce approaches that can rectify or
ameliorate the impairment."

Compromised tissue integrity is a major cause of debility during aging. Emerging findings suggest critical
functions of lysosomes promoting tissue integrity. Our unpublished findings indicate key roles for C. elegans
PMK-1, a conserved p38 MAPK member, in promoting lysosome formation and tissue integrity during
development and aging. These non-cell autonomous functions signal between germline, epidermis and
nerve. Moreover, our data indicate that p38 MAPK acts on distinct targets in a tissue-specific and stage-
specific manner to promote lysosome function. It is not known how p38 MAPK signals between tissues to
coordinate lysosome function. We hypothesize that PMK-1 promotes lysosome function by signaling a cell
non-autonomous network regulating the regeneration and heterogeneity of lysosomes across tissues. Over
the next 2 years, the critical goals for this project are to: 1) define the PMK-1 interactome required for
lysosome regeneration, 2) reveal tissue and stage-specific functions of PMK-1 in lysosome regeneration
and heterogeneity, and 3) delineate tissue-specific contributions to PMK-1 cross-tissue signaling. We have
built an array of tools to deeply understand how p38 signaling regulates lysosome regeneration and
heterogeneity to promote tissue integrity. Our proposed interdisciplinary studies include proteomics, genetic
screens, biochemical analyses, and cell biology approaches to tackle this complex problem of
understanding non-cell autonomous p38 MAPK function. The long-term objective of the proposed studies is
to understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms of p38 MAPK signaling in tissue integrity during
development and aging."

Early-onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC; CRC diagnosed at < 50 years of age) is a known and worsening public
health problem, with alarming increases in incidence across the US, further complicated by lack of healthcare
access and poor outcomes among racial and ethnic minorities. Diagnosis for younger patients must rely on
symptomatic presentation or another trigger, as routine screening is not recommended for them.
Asymptomatic triggers for CRC testing are family history of CRC, precancerous polyps, genetic predisposing
syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, but these represent a small proportion of cases. A much larger
proportion of cases have patient report of “red-flag” symptoms (rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, unintentional
weight loss, constipation/diarrhea, or iron-deficiency anemia). However, even in the presence of these
symptoms, factors at multiple levels contribute to delayed diagnosis: low physician suspicion of cancer, failure
to recognize concerning symptoms, overlap of symptoms with other benign disorders, and patients’ lack of
knowledge about the disease. Consequently, younger patients are more likely to be misdiagnosed, experience
diagnostic delays, report longer duration of symptoms prior to testing, and be diagnosed at later stages. To
facilitate earlier diagnoses of EOCRC, we need to better understand prevalence of CRC test orders and receipt
for younger symptomatic patients, and explore the association of time-to-testing with cancer diagnoses,
especially among uninsured, underserved, minority patients.
We have a unique opportunity to generate important information about CRC test order and testing in light of
red-flag symptoms among a large and vulnerable group of younger safety-net patients seen in Dallas County’s
Parkland Health system. We will use existing electronic health records data (EHR) for patients aged 40-49
years from the current NIH-funded PROSPR cohort study, and extend it by extracting additional Parkland
EHR data for those aged 18-39 years, to develop a curated comprehensive colorectal timeline file for those in
the “early onset” age range of 18-49. Using data from these under- and uninsured minority patients, we aim to
describe EOCRC symptom burden and healthcare system interactions leading to CRC test order and test
receipt (Aim 1), and explore association of time-to-testing with cancer stage among patients with EOCRC (Aim
2).
Results from this study will generate epidemiologic evidence about CRC testing among younger under- and
uninsured symptomatic patients, with efficiency gained from use of 10 years of data from a current NIH-
funded cohort study and resultant algorithms. Results from this work can guide development of
recommendations generalizable to a diverse group of people, and generate future research questions to
understand appropriate EOCRC screening and follow-up in this vulnerable population."

The goal of this project is to shed light on the etiology of keratoconus (KC) by elucidating the bio-molecular
effects of environmental and genetic factors in vivo using a KC murine model with ultraviolet radiation (UV) and
in vitro using a novel cornea-on-a-chip model. Keratoconus, a progressive and degenerative disorder
characterized by localized thinning near or in the center of the cornea, affects an estimated 300,000 people in
the United States and is one of the leading causes of corneal transplant. Though still undetermined, it is widely
recognized that genetic and environmental risk factors contribute to KC pathogenesis. Previous work in our lab
has uncovered a gene of interest in a multi-generation family affected by KC, PPIP5K2. Subsequent gene-trap
and two knockin mouse models of Ppip5k2 demonstrated localized thinning in the center of the cornea but lacked
other histopathological and morphological characteristics seen in KC patients. Here we hypothesize that
incorporation of an environmental risk factor for KC, namely combined UVA and UVB radiation, in these Ppip5k2
gene-trap and knockin mice may sufficiently produce a reliable KC mouse model. This is especially important to
the study of KC as there is currently no sufficient animal model that represents both the underlying pathology
and morphological defects of the disorder. On the other hand, we will model the interaction of corneal epithelial
and stromal cells using a novel cornea-on-a-chip in vitro model to integrate cellular, genetic, biomechanical, and
environmental factors. This cornea-on-a-chip will allow us to study epithelial-stromal interactions in adjacent
layers of corneal tissue, specifically when treated with inflammatory factors similar to those produced
endogenously as a result of vigorous eye-rubbing and atopy. We hypothesize that KC-related genetic,
inflammatory, and biomechanical factors and their interactions affect the epithelial-stromal communication,
leading to the loss of stromal cells and corneal thinning. Our preliminary data indicate the promising potential of
these in vivo and in vitro models in advancing our understanding of KC pathogenesis. The successful completion
of this innovative application will lead to the establishment of in vitro and in vivo models closely mimicking the
pathophysiological processes in KC development, eventually helping develop novel therapies for this devastating
and critical vision disorder."
10998792,"Pioneering work by our MPI team established biomechanical signals as a critical driver of brown adipose tissue
(BAT) function. We demonstrated a new signaling cascade in interscapular BAT that integrates ß-adrenergic
signaling, PKA activation, Ca2+ release via L-type calcium channels, and myosin light chain kinase 1 (MLCK1)
activation. MLCK1 in turn stimulates force generation by myosin 7 (Myh7, a.k.a. cardiac/skeletal myosin heavy
chain beta) and translocation of YAP and TAZ to the nucleus, leading to greater UCP1 expression and enhanced
thermogenesis. Besides classical BAT, inducible beige adipocytes (BeAT) can also contribute to non-shivering
thermogenesis by forming UCP1-positive cells within white adipose tissue (WAT) depots and are thought to be
major drivers of non-shivering thermogenesis in adult humans. While BA are also activated by ß-adrenergic
signals, we found that BeAT do not express Myh7, raising the question of whether BeAT thermogenesis is driven
by contractile signals or some distinct mechanism. Here, we postulate that biointerfacial and biomechanical
forces regulate b-adrenergic receptor (b-AR) signaling in BeAT to link catecholamine signaling to BeAT
differentiation and induction of thermogenesis via Myh9-driven tension. Further, we propose that extracellular
matrix (ECM) modulates ß-AR signaling by integrating, at the level of FAK, myosin-based intracellular tension
signals with biomechanical extracellular matrix clues and outside-in integrin signaling resulting in spatio-temporal
control of BeAT induction."

Our program will develop a comprehensive genomic resource to characterize novel causes of unexplained
recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). We access large clinical service for RPL to prospectively procure carefully
phenotyped trios with fetal cells available from spontaneous pregnancy losses along with both parents’ DNA and
paternal germ cells. In addition, we leverage our large health-system wide Genomic Answers for Kids (GA4K)
program developed for understanding pediatric rare disease currently with over 5500 trios enrolled enriched for
prior pregnancy losses. Using these rich data and clinical resources, we aim to extend genetic testing workflow
by integrating our clinically deployed long-read genome sequencing (HiFi-GS) pipeline using PacBio Revio
allowing simultaneous DNA (cytosine) methylation in long, contiguous read (‘5-base HiFi-GS’) for the
identification of underexplored genomic variants and hidden functional features. We couple these third-
generation genomic analyses in trios with contemporary electronic medical records (EHR) and clinical and
population-based biobank resources (UK Biobank). The data integration will leverage and extend our preliminary
findings to test a central hypothesis that unexplained RPL is due to inherited or de novo changes in full genome
sequences. Specifically, we propose in Aim 1 to leverage GA4K’s and our hospital’s detailed clinical and
molecular diagnostic data together with dynamic access to EHR and extract pregnancy history to classify
molecular variation linked to RPL. We validate these links in thousands of RPL cases observed in UK Biobank
by identifying deleterious variants in the available exome sequencing data. In Aim 2 we utilize our high-
throughput 5-base HiFi-GS platform to consolidate all known molecular tests for genetic disease into a single
sequencing run for the identification of putative variants and complex DNA changes missed by clinical microarray
and unmeasured by standard GS. We will assess 100 unsolved rare disease families from GA4K with history of
pregnancy loss and 100 RPL trios. This 5-HiFi-GS resource will also allow unbiased information on skewed X-
inactivation and imprinting defects in fetal DNA, with poorly understood impacts on fetal viability. Finally, in Aim
3 we apply CpG methylation detection by 5-HiFi-GS in paternal germ cells (sperm) contrasting samples derived
from male partner with RPL with those who have proven paternity to compare levels of gonadal mosaicism for
genetic variants as well as epigenomic transmission observable in 5-HiFi-GS from paternal blood and sperm
together with fetal DNA. Expected results entail compendium of high-quality full RPL genomes to spark
community-wide research with novel insight to dozens of RPL genes linked to genetic disease and impacting
fetal viability."
10979847,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The past two decades have witnessed several air-borne viruses (SARS-CoV1, MERS, SARS-
CoV2) that led to significant mortality. There is always a lag time before a vaccine is introduced.
This lag creates an urgent need for a universal antiviral therapy that can be deployed rapidly as a
prophylactic measure. Here, we propose to address this gap by engineering a novel intranasal-
delivered nanoparticle that exerts an universal antiviral effect by activating a unique evolution-
encoded innate immune state in nasal epithelial cells to provide early protection. There is a strong
rationale for targeting nasal epithelium for an antiviral prophylaxis for air-borne viruses: (1) Nasal
epithelium is the most common portal of entry of these pathogens; (2) The nasal cavity and
nasopharynx contain some of the highest viral loads; and (3) Neutralizing the virus in the nasal
epithelium has been shown to not only decrease viral load in both the nasal cavity and in distant
sites, but potentially reduce transmission from asymptomatic individuals. While these studies
validate nasal delivery as an ideal route of administration for viral prophylaxis, an effective
universal antiviral therapy remains an unmet need. We hypothesize that activating an evolutionary
conserved antiviral mechanism, i.e. the induction of IFN-Induced proteins with tetratricopeptide
repeats 1 (IFIT1), can emerge as an effective universal prophylaxis against airborne viruses. This
can be achieved by inhibiting CMTR2, a novel target, in the nasal epithelium. We will: (Aim 1)
Engineer antiViral Response-Activating Nanoparticles (V-RANs) for intranasal delivery and test for
inhibition of CMTR2 and induction of IFIT1; (Aim 2) Evaluate the antiviral efficacy and safety of V-
RANs in mouse models of severe SARS coronavirus or pandemic flu infections; and in (Aim 3)
Elucidate the molecular mechanism of V-RAN-induced antiviral response. Published reports and
our preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this project. This study can lead to new
insights into intranasal nanodelivery, and a novel antiviral prophylaxis that can shift the paradigm
for early interventions in future pandemics."

Molecular basis of mRNA export
ABSTRACT
In eukaryotes, the genetic information encoded in the chromatin is stored within the nucleus. For genetic programs
to be executed, folded proteins, ribonucleic acids, and assembled macromolecular complexes must be transported
across the nuclear envelope. Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are exclusive gateways for the regulated
bidirectional exchange of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm. In humans, NPCs are assembled
from multiple copies of 35 different proteins known as nucleoporins (nups) that give rise to a ~1,000-protein
cylindrical structure spanning the nuclear envelope with a molecular mass of ~120 million Daltons. Due to its size
and flexibility, obtaining an atomic structure of the NPC has been a formidable task that we have overcome over
the last two decades with a divide-and-conquer approach. This approach relies on biochemical reconstitution and
nup-nup interaction mapping, along with high-resolution structure determination of nups and nup complexes,
combined with lower resolution cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) and in vivo validation. These efforts have
resulted in a near-atomic composite structure accounting for ~90% of the human NPC’s mass. However, critical
aspects of both its structure and function remain unexplored. The NPC’s cytoplasmic face harbors nups that
mediate interactions between mobile transport factors and their protein or ribonucleic acid cargoes, as well as the
machinery that dismantles messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) as they emerge from the NPC’s central
transport channel, irreversibly releasing mRNA into the cytoplasm. Notably, genetic variations in these nups are
prominently associated with various human diseases, including neurodegenerative and neoplastic disorders, and
heightened susceptibility to viral infections. We have previously reconstituted nup complexes of fungal NPCs’
cytoplasmic faces, enabling the systematic dissection of their nup-nup interactome. We now propose to perform
an equivalent reconstitution of the human NPC’s cytoplasmic face using recombinantly expressed and highly
purified proteins. Our second goal is to expand our high-resolution structural characterization to still unresolved
parts of the NPC. Third, we will functionally characterize previously identified RNA-binding events involving
cytoplasmic nups and the mobile RNA-transporting machinery by determining high-resolution structures and
assessing their functional relevance using in vitro activity assays and cell-based assays for nucleocytoplasmic
cargo transport. Finally, we will investigate the mechanism of action of the ORF6 virulence factor from SARS-CoV-2
and related sarbecoviruses. We will employ a multidisciplinary approach to gain atomic-level insights into ORF6's
interactions with the NPC and the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery, as well as the effects these interactions
have on nuclear transport, mRNA export, and NPC integrity. Overall, our research will contribute to understanding
the NPC’s role in mRNA export and the viral interference mechanisms targeting this process, providing atomic-
level detail toward addressing this fundamental cell biological question and the molecular basis for the development
of antiviral treatments."

 In this competitive renewal for the Academic-Industrial Partnership (R01CA235575) between the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Center and AstraZeneca, we will continue to advance the clinical translation of multiple re-
action monitoring mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) protein assays into the clinical trial setting. The MRM-MS tech-
nology is agnostic to the patient population. In the first funding cycle, our AIP successfully (a) optimized the MRM
assay technology for use on small clinical biospecimens; (b) developed and optimized reagents and SOPs for
controlling sample processing variation, calibrating assay results across samples & labs, maximizing sensitivity
of the platform for analysis of small volume clinical biospecimens, & improving methods for greater multiplexing;
(c) developed novel methods to account for microheterogeneity in tissue biospecimens; (d) achieved analytical
validation of MRM-based assay panels in our CLIA environment; (e) translated MRM-MS protein assays into
clinical trials, & (f) licensed the technology for commercialization. Data that we generated during the first funding
cycle uncovered an exciting opportunity and a new technological challenge. Specifically, some of the MRM-
based assays that we translated into clinical trials enabled quantification of phosphosignaling in the DNA Dam-
age Response (DDR) network. These assays are of high interest to our biopharmaceutical partners since the
DDR network is a major target for cancer drugs. Excitingly, our data indicate that analyzing DDR network signal-
ing through serial collections of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and after treatment can
provide meaningful pharmacodynamic data via a simple blood draw (vs invasive tissue sampling). Yet, the chal-
lenge lies in the low basal DDR signaling levels in PBMCs, hindering precise treatment effect quantification. To
address this, we've formed a collaboration with Rules Based Medicine (RBM) to develop a prototype ""DDR boost
tube,"" an extension of RBM's TruCulture® immune activation blood tubes. DDR Boost tubes are blood culture
tubes containing a DNA damaging agent. Our preliminary data demonstrate that incubating blood ex vivo in the
DDR Boost tubes activates DDR signaling in PBMCs, boosting basal signaling levels, & improving pharmacody-
namic measurements. In cycle 2 of funding, we will translate the integrated technologies (DDR Boost tubes +
streamlined MRM assay) into clinical trials via the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize the design of DDR
Boost tubes to maximize MRM signal-to-noise ratios & develop a streamlined DDR MRM assay panel that seam-
lessly integrates with the tubes. Aim 2: Investigate biospecimen preanalytical variables affecting DDR measure-
ments using the optimized DDR Boost tubes & develop an evidence-based Standard Operating Procedure for
clinical trial laboratory manuals. Aim 3. Validate the DDR Boost tubes in a prospective clinical trial. Successful
completion of this project will deliver a clinically validated, next-generation solution for pharmacodynamic, proof
of mechanism, and correlative study measurements in the context of DDR-targeting therapies- and offer a blue-
print for applying a comparable approach to additional cell signaling networks with therapeutic potential."

Kinases are essential to development and deregulation of their activity contributes to cancer
progression in multiple human malignancies. We recently demonstrated that the receptor tyrosine
kinase rearranged during transfection (RET) enforces the undifferentiated state in epidermal
progenitor cells and is aberrantly activated in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Our
long-term goal is to help develop topical selective RET inhibitors for effective therapeutic
prevention of cSCC. The overall objectives of this proposal are to (i) elucidate the molecular
mechanism(s) of RET regulation in human epidermis and (ii) define RET-regulated impacts on
the tumor immune microenvironment while demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy of targeting
RET for cSCC prevention. Our central hypothesis is that sustained expression of RET is an early
and actionable event in cSCC development that results from disruption of E3 ligase interaction,
enabling deregulation of downstream kinases and promoting immune escape through
downregulation of MHC expression. The rationale for this project is that a determination of RET
regulation and activation in the epidermis will create a strong conceptual framework for
development of therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling RET signaling, such as inhibiting RET
for effective secondary prevention of cSCC in at-risk persons. In the first Aim of our proposal, we
will test the central hypothesis by characterizing the RET-Siah1 interaction and defining the key
downstream branches regulated by epidermal RET. In the second Aim, we will investigate the
timing and consequences of RET activation during the progression of human cSCC from normal
skin to carcinoma in situ and evaluate the efficacy of targeting RET through genetic ablation or
pharmacologic inhibition on photocarcinogenesis in vivo. The research proposed in this
application is innovative, in our opinion, because it focuses on inhibiting a novel molecular target
to therapeutically restore terminal maturation as a means of skin cancer prevention. The proposed
research is significant because it is expected to justify preclinical and clinical studies on RET
inhibition for secondary prevention of cSCC. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to
reduce the incidence of skin cancer in this country."
10995411,"CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is the
most common monogenic form of small vessel diseases (SVDs) which underlie a large portion of vascular
cognitive impairment cases and a quarter of all stroke cases. Despite the identification of mutated NOTCH3 as
the site of pathology in two vascular cell types, endothelial cells (ECs) and smooth muscle cells, there is currently
no cure for CADASIL. Surprisingly, a third vascular cell type—pericytes—are virtually unstudied in the context of
CADASIL, despite ample expression of NOTCH3 protein and known roles in the control of cerebral blood flow
(CBF), which CADASIL patients exhibit early deficits in. Pericytes are found in the brain surrounding capillaries
and at least two forms of pericytes exist along distinct sections of the capillary tree. Contractile pericytes, one
such subtype, are located on the capillaries initially branching from the penetrating arterioles (PAs) that dive into
the brain parenchyma. Contractile pericytes can contract and relax rapidly to directly regulate capillary diameter
and thus modulate blood flow delivery to the downstream capillary tree. Pericyte contraction is in turn regulated
by membrane potential, which ECs can modulate via transcellular communication through gap junctions that can
be found in pericyte invaginations into EC membranes known as peg-and-socket junctions. Contractile pericyte
hyperpolarization collectively lowers Ca2+ levels which leads to contractile pericyte relaxation and dilation of the
underlying capillary. Our preliminary data indicates that contractile pericyte-mediated control of blood flow is
impaired earlier than other known CBF deficits in a classically used mouse model of CADASIL, thus pericytes
could be a target for early clinical intervention. Intriguingly, we observed that other mechanisms of pericyte blood
flow control are intact at this early timepoint despite diminished blood flow and capillary diameter responses to
EC hyperpolarization in capillaries covered in contractile pericytes. Our data strongly suggests that contractile
pericytes are unable to respond to capillary electrical signaling to induce membrane hyperpolarization. As gap
junctions between ECs and contractile pericytes control communication of signals between these cells, I propose
to elucidate whether EC-contractile pericyte gap junctions are altered in CADASIL and the downstream
ramifications of this disruption with pharmacological and optogenetic interventions in a transgenic mouse model
of CADASIL. To achieve this, I will use two-photon laser scanning microscopy in awake mice, a capillary-
parenchymal arteriole (CaPA) ex vivo preparation, electron microscopy, and electrophysiology, all to measure
perturbations of normal contractile pericyte physiology in this disease context. This work will provide novel insight
into a potential early-stage pathogenic mechanism of an early marker of CADASIL, positioning contractile
pericytes as a target of intervention to halt debilitating disease phenotypes. The training obtained under this
fellowship will provide deep and diverse training in the methodologies and professional development necessary
for my future success as an academic researcher at a biomedical institution."
10995720,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic pain affects between 40 to 100 million people in the US and managing this pain with opioids has
increased the incidence of opioid substance abuse and death from overdose. There is an urgent and unmet
need for effective chronic pain medications with lower misuse potential. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the
most abundant pharmacological agent found within Cannabis and acts via the endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling
system to produce analgesia. Thirty-eight US states have approved legal medical Cannabis for the
pharmacological treatment of pain and anxiety, alongside recreational use in many cases. However, the precise
neuropharmacological and physiological mechanisms of THC use for pain treatment, and the circuit mechanisms
that underlie the pain-relieving properties of THC are unknown. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a critical brain
region important for encoding affective information from incoming stimuli and is a key component in pain
processing. The BLA has increased neuronal activity during chronic pain, and glutamatergic neuronal ensembles
detect and report noxious stimuli to cortical structures that impact pain perception. The BLA has enriched
expression of the receptor sensitive to eCBs and THC, cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R). The central hypothesis
of this proposal is that THC acts as a partial agonist at CB1R to decrease excitatory BLA neuronal activity and
pain behaviors during chronic pain. This proposal directly addresses the 2022-2026 NIDA Strategic Plan Goal
1.1 to, “Expand our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying drug use, addiction, diverse
treatment responses…” and the NINDS 2021-2026 Strategic Plan to“… extend progress in prevention for
neurological diseases beyond stroke, building on basic research advances in epilepsy, TBI, neurodegenerative
diseases, chronic pain...” Aim 1 will determine whether THC acts within the BLA at CB1Rs to alter glutamatergic
neuronal activity to promote analgesia during chronic pain. In this aim, we will multiplex classic
neuropharmacology and dual-color fiber photometry with a machine learning-based behavioral tracking platform
to directly correlate local THC-action and neural activity with naturalistic chronic pain behaviors. We then propose
in Aim 2 to decode how and where THC alters specific BLAglu neuronal ensemble activity during chronic pain.
We will use in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging, a CRISPR site-specific CB1R deletion strategy, and a head-fixed
behavioral paradigm to observe glutamatergic BLA neuronal ensembles during pain. These findings will provide
foundational knowledge informing the cannabinoid, substance abuse, neuropharmacology, and pain fields. For
this proposal, I will gain training and expertise in the use of pharmacological, novel biological and high resolution
computational techniques and learn valuable career development skills through a wide variety of scientific,
intellectual, and mentored opportunities. This F31 proposal is specifically tailored to my personal training needs
and career aspirations that will prepare me for a career as an independent academic neuropharmacologist."
10992314,"Title: Shared Resource Core
Summary/abstract
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) have multisystem
complications that are serious, progressive, and often disabling. A better understanding of the novel
mechanisms of DM and FSHD has led to identifying several good therapeutic targets. Advances have occurred
more quickly than expected with several experimental drugs in development or clinical trials. There is now
renewed urgency to enhance the translational resources needed to facilitate current and future studies and
clinical trials. To achieve this goal, several aims of the shared resource core propose to sustain and enhance the
resources of the oldest and most comprehensive Registry for patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1),
type 2 (DM2), and FSHD. The National Registry for DM and FSHD Patients and Family Members has
facilitated research for 23 years with the same overarching goals to assist researchers in the recruitment of
patients for clinical studies and trials, to develop an extensive database of longitudinal patient information, and
to promote community outreach with patients, family members, clinicians, and researchers. Core Registry
methods include patient-reported questionnaires and curated medical records, annual surveys to track disease
progression, and researchers applying to access data or for assistance with recruitment. Overall, the Registry
has functioned effectively, but several changes are needed to make it more effective in the future. First, the core
activity and methods of the National Registry described above will be sustained to help maintain two-way
communication between researchers and patients and to help advance research on muscular dystrophy. A
second aim is to expand the Registry dataset and prepare for targeted recruitment based on clinical and genetic
characteristics in DM1. Highlights of this aim include incorporating remote genetic and clinical
characterization of Registry members with DM1, including quantified assessments of strength, function, and
myotonia. A third aim is to expand & diversify Registry engagement and prepare for comparative studies of
long-term drug effects. Specific tasks include recruiting patients from neuromuscular clinics not typically near
DM and FSHD research centers, translating forms to Spanish, and expanding online presence and enrollment.
A fourth goal is to promote research on understudied manifestations of DM and FSHD, which have important
implications for quality of life. This goal builds upon current data in the Registry on several topics important to
patients, such as gastrointestinal manifestations in DM, vision problems in FSHD, and neoplasms in DM. A key
proposal here is to add data to the Registry on women’s health in DM and FSHD and expand data collection on
smooth muscle involvement in DM and gastrointestinal and genitourinary assessments in FSHD. Overall, the
Shared Resource Core will serve the needs of researchers in our Center, the larger community of investigators
who study autosomal dominant forms of muscular dystrophy, and the patients and families living with these
disorders."
10992318,"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by expanded CTG repeats in exon 15 of DMPK, whereas myotonic
dystrophy type 2 (DM2) is caused by expanded CCTG repeats in intron 1 of CNPB. DM1 and DM2 are the first
genetic diseases recognized to result from RNA toxicity, a complex process that reflects an interplay of
synthesis and turnover of expanded RNA repeats, and phase separation of repeat RNA and binding proteins in
nuclear condensates, or foci. DM1 is one of the most variable genetic diseases known to medicine, where onset
can occur at any time from mid-gestation to 7th decade. The DM1 expanded repeat is genetically unstable,
resulting in a wide range of different repeat lengths. Clinical variability of DM1 was attributed to differences of
repeat length, reflecting repeats that a person inherits (progenitor allele length) and additional length that
arises through somatic expansion, an age-dependent growth which occurs at different rates in different tissues.
Initial studies indicated that clinical variability is mainly attributable to progenitor allele length, but this was
not confirmed in recent studies. Further, the severity of involvement in individual muscles is not associated
with repeat length in tissue: all adult DM1 patients show large expansions in muscle, regardless of whether the
muscle is heavily affected or not. Here we will re-assess the association of repeat length with disease severity,
using a new platform for clinical assessment, remote study visits (RSVs), and a new molecular assay for repeat
length. We posit that while somatic expansion is necessary for DM1 onset and progression, and occurs in all
patients, it does not account for between-patient variability. Instead, we postulate that clinical variability
reflects differences in how large expansions manifest as RNA toxicity. Discovering the genetic determinants of
these differences, which are currently unknown, will require genome-wide unbiased analyses. First, however, it
is necessary to clarify the predictive value of repeat length, determine the residual variance that is not
attributable to repeat length, and establish new methods to assemble large cohorts and analyze their repeat
lengths, as proposed here in a cohort of 600 patients. We also will investigate the mechanisms for RNA toxicity
in DM2, which has added complexity that repeats are very large and located in an intron. We will focus on
aspects of DM2 that are most critical for selecting an effective therapeutic approach: 1) is the expanded CCUG-
repeat RNA causing toxicity an excised intron that is actively undergoing degradation, or a retained intron in
the CNBP mRNA; and (2) does the repeat RNA undergo repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation in
muscle. Resolving these questions is critical to ensure that therapeutic strategies that are now in clinical trials
for DM1 can be safely and effectively applied to DM2. Taken together, the proposed studies will clarify the
genetic determinants of DM1 severity, improve genetic counseling for DM1 families, establish a novel platform
to improve DM1 patient engagement in clinical research, create a path for future genome-wide analysis, and
point to the most productive strategies for treating DM2."
10991538,"Summary
Successful control of chronic virus and cancer critically depends on our improved understanding of the cellular
and molecular mechanisms of T cell exhaustion. CD8 T cells responding to persistent antigens during chronic
infection and cancer gradually differentiate into a dysfunctional state, commonly known as T cell exhaustion.
Exhausted T cells acquire a unique and permanent epigenetic profile, which severely limits their functional
reinvigoration. Recent studies from us and others reveal that the “exhausted” T cell pool consists of multiple
phenotypically, functionally, and transcriptionally distinct subsets. Importantly, a TCF-1hi progenitor (TPRO)
subset functions as a population of resource cells that continuously replenishes the pool of terminally
exhausted T cells (TEXH) during chronic infection and cancer. Interestingly, we recently show that some TPRO
cells can break away from the path toward exhaustion and differentiate into a CX3CR1+ effector subset (TEFF)
with enhanced killing ability, which can be exploited as cellular therapies to control chronic viral infection and
cancer in animal models. Furthermore, recent research demonstrates that the formation of these distinct CD8
T cell subsets is governed by underlying transcriptional programs. For example, TCF-1, T-bet and TOX act as
subset-specific TFs to regulate the differentiation of TRPO, TEFF and TEXH, respectively. Perturbation of genetic
pathways can be exploited to skew CD8 T cell differentiation trajectory toward effector subset and limit T cell
exhaustion. Thus, the high-throughput discovery of novel transcription factors (TFs) that regulate the
phenotypic heterogeneity of CD8 T cells and rapidly validate their biological function in the animal models is
highly sought-after. Taking advantage of recently developed technologies in single cell sequencing and
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we propose to screen a set of novel TFs selected computationally based on their
“regulon” activity in the respective subsets of CD8 T cells. This more targeted selection of candidate TFs
combined with the high-throughput screen by perturb-seq will greatly expedite the discovery of novel
transcriptional programs that regulate CD8 T cell differentiation and cell-fate choice. Furthermore, we will
validate the function of the top-hits TFs identified by Perturb-seq via employing both loss-of-function and gain-
of-function approaches to test the role of them in pathogen-specific CD8 T cells in vivo during chronic viral
infection. The successful completion of this high-throughput, rapid and cost-effective CRISPR screen and
functional validation of novel TFs in CD8 T cell differentiation will gain new knowledge in transcriptional
regulation of T cell exhaustion. It will also provide mechanistic insights into therapeutic designs in treating
cancer and infectious diseases."

This NRSA F30 fellowship will provide the groundwork that will prepare the applicant for a career
in academic medicine as a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist. Much of the applicant’s career
development will come from work in alcohol and cardiovascular-related research. Alcohol-related
Cardiomyopathy (AC) manifests in humans after excessive alcohol consumption and is
characterized by ventricular dilation and cardiac function impairment. During cardiac inflammation
and injury, fibroblasts differentiate into myofibroblasts, which are larger in cell size and express
higher levels of collagens and their crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX). Here, the role of
TRAF3IP2, a proinflammatory cytoplasmic adapter protein, in the pathogenesis of AC is explored.
Preliminary data indicates that exposure of naïve cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to alcohol induces
TRAF3IP2 protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In our studies, we will
investigate whether i) alcohol-induced cardiac fibroblast activation, and proinflammatory cytokine
and extracellular matrix expression are dependent on TRAF3IP2 and ii) global TRAF3IP2 gene
deletion prevents alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation, fibrosis, and dysfunction.
The cellular mechanism underlying alcohol-induced cardiac inflammation and fibrosis are
investigated using both in vitro and in vivo alcohol exposure. In vitro, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using
naïve CF from wild-type mice transduced with TRAF3IP2 shRNA and CF isolated from
homozygous TRAF3IP2 knockout mice. In vivo, TRAF3IP2 is targeted using global TRAF3IP2-
knockout mice on a 30-day Lieber-DeCarli or isocaloric control liquid diet based on the
chronic+binge model. Endpoint measures include induction of proinflammatory and profibrotic
pathways.
Using the chronic+binge model of AC, TRAF3IP2-KO and littermate controls are exposed to
chronic alcohol consumption. Endpoints include assessment of cardiac function and chamber
dimensions by echocardiography and pressure-volume left ventricular catheterization. Markers of
inflammation and fibrotic measures include collagens I and III, LOX expression, left ventricle total
collagen, and histological assessment of interstitial fibrosis by PSR staining.
Ultimately, these studies may identify novel, therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol-
related cardiomyopathy. With the support of a strong mentoring team, completion of the proposed
research and training plan will ensure that the applicant is prepared for an impactful career as a
physician-scientist."

This grant application requests funds to partially support the 2024 Streptococcal Biology Gordon Research
Conference (GRC) and its associated Seminar (GRS). This will be the third meeting of this GRC, which has been
highly successful in its prior years of 2018 and 2022. This will also be the 2nd meeting of the GRS, whose purpose
is to foster development of the next generation of investigators and invite their active participation and integration
into the broader research community. Both meetings will be held at the Grand Summit Hotel at Sunday River,
Newry, Maine, USA. The GRS is to be held August 10-11, and the GRC August 11-16. The 2024 Chairs are Drs.
Michael Federle and Jan-Willem Veening, who served as Co-Vice Chairs in 2022. Drs.
Kimberly Kline and Jose
Lemos
will serve as Co-Vice Chairs and then will Chair the 2026 meeting. Postdoctoral fellows
Luke Joyce and
Kristin Huse
will Co-Chair the GRS. The GRS/GRC program encompasses a wide range of exciting topics among
important human and animal pathogens from the genera Streptococcus and Enterococcus. Topics will include
genomics, virulence regulation, antimicrobial resistance, new antimicrobial targets, host-pathogen interactions,
clinical findings, microbial communities, and advancing therapeutics. Invited speakers and discussion leaders
will address the most current and exciting topics in the field. The overall goal is to bring the world’s leading
scientists and the most promising young investigators and trainees together in a collegial and supportive
environment. The specific goals are to: 1) provide a forum for the presentation of unpublished, cutting-edge
research on streptococci and enterococci and foster formal and informal discussions on how these results
advance the field; 2) include investigators and clinicians focusing on diverse streptococcal species and define
the impact of these on infection; 3) expand the boundaries of the work of the scientists within this field; and 4)
ensure development and integration of young investigators, including those in under-represented groups into the
broader research community in a meaningful and interactive way.The collegial atmosphere will include organized
discussion sessions during talks and poster sessions and opportunities for informal gatherings in the afternoons
and evenings, providing an ideal setting for scientists from different disciplines to exchange ideas and foster
cross-disciplinary collaborations among peers and the next generation of investigators. Thus, these events will
provide a fundamentally important opportunity not currently offered to this field in any other global venue, to bring
together leading investigators in a format designed for the free exchange of research results and ideas covering
all aspects of streptococcal biology and its relationship to disease. Together with the GRS, the GRC will promote
diversity, equity and inclusion and the development of promising young investigators in the field and their
integration into the larger research community. In the short term, this will significantly enhance the ability of
investigators around the world to address critical problems in streptococcal and enterococcal diseases, while in
the long term it will ensure the continued success of their efforts and those of the next generation of investigators."
10991978,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) plays critical roles in synaptic plasticity including experience/adaptive-based
changes in brain function suggesting an inherent malleability in ECM structure. Although changes in ECM
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and proteases contribute to ECM remodeling, the underlying
mechanisms that enable ECM plasticity are still unknown. Our central hypothesis is that functional amyloids,
including CRES (cystatin-related epididymal spermatogenic) subgroup members, and extracellular nucleic acids
are critical elements of the brain ECM infrastructure that allow its adaptability, including sex-specific responses.
We hypothesize also that alterations or loss of these components change brain ECM structure resulting in altered
functions that can lead to pathologies such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The objective of this R21 proposal is
to: 1) establish that amyloids, including CRES, and extracellular nucleic acids are components of the mouse and
human brain ECM using amyloid-specific reagents and biochemical and biophysical approaches; and 2)
determine the sex-specific contributions of CRES/CRES amyloid to ECM structure using a CRES KO mouse
model. Collectively, our studies will identify entirely new structural elements in the brain ECM and suggest a
novel mechanism by which the brain ECM can remodel enabling plasticity and sex-specific responses."
10992010,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding how specific neurons in a selectively vulnerable region such as the EC are affected is critical to
unraveling the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease onset. We and others have shown that neuronal
hyperexcitability is the key driver that makes pathologies and symptoms worse and ameliorating hyperexcitability
slows down AD-related symptoms. However, it is unclear if the hyperexcitability is due to an increased firing of
excitatory neurons or decreased firing of inhibitory neurons. We aim to understand the mechanisms underlying
hyperexcitability by studying the excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the EC of App and tau knockin mice.
To determine which type of neurons are affected early in the EC, we will investigate: Aim 1- Excitatory neurons
in the App knockin (AppNL-G-F) and tau knockin (hTau-KI) mice by using intersectional approach with
optogenetics and chemogenetics in combination with electrophysiology recordings and behavior and Aim 2-
Inhibitory neurons (parvalbumin- PV and somatostatin- SST) in the AppNL-G-F and hTau-KI mice as in aim 1.
Using Cre-specific mice to target excitatory and inhibitory neurons in combination with opto- or chemo- genetic
approach we will not only identify selectively vulnerable neuron-type, but we will also modulate their activities to
restore their function and test if behavioral deficits are reversed. We will use novel computational approaches
such as decoding and remapping to detect subtle changes in firing activity of EC neurons. We will also assess
how amyloid beta or tau affect different neuron types in the EC, and if downstream hippocampal neurons are
affected too. The results of the proposal will definitively answer if hyperexcitability of neurons due to AD
pathologies is caused by dysfunction of excitatory or inhibitory neurons. The sensitive computational methods
used in this proposal allow for measurement of subtle electrophysiological changes not possible previously and
therefore might allow for development of better diagnostic tests that could be translated and modified for clinical
use in humans.
Overall, the proposal aims to identify which neurons in the MEC are most vulnerable to AD pathology. The
proposal is highly innovative as it will use a combination of sophisticated in vivo recording in two AD mouse
models in combination with optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to identify specific cell type and modulate
neuronal firing to restore function. The results from the study will be highly significant as therapeutic or clinical
approaches to target vulnerable cell type could be identified. The proposal brings together diverse fields
(electrophysiology, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques to
record ensemble populations of neurons to interrogate what causes hyperexcitability in a vulnerable brain region
that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer’s disease."
10996284,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Cognitive changes occur as a normal process of aging and among the most important changes in cognition in
normal aging are declines in cognitive flexibility (CF). CF is considered a core aspect of executive functioning
and describes an individual’s ability to adapt their behavior and thinking to a changing environment.
Disruptions in CF impact functional independence, communication with others, and socialization. Despite the
well-documented prevalence of CF decline in aging, and its exacerbation in neurodegeneration, the
mechanisms that lead to structural and functional changes involved in the regulation of CF are not well
understood. The majority of studies related to CF impairment have focused on changes within the
hippocampus and cortex, however, the dorsal striatum, particularly the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), has long
been strongly associated with CF. The dorsal striatum is traditionally associated with control of motor function,
but recent human fMRI and PET analyses demonstrated that declines in striatal function predict declining
cognitive abilities during aging. Striatal function is governed by the innervation of two excitatory glutamatergic
circuits: cortico- (C-S) and thalamo-striatal (T-S). Importantly, T-S synapse density preferentially declines
during aging and is associated with declining CF performance. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which
T-S synapses are preferentially lost in the aging striatum and how they contribute to CF decline is unknown.
Depletion of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), a transcription factor canonically known for its role in
cellular stress responses, within the striatum, accelerates T-S synapse loss and results in impairment of CF.
HSF1 levels also decrease in aging and HSF1 has been shown to directly regulate the transcription of synaptic
genes within the striatum and other brain regions. Taken together, the goal of this proposal is: 1) to determine
the molecular underpinning that govern the differential effects of HSF1-mediated synaptic regulation within the
DMS and 2) to understand the role of HSF1 and T-S synapses in striatal dysfunction and CF impairment. I
will fill these gaps in knowledge through two complementary aims. In Aim 1, I will examine the role of HSF1 in
the regulation of the synaptoproteome of excitatory striatal projections through proteomic analyses of T-S and
C-S synaptic terminals and synapses from a conditional HSF1 knock-out mouse. In Aim 2, I will assess the
contribution of striatal HSF1 to CF by deleting HSF1 within the adult DMS using AAVs expressing Cre-
recombinase and the necessity of T-S connectivity to CF by optostimulation of T-S terminals in DMS.
Successful completion of this proposal will provide a mechanistic understanding of how synaptic dysfunction
within the DMS contributes to CF which has implications in aging and neurodegeneration, as well as establish
the role of HSF1 in the regulation of striatal glutamatergic synapses and CF that may result in new therapeutic
strategies to prevent CF deficits in the aging population."

The prevalence of diet-related diseases and health conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular
diseases are higher among Black/African-Americans (AA) in comparison to white counterparts. Reduced
access to healthy and fresh produce has been linked to unhealthy dietary intakes and high rates of diet-related
chronic diseases. Individuals residing in low-income, minority neighborhoods where there is low access to
healthy foods often suffer from disproportionately high levels of obesity and other diet-related health conditions.
Building on our preliminary studies addressing the lack of food access and community trauma in underserved
neighborhoods, the FRESH-EATS project includes multiple intervention components to address multilevel
factors that influence food access and dietary behaviors of families with school-aged children in low-income
predominantly Black/AA neighborhoods. Utilizing the NIMHD Minority Health and Health Disparities Research
Framework, we propose to determine the feasibility of examining intervention implementation and outcome
measures using a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In the FRESH-EATS project, there are four unique
intervention components: (1) Evidence-based hands-on cooking and nutrition education (6-weekly 90-minute
sessions – individual and interpersonal); (2) Family workshops addressing the lack of access to healthy foods
and systematic disparities in food environment (two 90 minute sessions – interpersonal and community); (3)
Weekly food delivery throughout the intervention period and local food pantry information (community and
societal); and (4) Community garden utilization providing fresh ingredients and garden education incorporated
into the educational sessions (community and societal). The central hypothesis is that the FRESH-EATS is
feasible to implement and improve dietary behaviors of children (ages 8-12) and their parents/caregivers that
potentially reduce the risks of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, compared to individual-level education-only
control. We will refine and finalize the intervention components (Aim 1) and determine the feasibility of the
FRESH-EATS project using an RCT design (Aim 2). We hypothesize that this innovative community-derived,
multilevel-multicomponent intervention is feasible to implement and has the potential to improve dietary
behaviors of participants (children ages 8-12 and their parents/caregivers). The long-term goal is to establish
sustainable food systems that support healthy eating habits and reduce health disparities among residents in
low-income minority communities, which is closely aligned with the NIMHD strategic vision and objectives."

Synapses in the nervous system are key in signal transmission, computation, and learning. They adaptively
modify during information processing and storage, influencing behavioral responses while maintaining synaptic
stability. Homeostatic signaling plays a crucial role at synaptic, neuronal and circuit levels, ensuring stable
neuronal function and network activity within physiological limits, essential for consistent brain functionality.
Disruptions in these homeostatic signaling pathways are linked to neurological disorders including epilepsy,
schizophrenia, and neurodegeneration. The molecular architecture of homeostatic signaling in the nervous
system remains to be elucidated. Our research focuses on the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a
model synapse for understanding synaptic homeostatic control mechanisms. At this glutamatergic synapse,
inhibiting postsynaptic glutamate receptors triggers a compensatory increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter
release, maintaining synaptic strength. This process, known as Presynaptic Homeostatic Potentiation (PHP), is
a conserved phenomenon across species. PHP begins with reduced glutamate receptor activity on the
postsynaptic side, but manifests as enhanced presynaptic neurotransmitter release. This indicates a need for
retrograde signaling to counteract postsynaptic changes and restore baseline muscle excitation. Previous
studies highlight the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein Multiplexin, Drosophila homologue to
mammalian collagen XV/XVIII, in PHP. Particularly, its C-terminal domain, Endostatin, released upon proteolytic
cleavage, facilitates neurotransmitter release during PHP via presynaptic calcium channels. The protease
responsible for releasing Endostatin from Multiplexin is still unknown. Drosophila has two matrix
metalloproteinases, MMP1 and MMP2. Our preliminary data, derived from a CRISPR-generated mmp2null mutant,
indicate MMP2's essential role in PHP induction and maintenance. This project aims to systematically investigate
the role of MMP2 in PHP, employing multifaceted techniques including electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry,
biochemistry, confocal calcium imaging, and super resolution imaging. AIM1 focuses on dissecting MMP2's cell-
specific function in PHP and whether MMP2 directly cleaves Multiplexin to release Endostatin during PHP. AIM2
delves into the cellular mechanisms of MMP2 in modulating presynaptic calcium influx and calcium channel
localization during PHP. This study will elucidate key signaling elements in the dynamic regulation of ECM during
PHP and provide valuable insights into synaptic stabilization mechanisms."

 Solid tumors account for nearly 90% of adult cancers and are challenging to eliminate. Surgery and
adjuvant therapy (e.g., radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy) are powerful methods for treating solid
tumors. Still, they are not universally effective or curative, and would benefit significantly from some means of
augmenting the tumor-killing response. Local delivery of cytotoxic, immunostimulatory, and gene therapy agents,
especially in combinations, has proven very effective in promoting solid tumor clearance. Given this potential, it
would be powerful to have a platform that sustainably and simultaneously delivers multiple immunostim-
ulatory and gene-therapy payloads directly at the tumor, thus promoting its clearance. While current
strategies, such as local drug delivery, lentivirus, and mRNA delivery methods, could generate such modifica-
tions, they suffer limitations for broader use such as permanent modifications and off-target effects (lentivirus),
transient gene expression (mRNA) and drug release, and limited payload. Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) has
shown great promise for prolonged and non-integrative therapeutic gene expression and coupled with lipid na-
noparticles (LNPs) could serve as a viable method for local gene delivery and tumor modification. Until recently
the potent early immune response triggered upon entry of saRNA into the cell has severely constraining the
potency of saRNA, with standard strategies for lowering RNA immunogenicity such as incorporating the modified
nucleoside N1-methyl-pseudouridine (found in all mRNA COVID vaccine) yielding non-functional saRNA. How-
ever, we have recently discovered that complete substitution of saRNA with the 5 methylcytidine (5mC) drasti-
cally reduces immune recognition of saRNA while preserving saRNA replication and gene expression capabili-
ties, leading to elevated and prolonged transgene expression. This powerful discovery empowers the appli-
cation of saRNA for other therapeutic applications and provides an opportunity to optimize these thera-
pies for efficient, multiplex gene delivery. To achieve this, I propose studies for optimizing the saRNA platform
by two approaches. The first approach (aim 1) will involve screening both saRNA and LNP formulation to opti-
mize their gene delivery across a panel of tumor types, using our best-performing saRNA to express an innova-
tive gene drive cassette that would selectively enrich the expression of a suicide gene in the tumor and overcome
drug resistance. The second approach (Aim 2) will focus on maximizing transgene cargo in saRNA, screening
1) how many genes can be encoded in a single saRNA by implementing RNA sequence elements, and 2) the
maximum possible length of saRNA that can be successfully delivered. This work will establish new bench-
marks for RNA therapeutics, providing a platform for efficiently delivering the next generation of gene-
therapies for solid tumor treatment."

 The healing of large bone defects resulting from traumatic injuries, fracture nonunion, and tumor resection
remains a significant clinical challenge. Approximately 500,000 patients undergo bone transplants each year in
the US alone and bone diseases and their complications account for half of chronic disease among individuals
greater than 50 years old. Common surgical interventions such as autologous, allogenic, or xenogeneic bone
grafts can suffer from serious limitations (e.g., availability of grafts, donor site morbidity and pain, incompatibility,
immunogenic reactions, and infectious disease). Therefore, researchers have explored tissue engineering
approaches to develop suitable bone replacements or regeneration strategies; however, these approaches can
be complicated by a heavy, persistent immune response and inadequate vascularization throughout large
constructs in vivo. We aim to use a multifactorial approach to regenerating bone tissue by harnessing the
regenerative potential of the MSC secretome, specifically extracellular vesicles (EVs), in combination with
controlled released from porous biomaterial scaffolds. We hypothesize that controlled release of anti-
inflammatory and pro-angiogenic EVs from granular hydrogels will create a pro-healing microenvironment and
promote scaffold vascularization, improving overall bone formation by endogenous cells in critical-sized defects.
 First, we will systematically identify granular hydrogel properties (e.g., porosity, stiffness, bioactive molecule
presentation) that promote MSC secretion of EVs enriched with anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors
(Aim 1). Next, we will use glycoengineering approaches to produce modified EVs that can be conjugated to our
granular scaffolds via strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC) chemistries before encapsulating
cells within EV-laden scaffolds to investigate the influence anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic EVs on
macrophage polarization and vascularization, respectively, in vitro (Aim 2). We will then fabricate granular
hydrogels using heterogeneous populations of microgels to vary in vivo degradation and enable temporal control
over EV release profiles. We will conduct a short-term (7 days) rat subcutaneous implant study to test the
capacity of EV-laden granular scaffolds to modulate early inflammation and vessel invasion, providing iterative
feedback on scaffold design. Finally, we will interrogate the ability of these complex granular scaffolds to
modulate inflammation, vascularization, and osteogenesis to promote bone regeneration by endogenous cells
in a rat critical-sized calvarial defect model (Aim 3). This proposal will utilize sophisticated experimental
techniques to explore the complexities of cell-cell, cell-matrix, and cell-EV interactions. The contributions of this
proposal would significantly impact the wide array of regenerative medicine strategies focused on granular
hydrogels, extracellular vesicle therapeutics, and bone tissue engineering."

Depression and anxiety are prevalent, debilitating, and poorly understood disorders. RDoC charts the nature of
these conditions across multiple units, but the domains are based on expert consensus, permitting bias and
missed opportunities. Moreover, little is known about how adversity affects RDoC constructs and contributes to
psychopathology. Thus, there is a critical need to rigorously evaluate RDoC domains in developmental samples
from diverse backgrounds at increased risk for exposure to adversity and later psychopathology. We will use
data-driven analytics to design, apply and validate multilevel-multimodal models of Threat and Reward
constructs in an existing longitudinal cohort at risk for psychopathology. To predict internalizing symptoms, we
will identify biotypes cross-sectionally and examine the longitudinal plasticity of RDoC-informed biotypes. Harsh
social-ecological conditions will be deeply assessed and used to forecast the onset/intensification of internalizing
symptoms at multiple units. We will assess 500 young adults from The Future of Families and Child Wellbeing
Study (FFCWS), an ongoing study of children born to predominantly low-income families. Attributes of the
FFCWS are: 1) children were assessed at birth, 1, 3, 5, 9, 15 years; 2) the sample is representative of people
born in cities and, thus, unlike almost all other neuroimaging research, findings are generalizable; 3) Although a
full range of incomes and race/ethnicities are represented, there is substantial representation of low-income
families and Black/African-American families, populations often under-represented in research; and 4)
participants are entering early adulthood, a period of heightened risk for psychopathology. We will assess Threat
and Reward at four units of analysis: symptoms, task-based behaviors, and brain and link these units to exposure
to adversity. The central hypothesis is that the RDoC Threat and Reward constructs will each cluster across
individuals and units, are distinct from each other, and have specific socio-ecological predictors. We will examine
multisource/multimodal data structure in 500 participants longitudinally at two timepoints, ages 22 and 24. Our
transdisciplinary team of experts positions us well to elucidate the structure of the Threat and Reward constructs
and map risk for internalizing biotypes. However, due to 18+ months of COVID restrictions and impacts on
participation, as well as increased costs for participation, recruitment requires more resources than pre-COVID,
particularly to recover recruitment milestones after 18+ lost months of recruitment time. To achieve our
recruitment goals and obtain necessary statistical power, the current supplement will add three more recruiters
and three more staff members for data collection to increase our recruitment and visits capacity dramatically. By
deeply phenotyping a large cohort enriched for low income and African American participants, we will determine
the validity of Threat/Reward and findings will generalize to a population underrepresented in research and
disproportionately affected by adversity."
10976216,"Project Summary / Abstract
Successful development of gene-based therapeutics, including gene delivery and RNA interference
(RNAi)-based therapies, requires establishing the mechanism by which gene mutations contribute to
pathogenesis. For instance, therapeutics for Loss of Function (LoF) mutations will be focused on
increasing gene expression, possibly through viral gene delivery. The development of gene-based
therapies for dominant disorders based on Gain of Function (GoF) or Dominant Negative (DN)
mechanisms is more complex. For GoF mutations, researchers have mainly focused on using RNAi
to knockdown gene expression that targets both the mutant and wild-type allele. However, in many
cases, the reduction of the single wild-type allele may have deleterious consequences. For DN
diseases, knockdown of both alleles will unlikely be successful as the ratio of mutant:wild-type protein
is not expected to change. One method to overcome these limitations is to develop RNAi that are
specific to the actual mutation, however, single base pair discrimination is technically very challenging
and would require a different therapeutic for each mutation. Based on these premises, there is a dire
need to develop mutant-specific RNAi for the therapeutic treatment of diseases resulting from
dominant mutations with a GoF or DN pathogenic mechanism. We have recently developed a novel
method for mutant specific RNAi which overcomes the limitations described. Here, we will focus on
advancing this technology through the comprehensive development of therapeutics for ALS/FTD. The
objective of this application is to identify and develop potential therapeutics for the allele-specific
knockdown of mutant alleles in the TARDBP and KIF5A genes which are causative for ALS/FTD. To
test our hypothesis, we have designed two specific aims: (1) To Design and Evaluate Allele-
Specific ASOs for TARDBP/KIF5A. ASOs spanning target regions will be tested for mutant-specific
knockdown within isogenic iPSC-derived cortical neurons (iCNs) harboring either TARDBP or KIF5A
mutations. Further modifications will be incorporated as needed to improve allelic discrimination,
potency, and possible toxic effects. (2) To Evaluate the Rescue of Allele-Specific ASOs in Mutant
TARDBP/KIF5A iCNs. IPSc-derived neurons harboring mutant TARDBP/KIF5A display alterations in
gene expression, alternative/cryptic splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and survival. Here, we will
evaluate the rescue of these defects by mutant specific ASOs to isogenic iCNs harboring mutations in
TARDBP/KIF5A. Impact: This study will provide a comprehensive development of allele specific-
ASOs (AS-ASOs) for mutations in TARDBP/KIF5A. Undoubtedly, AS-ASOs will have broad
applications for therapeutic development across numerous genes contributing to ALS and numerous
other human diseases."

A critical barrier to realizing the promise of prevention in the academic Learning Health System (aLHS) is the
insufficient number of investigators with the skills to cross the research-practice chasm and create health
systems in which new knowledge is integrated into clinical practice, not just for treatment but to prevent disease
and improve population health. We propose to develop clinician prevention scientists – who are grounded in
several rapidly evolving, but infrequently integrated focus areas and competencies, including: 1) health equity
and health disparities research (including measurement of disparities; stakeholder engagement; leadership and
research management; systems science and organizational change; and addressing social determinants of
health and promoting health equity); 2) development and implementation of prevention interventions (including
research questions and standards of scientific evidence; ethics of research and implementation in health systems
and the community; and study design and development of multi-level interventions); and 3) methodological and
statistical approaches (including implementation science methods; health system research methods; biomedical
informatics; biostatistics and data science; and scientific communication). We propose an innovative academic
Learning Health System Preventions for PRomoting Health Equity (aLHS-PRE) T32 program to provide the next
generation of clinician prevention scientists with the methodological and professional skills to conduct rigorous
research in complex multi-level environments across multiple domains, including health systems, and to
disseminate and implement findings from research into practice, utilizing a framework to reduce health disparities
and promote health equity through: (1) building competency in the above focus areas, (2) building skills in team
science and leading interdisciplinary, diverse research teams; and (3) preparing trainees for productive research
careers. The aLHS-PRE will target outstanding predoctoral candidates who are underrepresented in prevention
research who are currently pursuing doctoral-level clinical training in health professions. We will have a cohort
of five trainees who will pursue an established MS degree in LHS science with a curriculum designed around the
competencies above; trainees will conduct a mentored research project guided by diverse mentoring teams
consisting of experienced and committed subject-matter experts, health system leaders, and “step ahead”
faculty, all of whom are well-grounded in the principles of effective mentoring. Mentors will complete the Clinical
and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Mentor Academy that addresses core mentoring competencies. The
aLHS-PRE will be part of an integrated educational infrastructure at Wake Forest (WF) CTSI that includes a
postdoctoral TL1 program in aLHS; trainees will utilize CTSI resources, attend professional development
seminars, and build networks with other WF T32 trainees. This unique training experience will prepare trainees
for future careers as clinicial prevention scientists leading integration of preventive care in the health system."

Adults with serious and disabling mental illness (SMI) experience a 15-30 year reduced life expectancy

adults with SMI in community-based trials, even among those taking antipsychotic medications; however,
these interventions are rarely sustained once research projects are completed. This later stage translational
study focuses on long-term sustainment of an evidence-based lifestyle intervention (InSHAPE) implemented in
U.S. mental health organizations where integrated health promotion is not necessarily part of the core mission,
but is critical to stem the tide of early mortality in adults with SMI. InSHAPE is the only lifestyle intervention for
adults with SMI that has been tested multiple times with health benefits replicated in two RCTs and a statewide
and national implementation study. There has yet to be an investigation of long-term sustainment of InSHAPE
or any other evidence-based health promotion interventions for adults with SMI in mental health organizations.
From 2014-2019, our team led an NIMH-funded type 3 hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of InSHAPE
in mental health organizations across the U.S. In 2023, 14 (36%) of 39 organizations that completed our prior
implementation study continued to deliver InSHAPE. In the proposed study, we will evaluate long-term
sustainment of InSHAPE (6-8 years post-implementation) on two dimensions: 1) sustained delivery of the
InSHAPE program, and 2) sustained InSHAPE program health benefits. We will leverage data collected in our
prior trial to examine multi-level factors that predict long-term sustainment of InSHAPE at 39 implementation
sites; collect new data on contextual factors, adaptations and fidelity to InSHAPE; and collaborate with an
existing national network of InSHAPE teams to develop a sustainment practice guide tailored for InSHAPE.
While the practice guide will be based on InSHAPE, it will be guided by the Program Sustainability Framework
and thus will include key considerations for sustaining evidence-based health promotion programs more
broadly in mental health organizations. The proposed study has high public health and implementation
science impact as one of the first studies to identify adaptations associated with sustained health promotion
interventions while also addressing longstanding assumptions about the ‘voltage drop’ in individual benefits of
evidence-based interventions as they move from implementation to sustainment. It is highly innovative and
impactful as one of the first studies to use participatory group model building and to leverage a large network of
implementation sites to identify factors, including fidelity and adaptation, that influence long-term sustainment
of an evidence-based health promotion intervention in mental health organizations and to build on these
findings to develop, evaluate, and refine a sustainment practice guide for future research and practice."

Diabetes and obesity in pregnancy cause abnormalities in placental development that underlie adverse
pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, and stillbirth. Central to healthy placental
development is cytotrophoblast differentiation into syncytiotrophoblasts that can be disrupted by diabetes and
obesity by yet unknown mechanisms. Syncytiotrophoblasts facilitate nutrient transport, gas exchange, and
hormone synthesis to support the pregnancy, and their differentiation depends on a highly coordinated
progression of metabolic, epigenetic, and transcriptional reprogramming events. Mitochondrial flux of glucose
and glutamine has emerged as a major factor regulating cellular development, and our initial work shows that
these metabolites play distinctive roles in cellular metabolism and gene expression during trophoblast
differentiation. Glucose primarily fuels citrate and α-ketoglutarate production in rapidly dividing
cytotrophoblasts, while glutamine is the main source in terminally differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts. This shift
is linked to reduced expression of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) in syncytiotrophoblasts, while
mitochondrial glutamine transporter (SLC1A5var) expression remains stable. In this proposal, we will test the
central hypothesis that glucose-derived pyruvate and glutamine flux through the mitochondrial pyruvate
(MPC) and glutamine (SLC1A5var) carriers, respectively, distinctly regulate energetic, epigenetic and
transcriptional reprogramming necessary for trophoblast differentiation. For the proposed experiments, we will
use CRISPR-Cas9 genetic tools to manipulate expression of MPC (Aim 1) or SLC1A5var (Aim 2) in human
trophoblast stem cell (TSC) models. In these lines, we will measure key indices of cellular metabolism using
respirometry and state-of-the-art, high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS)-based
quantitative and 13C stable isotope tracing metabolomics methodologies. Moreover, we will examine genome-
wide and locus-specific histone (H3) acetylation and methylation changes through integrative analysis of
CUT&Tag- and RNAseq datasets. Both biochemical and morphologic differentiation will be characterized in
MPC or SLC1A5var loss of function or overexpressing TSCs. Additionally, in parallel experiments we will
employ inhibitors of MPC and glutaminase in primary human trophoblasts to support key findings in TSCs.
Successful completion of study aims will reveal novel, nutrient-responsive mechanisms controlling epigenetic
and transcriptional reprogramming events that are foundational to trophoblast differentiation. Defining these
fundamental pathways is a necessary first step for developing new, evidence-based approaches that fine-tune
placental fuel use and improve placental development and pregnancy outcomes for women with co-morbid
obesity and diabetes."

Prematurity-related chronic respiratory disease, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), is associated with
high morbidity, healthcare use, and expenditures. Inflammation in early life increases the risk of BPD develop-
ment, but the innate immune mechanisms behind this are poorly understood. Inflammatory stress induces the
expression of ligands for the activating receptor natural-killer group 2, member D (NKG2D), in diverse target cell
populations. NKG2D is a C-type lectin-like receptor, expressed by γδ T cells, NK cells, and other lymphocytes
that are enriched in fetal lungs. Ligand engagement and activation of NKG2D+ lymphocytes enhance inflamma-
tion and induce cytotoxicity. The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms by which pulmonary
inflammation in early life induces NKG2D ligand expression on target cells and activates NKG2D+ lung lympho-
cytes (γδ T cells and NK cells), and how this in turn leads to BPD-like lung immunopathology. The hypothesis is
that early-life exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or hyperoxia up-regulates the expression of NKG2D
ligands (NKG2DLs) that engage and activate lung NKG2D+ lymphocytes leading to pulmonary inflammation,
cytotoxicity, and that in turn impairs alveolar and vascular development. Studies have implicated activated lym-
phocytes and γδ T cells, as well as IL-17A and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, as key drivers of inflammation
in preterm infants. Cytotoxic Granzyme B (GzmB)+ NKG2D+ cells and CD68+ macrophages that express the
human NKG2D ligands MHC class-I-related protein A (MICA) and MICB were found using tracheal aspirates of
premature infants who are mechanically ventilated in the first week of life and later develop BPD. Also, aspirate
MICA mRNA levels positively correlate with median FiO2. To investigate the contribution of lung lymphocytes
and NKG2DL-NKG2D signaling to lung inflammation, this team used a mouse model of BPD with chronic early-
life exposure to LPS. LPS increased IL-17a and GzmB expression in lung NKG2D+ γδ T cells and, to a lesser
extent, in NK cells. NKG2D blockade attenuated the effects of LPS on NKG2D+ γδ T cells, pro-inflammatory
cytokine and cytotoxic responses, and preserved alveolar growth. LPS also induced cellular stress pathways
and increased the expression of NKG2DLs (retinoic acid early transcript 1 (Rae-1) and murine UL16-binding
protein-like transcript 1 (MULT1)) in lung macrophages and epithelial cells. Rae-1 blockade attenuated LPS-
induced lung immunopathology. In a second BPD model, neonatal hyperoxia induced similar responses. These
findings point to a role for activated NKG2D+ lung lymphocytes and NKG2DLs as key inflammatory mediators in
BPD pathogenesis. The aims of this proposal are: 1. Map the cell fate and define the role of NKG2D+ lympho-
cytes (γδ T cells and NK cells) in early-life LPS- and hyperoxia-induced lung immunopathology. 2. Determine
the cellular sources for NKG2DLs and define the immunogenicity and regenerative potential of ligand-expressing
cells in neonatal LPS- and hyperoxia-induced lung immunopathology. These studies will significantly impact the
mechanistic understanding of the inflammatory pathways that lead to chronic lung disease in preterm infants."
10977815,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although older women derive a similar degree of benefit from breast cancer survivorship
guidelines as their younger counter-parts, there are other issues such as multiple medical
comorbidities and unique care needs that may impact survivorship outcomes. The frequent
interactions with the health system and clinician visits, negotiating conflicting information about
symptoms and treatments, adapting recommendations into daily routines, managing
medications can increase the treatment burden experienced by older women with breast
cancer. Currently, there are no available approaches to guide patients in considering the
complexity of shifting from managing a potentially life-limiting disease to managing multiple
chronic conditions along with cancer survivorship needs. The literature supports that when older
women with breast cancer learn about their healthcare priorities, they engage more in the
treatment decision-making process. In the proposed project, I will use a Patient Priorities Care
framework to explore older breast cancer survivors' priorities and health care preferences for
high-quality breast cancer survivorship. The framework will include two components: (1) a
health priorities identification session with a facilitator, and (2) an encounter with the oncology
provider to discuss changes in the patient's care plan to align it with his/her priorities. My overall
hypothesis is that prioritizing patients' priorities is feasible and facilitates individualized
survivorship care for older women with breast cancer and multiple chronic conditions. An
advisory panel composed of oncologists, geriatricians, and patient advocates will provide
regular feedback throughout the refinement and adaptation of the Patient Priorities Care
framework to the breast cancer survivorship context and engage in an iterative process of
development. After incorporating feedback from the advisory panel to create an adapted version
of the framework, we will carry out a quasi-experimental pilot study with the objective of
evaluating the feasibility of using the framework in the Oncology clinic and provide empirical
estimates of treatment effect sizes by measuring treatment burden and quality of life at 3
months, adherence to basic and priorities driven survivorship care recommendations at 12
months. Ultimately, the results of this project will provide initial direction of intended
improvement which will be verified in a larger powered future trial. Furthermore, through my
work on this project and the proposed training activities, I will strengthen my skill-set in decision-
making, qualitative/mixed-methods methodology and clinical trial design which will allow me to
transition to my long-term goal of becoming an established independent investigator."

Since the beginning of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, we have seen a number of prominent variants, and
two of them are very recent. COVID-19 continues to affect millions of people: over 771 million people were
affected and over 6.9 million deaths occurred (as of October 2023). A significant portion of patients who suffer
from severe COVID-19 disease are at risk for developing long-term Post-Acute Sequelae (PASC) with pulmonary
fibrosis. Identifying patients who are most at risk for post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis could allow early
intervention with anti-fibrotic drugs and other potential treatment strategies. Given the extent of people infected
with COVID-19, post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, yet there is
no strategy developed to address this unmet critical clinical need. Hence, the overall goal of this proposal is to
address this need for predicting post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis at an early stage by developing novel
explainable deep learning (DL) algorithms on multimodal data (combined imaging and electronic health record
(EHR) data) from multiple centers. Main Hypothesis: The proposed explainable DL algorithms will identify
patients at risk for development of post COVID-19 related pulmonary fibrosis at early phases by multimodal data
with high accuracy. In Aim 1, we will identify imaging and EHR characteristics associated with post COVID-19
fibrosis from patient data gathered from Northwestern, Columbia, NIH, and UPenn. We will automatically extract
imaging (CT scan) features in two ways: (i) pulmonary analysis (PA) and (ii) body composition analysis (BCA).
For each patient, we will collect EHR data consisting of demographic, clinical (including vital, medication,
vaccination, and comorbidity) and laboratory information. We expect to retrospectively collect a balanced dataset
of 1,150 initial CT scans and associated EHR data. In Aim 2, we will develop Transformer embedded explainable
capsule networks (X-TCaps) for prediction of post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. We will integrate our newly
established visual explanation algorithm (called IBA) into the machine-generated results in addition to
radiographical explanations, and PA and BCA features captured by X-TCaps. In Aim 3, we will employ our
established optimal biomarker (OBM) method to determine the most potent features (biomarkers) from EHR and
imaging data to predict post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis at the highest accuracy possible. PASC is a massive
emergency and very little is known about it. Once accomplished, our proposed framework will provide early
prediction of post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis and determine biomarkers to understand pulmonary fibrosis
better. Our study is innovative as no previous study has investigated post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, which
is paramount to developing a robust knowledge database and informing clinical practice in this area. With this
project, we will provide mechanistic understanding of post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis, which is central in
determining therapeutic options and will ultimately play a role in lung transplant considerations in the long term."

 Cancer immunotherapies have achieved unprecedented clinical responses and are revolutionizing cancer
treatments. Despite of the tremendous success of cancer immunotherapies, it remains unclear why only a subset
of individuals responds to treatment and how to turn non-responders to become responsive. Receptor-interacting
protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) regulates cell fate and proinflammatory signaling downstream of multiple innate immune
pathways, including those initiated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), toll-like receptor ligands, and interferons.
In TNF-α signaling, the kinase activity of RIPK1 is required for inducing apoptosis and necroptosis. RIPK1 also
serves as a kinase-independent scaffolding protein to recruit the NF-κB activation complex, leading to activation
of the NF-κB pathway and cell survival. Interestingly, mice with a kinase-dead Ripk1 mutation (mimicking
inhibitors) and with Ripk1 knockout (mimicking degraders) showed completely different phenotypes. Recently,
our work, along with two other independent studies, showed that knockout of RIPK1 in cancer cells
significantly sensitized tumors to anti-PD1, leading to favorable changes in the tumor microenvironment.
Homozygous loss-of-function RIPK1 mutations are well tolerated in humans. Patients with complete loss of
RIPK1 protein only showed symptoms confined to the immune system with primary immunodeficiency and/or
intestinal inflammation, suggesting that pharmacological RIPK1 degradation can be potentially safe and tolerable,
especially with transient intervention in clinical settings. Leveraging the Proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)
technology, we developed a first-in-class RIPK1 degrader LD4172. In our preliminary study, we showed that
LD4172 potently degrades RIPK1 protein in a panel of human cancer cell lines and inhibits NF-κB activities. The
degradation specificity of LD4172 was confirmed with proteomics profiling. In a mouse melanoma
immunocompetent model, LD4172 significantly synergized with anti-PD1. In this project, we will continue our
medicinal chemistry campaign to develop an orally available RIPK1 degrader and test its efficacy in a panel of
preclinical models with different immune subtypes. Successful completion of this project will lead to the
development of not only a chemical probe to interrogate RIPK1 related biology but also a highly promising
therapeutic agent to advance cancer immunotherapies. We strive to use diverse preclinical models to test the
RIPK1 degrader to identify biomarkers, which is very important to identify responsive patients in future clinical
translations."
10998115,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The opioid epidemic in the United States has reached critical proportions, with opioid-related overdoses
contributing to more than 75% of drug overdose deaths. This crisis not only leads to significant mortality rates
but also poses a significant economic burden on society. Despite the prevalence of opioid use disorders (OUD),
the available treatment options remain limited, with only 3 FDA-approved medications, and there is a critical
need to develop novel therapeutics. One way to develop novel treatments is by examining endogenous factors
that modulate opioid responses such as galanin, a neuropeptide that is known to oppose opioid reward. Galanin
signals through three G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) including GalR1, which preferentially forms
heteromers with µ-opioid receptors (MOR) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key node in the mesolimbic
reward system. Recent literature indicates that galanin blocks MOR-mediated dopamine release in the VTA via
GalR1-MOR heteromer interactions. Recently, our lab found that intra-VTA galanin administration attenuates
morphine conditioned place preference (CPP) in male and female mice, identifying a neuroanatomical substrate
for galanin action in opioid reward. However, the mechanisms underlying galanin’s ability to attenuate morphine
CPP are not clear. Thus, the proposed experiments were designed with 2 key goals: 1) identify the source of
endogenous galanin in the VTA that opposes opioid signaling, and 2) determine the role of the GalR1-MOR
heteromer in the VTA in opioid reward. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that galanin from the lateral
hypothalamus (LH) signals through GalR1-MOR heteromers on GABAergic projections from the rostromedial
tegmental nucleus (RMTg) within the VTA to oppose morphine CPP. A combination of behavioral, molecular,
pharmacological, and genetic tools will be used to test this hypothesis in male and female mice. In Aim 1, I will
use retrograde viral-assisted tracing and RNAscope in situ hybridization to determine all endogenous sources of
galanin to the VTA. Then, I will ablate galanin in the LH, which we know contains galaninergic projections to the
VTA and modulates opioid reward, by locally infusing Cre-expressing virus into the LH of floxed galanin
conditional knockout mice and quantify the density of the galanin-positive fibers in the VTA. Additionally,
morphine CPP will determine the consequences of removing LH galanin inputs to the VTA on opioid reward. In
Aim 2, a validated GalR1-MOR heteromer interfering peptide will be co-infused with galanin into the VTA to
determine whether local heteromer signaling is necessary for galanin to attenuate morphine CPP. Conversely, a
novel viral construct will be used to overexpress GalR1 selectively in MOR-containing GABAergic neurons of the
RMTg. Together, these experiments will provide crucial information regarding the role of galanin in opioid reward
and have the potential to identify the GalR1-MOR heteromer as a novel therapeutic target in OUD. These
experiments support the mission of NIDA to advance science on drug use and addiction and promote my
development into an independent scientist who will continue to pursue this mission throughout my career."

Adolescents living with HIV-1, many of whom began antiretroviral treatment (ART) in early life,
are an ideal group to benefit from novel HIV-1 treatment approaches and curative strategies.
However, a better understanding of HIV-1 persistence into adolescence following continuous ART

propose to develop and get trained on laboratory techniques and next generation sequencing
techniques to advance an HIV-1 cure research program in Botswana with specific aims to 1) first
identify adolescents with low reservoir without detectable intact virus (Type I controllers) or those
with a blocked and locked reservoir profile (with detectable intact proviruses with non-genic
chromosomal integration (Type II controllers) from a cohort of adolescents who were perinatally
infected with HIV-1 and having been on ART since the first 2 years of life. 2) Evaluate how the
reservoir changes over time in the same adolescent cohort living with HIV-1C while for those with
‘blocked and locked’ reservoir profile, if they agree, I will enroll them into the Tatelo Plus ATI study
(U01AI179561) to test the hypothesis that those with a ‘blocked and locked’ reservoir profile (Type
II) may be post-treatment controllers and evaluate how their reservoir evolves pre and post ATI;
and 3) identify biomarkers associated with the potential for Type I or Type II control. I am originally
from Botswana and I hold a PhD in Immunology and Virology, Master’s degree in Immunology,
and a Bachelor’s degree in Medical Microbiology. I completed my postdoctoral fellowship at
Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and the Ragon Institute in 2022 and have now returned
to my home country Botswana, where I am in the process of setting up an adolescent HIV-1 cure
research program and planning to become an independent investigator at the Botswana Harvard

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the deadliest cancer, and novel therapeutic strategies are
needed to improve treatment outcomes of patients with this disease. FTY720 (Fingolimod/Gilenya, Novartis) is
a sphingosine analog drug approved for the treatment of refractory multiple sclerosis due to its immune
suppressor function. Immune suppression by FTY720 requires its phosphorylation (P-FTY720) mainly by
sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2). However, pro-drug FTY720, without its phosphorylation, exhibits anti-cancer
functions in various models, including NSCLC. Our published and unpublished preliminary studies
demonstrated that FTY720, and not P-FTY720, directly binds and targets cytoplasmic SET oncoprotein, which
is overexpressed in majority of NSCLC cells and tumors. Cytoplasmic SET is a known inhibitor of protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A). FTY720-SET binding prevents inhibitory SET-PP2A association, leading to the
activation of tumor suppressor PP2A. Mechanistically, activation of PP2A by FTY720 induces necroptosis and
cell death in NSCLC cells in culture and in animal models through the formation of RIPK1-C16-ceramide-non-
muscle myosin IIA (NMIIA) enriched pores (we coined the name “ceramidosomes”) at the plasma membrane.
Thus, we designed this application to test the novel hypothesis that FTY720 and its functional mimetics
mediate NSCLC cell death and tumor suppression, at least in part, by directly binding and targeting SET
oncoprotein, resulting in the generation of plasma membrane pores and necroptosis. There are three Specific
Aims proposed in this application: Aim 1) Define the mechanism by which FTY720 mediates necroptosis via
induction of ceramidosomes. Aim 2) Identify how FTY720-induced ceramidosomes are activated by PP2A to
mediate necroptosis. Aim 3) Determine the therapeutic and clinical significance of targeting SET by FTY720
and its functional mimetics, like A7-2, to mediate PP2A-dependent ceramidosome activation and NSCLC tumor
suppression. These studies will help define how targeting SET induces necroptosis using molecular, genetic,
pharmacologic, and structural tools, including X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. Moreover, data obtained
from this proposal will help predict which of the NSCLC patients are likely to benefit from the treatment with
FTY720 and its analog drugs. We will also utilize functional mimetics of FTY720, such as A7-2, which is a
recently developed analog that inhibits SET and induces necroptosis at nanomolar concentrations, in the
absence/presence of mutant (G12C)-K-Ras inhibitors, such as sotorasib or adagrasib, to suppress NSCLC
tumor growth/progression. Thus, these studies will provide first-in-class treatment options and precision
therapy for the treatment of patients with refractory NSCLC."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and
abnormalities preceding overt CVD (left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction) are more prevalent in T1D
as early as childhood. Disparities in CVD and its risk factors within T1D according to the social construct of
race/ethnicity are concerning, especially given rising incidence of T1D specifically in non-Hispanic Black (NHB)
and Hispanic youth. Such youth are more likely to have elevated weight, blood pressure, lipids, and glycemia
than non-Hispanic White (NHW) youth from T1D diagnosis onward, and NHB individuals experience twice the
CVD mortality and 8 times the CVD event rate as NHW peers. Prior studies of CVD within T1D focused on NHW
participants with ≥25 years T1D duration treated in an earlier clinical environment, and therefore do not reflect
today’s increasingly diverse T1D population with ostensible access to modern diabetes technologies and
subspecialty care networks. We and others have reported that social determinants of health (SDOH), including
socio-economic factors (low income, limited parental education, food insecurity), inadequate health behaviors
(unhealthy diet, physical activity and sleep patterns, smoking), and healthcare access barriers (lack of, or limited,
health insurance, high out-of-pocket costs), are associated with lower quality of T1D care and worse T1D
outcomes. The impact of SDOH on CVD risk factors and subclinical abnormalities within diverse T1D populations
is not known, yet critical for informing multi-level CVD prevention strategies for T1D. We propose to investigate
whether SDOH-related barriers may account for racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk factor trajectories from
diagnosis onward and subclinical abnormalities in early adulthood. We will enroll 1000 participants from the
SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study, including 300 Hispanic or NHB young adults. We will rigorously investigate
racial/ethnic differences in prevalence of subclinical CVD in early adulthood (mean age 25 years, T1D duration
16 years) via new assessments of structural and functional abnormalities of the heart and vascular system (with
echocardiography, carotid ultrasonography, vascular tonometry). Longitudinal modeling of CVD risk factor
trajectories (weight, lipids, blood pressure, A1c, albuminuria, autonomic function), SDOH factors (as defined by
Health People 2030) collected from diagnosis onward will enable us to understand how and which SDOH barriers
account for racial/ethnic differences in CVD outcomes within T1D. Our aims are 1) To quantify racial/ethnic
disparities in trajectories of CVD risk factors, and in subclinical cardiac and vascular outcomes during early
adulthood among SEARCH participants with youth-onset T1D.; 2) To understand which SDOH-related barriers
are associated with CVD risk factor trajectories and subclinical cardiac and vascular outcomes, using mixed
methods; and 3) To determine if specific SDOH-related domains (identified in Aim 2) explain racial/ethnic
inequities in CVD risk factors and subclinical cardiac and vascular outcomes."
10998911,"Over the past several decades, and accelerating in recent years, the sarcomere has been
appreciated as both the hotspot for cardiomyopathy-causing variants and as a promising drug target.
These variants can alter the structure and regulation of the sarcomere, leading to altered function.
The field has made significant progress in understanding these effects using various models and
while each of these have strengths, they all have caveats that limit their utility in understanding the in
vivo impact of cardiomyopathy-inducing variants. The porcine heart, the most accurate animal model
of human hearts, has similar isoform composition, structure, heart rate, and response to physiological
stimuli, allowing studies on live muscle that are not feasible with biobanked human samples. Our
research team is uniquely suited for the sophisticated experiments necessary to perform these
studies. To interrogate the structural impact of these variants, we will use synchrotron X-ray
diffraction, the only technique capable of obtaining molecular level sarcomere structural data from live
cardiac muscle. Sarcomere function will be assessed both at Argonne and at nearby Loyola
University Chicago on custom biophysical setups. Lastly, sarcomere structure and function are
regulated by protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and isoform switching, which will be
assessed using our top-of-the-line mass spectrometry instrumentation. We will investigate the
structural basis of myofilament functional dysregulation in healthy, hypertrophic (HCM: MYH7R403Q,
MYBPC330X), dilated (DCM: TTN16648X, RBM20R636S) cardiomyopathy transgenic pigs across the
following three aims. These studies will reveal the underlying structural basis for cardiomyopathies
resulting from sarcomere protein variants, revealing translational mechanistic understanding
necessary to treat these diseases. In Aim 1 we will determine the impact of HCM and DCM mutations
on normal sarcomere structure. We will collect X-ray diffraction patterns and functional data from live
porcine cardiac muscle to investigate the structural basis of protein variants leading to HCM and
DCM. In Aim 2 we will determine the impact of physiological inotropic interventions in HCM and
DCM. A major pathological mechanism of these disease-causing variants is that they modify the
sarcomere’s ability to respond appropriately to normal physiological conditions. Here we will assess
the response to conditions which typically elicit an ionotropic response. In Aim 3 we will determine
how HCM and DCM mutations affect sarcomere function regulation by post-translational
modifications."

We have shown that elective nodal irradiation (ENI) blunts systemic immunity in preclinical models of head and
neck cancer (HNC), but without it, the risk of regional recurrence in the lymph nodes (LN) is high. Data from
clinical trials showed that omission of ENI is feasible, but nodal progression or recurrence does vary by the
choice of immunotherapy (IO) that is combined with the radiation (RT). Our previous trial showed that
combination aPDL1 (Durvalumab) with tumor-only RT resulted in exceptional high pathological and clinical
response rates and no nodal recurrences. However, in two other separate trials, when either another a-
PDL1(Atezolizumab) or a-CTLA4 was added to Durvalumab-RT, it resulted in high rates of nodal recurrence
leading to trial closures. This suggests that target cell activation or inhibition varies by the type of IO or
combination IO used in the context of RT and dictates nodal outcome. Our preliminary data show that trial
patient progressive nodes contained a high percentage of Tregs and, preclinically, genetic knockout of PD1 on
Tregs increases their activation, which we have previously shown to be driven by STAT3. We demonstrate that
nodal metastasis can be prevented by early depletion of Tregs prior to tumor implantation. This is accompanied
by enhanced morphological maturation of high endothelial venules (HEVs), specialized postcapillary venules
whose function within DLNs has been correlated with immune trafficking and activation. Localized within
perivascular niches, and surrounded by Tregs and cancer cells, these HEVs, which express LTBR, are
decreased in numbers and maturation on nodal recurrence, a phenomenon that is reversed by LTBR agonists.
We also show that ST2 Tregs, a specific Tregs subset, are upregulated with RT and that genetic knockout of
ST2 on Tregs results in marked tumor regression. Recombinant administration of IL33 (ST2's ligand), on the
other hand, combined with RT and Treg depletion, leads to high rates of eradication of nodal recurrence. We
hypothesize that activation of PD1 expressing Tregs in the RT-IO setting contributes to cancer immune
evasion directly via STAT3 pathway activation, indirectly through LTA1B2-LTBR Treg-HEV interaction,
thereby limiting the Teff infiltration into the nodal environment, and through the ST2-IL33 Treg-stromal
interaction, abrogating Teff cells' expansion potential. In Aim1, we will examine the mechanistic impact of
immune check point inhibition on Tregs; in Aim2, we will test how Treg-HEV interaction facilitates a tumor-
promoting environment within the LN, leading to immunosuppression and cancer cell immune evasion; and in
Aim 3, we will determine how ST2 expressing Tregs modulate tumor immune microenvironment in nodal
progression. These will be tested using genetically engineered mouse models, multicompartmental mass
cytometry, scRNA seq, metabolomic and proteomic analysis, and multispectral immunofluorescence preclinically
and in clinical trial specimens from those with and without nodal failure. These studies will collectively elucidate
mechanisms of nodal progression with profound impact for therapeutic discovery."

Clinical virology is predicated on the workflow of analyzing small sample volumes (to minimize patient discomfort,
storage, and fit legacy infrastructure) for a single analyte, i.e., virus, with utmost precision. The human virome
project (HVP) does not share these restrictions. The HVP priority tissues of urine, stool, saliva, and blood can
be acquired from healthy people in a 50 – 500 ml sample size. For instance, the Red Cross makes normal
plasma available in 500 ml bags, and NGS allows for the characterization of all human viruses in a single
reaction. This proposal responds to RFA-RM-23-018 with the development of two novel tools: AIM 1, a virus
purification pipeline that utilizes larger volumes to achieve < 1 genome copy/ ml sensitivity; AIM 2, a single virion
detection pipeline to provide an accurate denominator of how many intact virions a given NGS sequence set is
representing. We hypothesize that Viral Direct Counts (VDC) akin to bacterial direct counts will become the
essential parameter for integrating the studies in the HVP."
10989045,"Epilepsy is the third most prevalent neurological disorder after stroke and Alzheimer’s Disease with an incidence
of 1 in 26 individuals. It is estimated that 3 million people in the U.S and 65 million worldwide currently live with
epilepsy. Approximately 30% of epilepsy patients are drug resistant and this number has remained the same
since 1850 despite the marketing of 12 new antiseizure drugs in the past 20 years. A major hurdle to
understanding the disease is that seizures are transient and importantly, difficult to predict. This prevents the
acquisition of a detailed portrait of molecular, cellular and circuit alterations at the most critical time: just before
seizure onset. However, seizures manifest a clear temporal organization: they display circadian and multi day
(mulitdien) rhythmicity in patients, regardless of epilepsy type or affected brain region. Combining circadian and
multidien rhythms, one can extract high seizure risk (HiSR) and low seizure risk (LoSR) epochs in a patient-
specific manner. Importantly, this cyclicity in risk exists in two rat models of epilepsy and canine epilepsy. The
existence of HiSR and LoSR times imply that circuit excitability changes in a periodic manner that can be
modelled and predicted, and its mechanisms studied. We have developed a machine learning tool that acquires
continuous EEG over many weeks, learns the pattern of interictal activity and then predicts when an animal is
entering a LoSR or HiSR epoch. The goal of this application is to embark on the first ever global molecular
and cellular exploration of HiSR and LoSR epochs. Historically, a common research strategy has been to
compare non-epileptic to epileptic brains and, clearly this approach has yielded a wealth of knowledge regarding
mechanisms behind seizure genesis and epileptogenesis. The premise of our application is that epileptic and
non-epileptic brains are different enough from each other that additional, unique insights will be uncovered by
using LoSR epochs as controls for HiSR epochs. Preliminary data from bulk tissue shows a differential
expression of nearly 100 hippocampal proteins between HiSR and LoSR times. Together, these findings inform
our central hypothesis that large scale hippocampal gene changes, driven by a few Master regulators,
contribute to alterations in seizure risk over the multidien cycle. We will perform single cell RNAseq on
hippocampi from rats in LoSR and HiSR to generate a high resolution, single cell map of all gene changes that
occur as a brain transitions from a low to high seizure risk state.
To the best of our knowledge this will be the first ever study comparing molecular and electrophysiological
changes at the single cell level in the epileptic brain as it transitions from a low to a high seizure risk state. Using
bioinformatic tools developed and published by us, we will identify potential Master Regulators behind these
changes in every cell type and subfield of the rat hippocampus. The major deliverable of the proposal will be a
detailed cell type specific transcriptome map accompanied by a survey of network properties during HiSR and
LoSR epochs"

Fast rounds of host cell invasion and intracellular replication are responsible for tissue lesions caused by the
tachyzoite form of the opportunistic human parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Underlying the lytic cycle is a
parasite-specific replication mechanism, which forms two new daughter cells in the cytosol of the mother
(endodyogeny). The process is fundamentally different from cell division of the host and relies on a
specialized cytoskeleton, called Inner Membrane Complex (IMC), which is deposited on 22 subpellicular
microtubules (SPMTs). This unique cytoskeleton is involved in all aspects of the lytic cycle and acts as an
essential scaffold during the division process. The current working model suggests SPMTs nucleate from the
apical polar ring (APR), a presumed secondary microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) in the parasite.
However, very limited experimental data exists that corroborates this. Furthermore, how SPMTs connect to
the APR early in division is also unknown. Several factors have recently been identified that facilitate the
association of SPMTs and APR later in the budding cycle, but phenotypic consequences of protein depletion
indicate that none impact the early division steps. This indicates that currently the early events of parasite
budding are incompletely understood.
To fill this void, we started to interrogate the budding cycle using iterative expansion microscopy (ExM) and
identified an intriguing five-fold assembly of the nascent SPMTs (nSPMTs) at the onset of division. Our data
indicate that nSPMTs are organized into five “sheets” –consisting of approximately four individual nSPMTs–
grouped around the nascent APR. This suggests that nucleation unfolds in distinct areas and a separate
event, later in budding, arranges the even spacing of SPMTs around the APR as seen in mature parasites.
To probe further into the nucleation mechanism we localized γ-Tubulin to the forming APR, specifically at the
onset of division. Its presence there is short-lived, indicating a function specifically tailored to the early
daughter scaffold.
We hypothesize that γ-Tubulin and its associated complex (γ-TuC) play a pivotal role in the early stages of
division. We will test this under two specific Aims. Aim 1 will establish the budding-related functions of γ-TuC.
We will study this by conditional depletion of γ-TuC components in combination with iterative ExM. Under
Aim 2 we will employ reciprocal proximity biotinylation in combination with chemical perturbation to
specifically reveal the molecular make-up of γ-TuC at the forming cytoskeleton. This will allow us to gain a
more complete understanding of its molecular functions. Together, our findings will establish the role of γ-
TuC in parasite budding, which may also be relevant for other apicomplexan parasites equipped with a similar
cytoskeleton."

 Networks of branched actin filaments produce forces necessary for cellular processes ranging from cell
migration to endocytosis. These branches are formed by proteins actin-related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex,
along with proteins that promote Arp2/3 activation. Cortactin is a multi-functional protein that can activate
Arp2/3 complex on its own at high concentrations, synergize with certain nucleation promoting factors, or
stabilize branches after they are formed. This multifunctionality has made isolating the role of cortactin as a
branch stabilizer difficult. Actin branches are intrinsically stable, so why cortactin-mediated branch stabilization
is important for regulating force-producing actin networks is unknown. One possibility is that cortactin protects
branches from being removed by a class of debranching proteins, such as coronin 1B or glia maturation factor-
γ. Additionally, actin networks are age-segregated, with newer branches near the surface being thought to be
more important in the ability of the network to provide pushing forces, so the importance of cortactin may be
related to whether debranchers target the younger or older regions of the network. In this proposal, we will
utilize a reconstituted assay to isolate cortactin's role as a branch stabilizer, and determine whether it is
important for force production by preventing branches from being removed prematurely in Aim 1. Neural
Wiskott-Aldritch syndrome protein will be used as a nucleation promoting factor, because our lab has
previously shown does not synergize with cortactin. Lower concentrations of cortactin will minimize cortactin-
mediated branch nucleation. Bead motility assays will allow for observing force production by age-segregated
actin networks that push against beads in the presence of cortactin alone and with differentially targeted
debranching proteins. In doing so, we will determine how the interplay between branch stabilization and
destabilization affects the ability of actin networks to provide pushing forces. Many debranchers have also
been implicated in bundling actin, so cryo-electron tomography will identify whether actin branches dissociate
or remodel as bundles. Then, in Aim 2, we will assess how these proteins affect the recycling of monomeric
actin from branched actin networks. By incorporating the filamentous actin disassembly protein, cofilin, into the
bead motility assay, we will assess whether the interplay between cortactin and debranching proteins on
sustaining bead motility over longer periods of time, which will be verified by an actin co-precipitation assay
and cryo-electron tomography. Finally, in Aim 3, we will characterize the activity of a more enigmatic
debrancher, coronin 7. In addition to the bead motility assay to identify the role of coronin 7 on force production
by branched actin networks, we will utilize total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to observe the
frequency of debranching in the presence of coronin 7 with or without cortactin. We will then observe binding
and dissociation of fluorescently labeled coronin 7 to actin filaments made from ATP (newer branches) or ADP
(older branches) to assess nucleotide preference."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a disease that results from relative pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, and affects >400
million people. We (Rutter) previously identified functional β-cell subsets based upon analysis of real-time Ca2+
responses and cell-cell connectivity. A “βLEADER” population (~5% of β-cells) exhibits fast and robust Ca2+ influx
that controls the timing of islet-wide glucose responses, and a separate population of highly interconnected βHUB
-cells (5-10% of β-cells) that synchronizes glucose responses, islet-wide. More recently, we (Pospisilik)
discovered that H3K27me3 dosage is a novel regulator of β-cell lineage differentiation, stability, and functional
specification. We identified two epigenetically distinct β-cell populations (βHI and βLO) that are conserved across
mice and humans and comprise >90% of the β-cell compartment. They are distinguished by distinct nuclear and
cell surface protein expression, by distinct epigenomes and transcriptomes, and by a series of morphological
and functional differences. Importantly, βHI and βLO cells can be purified by FACS, and their relative ratios are
altered in mouse models and human T2D. Our preliminary data now suggest that βLEADER and βHUB cells together
comprise the epigenetically-defined βHI cells, and that βFOLLOWER cells are synonymous with βLO cells. The
objective of this project is to test this hypothesis, and define the functional and disease relevance of these
putative β-cell subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use novel single-cell epigenomic tools to determine the extent to which
functionally- and epigenetically-defined β-cell subsets are the same. In Aim 2, we will use conditional deletion
mouse models to determine when and how H3K27me3 levels control the emergence of each β-cell subset, and
their relative ratios. In Aim 3, we will use the same mouse models to determine if and how β-cell subtype ratios
relate to obesity-associated diabetes, and if subtype proportions can be reversed by diet, SGLT2i, or GLP1R
agonist treatments. We will perform parallel studies in human SC-islets to determine if HNF1A mutants (a causal
T2D genetic variant) alter β-cell subtype ratio and function, and if those effects are reversible. Finally, we will
screen biobanked nPOD and ADI pancreatic samples for the relative proportions of these functional subsets
across metabolic diseases. Thus, Aim 3 will establish the extent and impact of subtype-specific β-cell dysfunction
in T2D. By using this unified theoretical and experimental framework, we will establish an epigenetic basis for
understanding and manipulating putative β-cell subtype number and function in vitro and in vivo, and novel
methods for generating SC-islets with preferential skews in β-cell subtypes."

Skeletal muscle exemplifies structure-function relationships in biology. The organization of sarcomeres follow
hierarchical ordering to form long contractile cells, bundled in extra-cellular matrix, to form larger fascicles and
ultimately whole muscles. The tight relationship between structure and function allows muscle performance
(and disease) to be inferred from its microstructure. For example, fiber area is directly related to isometric force
production in muscle. With injury, microstructural changes in muscle fiber area (size), fibrosis (accumulation of
extracellular matrix), membrane damage (permeability), and inflammation (edema) are observed, and impair
muscle function. Muscle biopsy, followed by microscopic examination of the tissue (histology), is the gold
standard to diagnose and monitor muscle health and disease. This tool is invasive, requiring a large bore
needle and tissue removal under sterile conditions, which makes it painful and costly. Therefore, biopsy is not
conducive to serial monitoring of muscle health. It is also semi-quantitative, and often difficult to extrapolate to
the entire muscle, limiting its scientific and clinical value. For these reasons, there is a need for noninvasive
assessment of muscle microstructure, which would facilitate the quantitative examination of muscle injury over
time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to noninvasively quantify changes in volume, fat
distribution, and water content in muscle. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a version of MRI that measures anisotropic
diffusion of water, which is related to tissue microstructure. Many studies have used dMRI to measure
restricted diffusion in injured skeletal muscle and have theorized how microstructure relates to diffusion.
However, these relationships are not explicitly tested nor carefully validated because the necessary
experiments are complicated and difficult to rigorously control. To address this gap in knowledge, the purpose
of this proposal is to define the relationship between restricted diffusion and muscle microstructure assessed
with classic and innovative new dMRI techniques. Our central hypothesis is that dMRI measurements can be
optimized to detect small but clinically relevant changes in muscle microstructure. Aim #1 will investigate a new
dMRI pulse sequence and analysis technique that has enhanced sensitivity to muscle microstructure using
previously established computer simulation and 3D precision engineered models. In Aim #2, we will utilize
animal models of clinically meaningful muscle injuries to evaluate sensitivity of common, less common, and
novel dMRI pulse sequences to detecting microstructural differences between models. In Aim #3, we will utilize
a multiparametric MRI protocol to assess diagnostic, prognostic, and functional changes associated with a
clinically relevant animal model of muscular dystrophy. These experiments will elucidate the relationships
between microstructure and diffusion in muscle. The long-term goal is to non-invasively, serially quantify
muscle microstructure. This approach is innovative in that it combines state-of-the art imaging, simulation,
nanofabrication, and physiology approaches to develop a clinically meaningful measurement tool."

T cell development, activation, and differentiation are all dependent on TCR signaling, along with
important contributions from costimulatory and cytokine receptor pathways. Many lines of
evidence indicate that variations in TCR signal strength have a major impact on the outcome of
these processes. For mature CD8 T cells, TCR signal strength determines proliferative capacity
and effector versus memory potential following infection. We assert that there is a growing need
to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the pathways regulating distinct T cell
functions and differentiation processes. Moreover, manipulation of T cell responses underlies
many therapeutic strategies currently in practice and under development. As this field has
progressed, it has become clear there is a need for more nuanced manipulation of T cell signaling
pathways. To achieve clinical efficacy, we need to understand how to tune T cell responses.
The field presently lacks an understanding of how differences in TCR stimulation strength produce
distinct gene expression patterns that steer T cell responses. We now have a body of data
supporting a key role for the TEC kinase ITK in tuning T-cell signaling. ITK is not required for all
TCR signaling; instead, in its absence, TCR signaling is significantly reduced. From these studies,
the clear function of ITK has been difficult to discern, as some aspects of T cell activation
appeared normal in the absence of ITK, whereas other T cell functions were greatly impaired. Our
data now provide a framework to understand these apparent discrepancies, and suggest that
variations in antigen density and in TCR affinity dictate the magnitude of ITK activity modulating
subsequent gene expression responses.
This proposal will study the contribution of specific ITK activation mechanisms (Aim 1) and
costimulatory interactions (Aim 2) to understand how ITK mediates tunable responses to TCR
stimulation. Biochemical and structural biology insights are directly transferred into primary T cell
experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanisms controlling ITK regulation. We will also study
the role of ITK regulation in human disease (Aim 3). Genetic mutations that activate ITK have
been recently identified in patients with autoimmunity and there is evidence that the ITK-SYK
fusion tyrosine kinase interacts with normal ITK in promoting oncogenesis in peripheral T cell
lymphomas. The results of these studies will provide us with critical information about the nature
of ITK regulation and how ITK activity influences T cell activation in response to TCR signal
strength."

Candida albicans is a eukaryotic component of mammalian gut microbiota, where it exists in a
commensal state, both benefitting from and acting upon the host environment without causing
symptoms. C. albicans is also the most common cause of fungal infectious disease, which occurs upon
overgrowth and escape to ectopic sites. Existing research on commensalism has largely ignored
eukaryotes and is devoid of mechanistic detail. It is unknown how pathobiont commensals establish
their niches, or what determines the transition from commensal growth to pathogenesis. As such, tools
for the timely diagnosis and treatment of serious fungal infections are lacking. Our laboratory has taken
unbiased genetic and hypothesis-directed approaches to identify fungal regulators of gut colonization.
Using a library of >700 barcoded homozygous null mutants that we created, we identified 14 fungal
transcription factors (TFs) that determine C. albicans fitness in a mouse model of gut colonization. We
hypothesize that complex signals in local gut niches lead to TF activation, and activated TFs modulate
the expression of the fungal effectors that directly foster commensalism. Recently, we implemented a
C. albicans -Seq (CCS), which uses
transposase-transcription factor fusion proteins to permanently mark genomic sites of transcription
factor binding by transposon integration. Pairing CCS with transcriptomic analysis of mutants affecting
three TFs (Efg1, Wor1, and Czf1), we captured the in-host activity of these regulators during active gut
colonization. We then mined these datasets to predict and validate the first two commensal effector
proteins to be described in this species, determining that the GPI-anchored cell wall chitinase Cht2
promotes commensal fitness, and that the secreted aspartyl protease Sap6 inhibits commensal fitness.

Undiagnosed disease remains a major burden for millions of Americans and their families. Here, we propose the Yale Diagnostic Center of Excellence (YDCoE) as a new site for the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). The YDCoE builds on the outstanding track record of human genetics, next generation sequencing (NGS) and rare disease discovery at Yale over many decades. To expand access to the UDN, we will partner with multiple community healthcare organizations that provide services for poor individuals who are under/uninsured, all of whom see >90% patients belonging to racial and ethnic minority groups. These partnerships are mutually beneficial, as the YDCoE will provide training and education opportunities in undiagnosed and rare diseases for these organizations. We will work with the DMCC to develop an enrollment plan that utilizes a tiered evaluation strategy. Our highly efficient clinical evaluation approaches and infrastructure will allow us scale clinical capacity to engage more participants over time, a significant portion of which will be covered by community and third-party payer support. For patients who remain without a diagnosis, we will leverage our extensive expertise in NGS approaches, cutting-edge bioinformatics and functional genomics – including in vivo and MPRA approaches - to increase diagnostic yield. Finally, we will conduct additional site-specific studies to enhance clinical evaluation efficiency, enrollment and patient experience. These include novel machine learning approaches to extract clinical information from EHR for more efficient evaluation and diagnoses, an augmented enrollment approach for uniquely vulnerable individuals, and a novel tool to measure patient-reported measures of discrimination in care. We have further secured additional institutional and industry support, which will allow us to prioritize NIH funds for under/uninsured patients. Altogether, our in-house clinical genetics operations together with our extensive network of community and industry partnerships, our expertise in NGS and bioinformatics innovation, our innovative track record in rare disease discovery and the vast clinical knowledge base across multiple specialties at YSM to form a DCoE that is fully equipped to engage a diverse cohort of underserved patients at an unprecedented clinical scale."

Wolbachia are a genus of endosymbiotic bacteria that comprise a promising, cost-effective tool to curb arboviral
transmission based on two key facets. First, Wolbachia block pathogenic RNA viruses by inhibiting their
replication in arthropods. Second, Wolbachia selfishly alter sperm and egg via a process termed cytoplasmic
incompatibility (CI) that can drive the bacteria into host populations. CI is expressed as embryonic lethality in
crosses between infected males and uninfected females, but this lethality is rescued in crosses between infected
males and infected females, which are the transmitting sex of Wolbachia. Consequently, CI is deployed in field
trials to either suppress mosquito population sizes or replace uninfected populations with infected individuals
resistant to arboviral infection. We recently discovered pre-fertilization impairments to sperm genome integrity
that underpin the CI drive. The CI-causing Cif proteins CifA and CifB from a prophage region in wMel interact
with developing spermatid nuclei to alter the epigenetically-controlled, histone-to-protamine transition, namely
by increasing histone retention in developing spermatids and decreasing protamine levels in the mature sperm.
The Cif proteins do not paternally transfer to the fertilized embryos, instead the modified sperm in testes with
impaired chromatin integrity transfers to bestow CI. Despite decades of intense research and current applications
to vector control, the mechanistic details of these pre-fertilization impairments remain a central enigma and are
only now subject to investigation. Here, we propose the first, in-depth examination of CI-defining histone marks
and protamine types to test the central hypothesis that the Cif proteins alter epigenetic events during
gametogenesis to cause CI and rescue. In Aim 1, we will use CUT&Tag chromatin profiling to determine CI-
defining, pre-fertilization changes in sperm histone modifications causing histone retention in wMel-infected
Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti. We will also test the essentiality of these epigenetic changes to CI
by chemically inhibiting histone modifier enzymes. In Aim 2, we will investigate the type and abundance of CI-
defining protamines that are depleted in mature sperm. Knockout and knockdown transgenic experiments will
link CI-defining embryonic death with the necessity of specific sperm protamine genes. Finally in Aim 3, we will
evaluate rescue-defining changes in the gametic chromatin by first characterizing maternal changes in histone
transcripts and protein abundance during oogenesis. We will then determine post-fertilization epigenetic changes
in sperm DNA that orchestrate paternal chromatin decondensation for embryonic viability. We will also validate
the essentiality of epigenetic modifiers to rescue by inhibiting their enzymatic activity. Despite the rising interest
in deploying Wolbachia to curb arbovirus transmission, studies have not yet yielded a refined, molecular
breakthrough uncovering the host epigenetics driving Wolbachia. If successful, the proposed research will (i)
reveal the incipient, host epigenetic events underlying the CI drive system at the heart of vector control strategies
and (ii) provide a significant gateway to eventually engineer CI and rescue via the host arthropod itself."

The canonical phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway uses free membrane PI lipid to
regulate cell growth and is frequently hyperactivated in cancer. Akt is also activated in the nucleus by poorly
understood mechanisms. We discovered a nuclear PI3K/Akt pathway composed of PI kinases/phosphatases
that modify phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPns) linked to p53 (p53-PIPn signalosome). PIPKI
synthesizes p53-PIP2 that stabilizes it and regulates MDM2. The PI3K inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK)
converts p53-PIP2 to p53-PIP3, which is reversed by PTEN. p53-PIP3 recruits the full Akt pathway leading to
nuclear Akt activation that regulates FOXOs, MDM2, genomic stress and cell survival.
Hypothesis/Objective: Nuclear Akt is dose activated by p53-PIP3. The p53-PIPn complex is stabilized by MDM2
and MDM2 is also PIPn-linked. IPMK and PTEN control the generation of p53-PIP3 that activates nuclear Akt.
Mutant p53-PIP3-Akt signaling, unlike p53wt, is constitutively activated and further stimulated by genotoxic stress,
resulting in enhanced cell survival and promoting tumor initiation and promotion. We will test this in 4 aims.
Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms of nuclear Akt activation by the p53-PIPn signalosome. Define the roles
and mechanisms of IPMK kinase and PTEN activity toward the p53-PIPn complexes by elucidating the structural
interaction of IPMK and PTEN with p53. Using this structural information, we will determine how genotoxic stress-
induced PTMs on p53, IPMK and PTEN regulate the p53-PIPn signalosome and nuclear Akt activation.
Aim 2. The residues that link PIPn to p53 and MDM2 will be defined, and mutants made that block PIPn
linkage and nuclear Akt activation. We will determine if there are different PIP linkages for p53wt and p53mt.
Aim 3. Define mechanisms for p53 stabilization by MDM2, sHSPs and PIPns. The stability of p53 is key for
p53-PIP3 activation of Akt and is regulated by MDM2. MDM2 is also PIPn-linked and the mechanisms by which
PIPns and sHSPs regulate the p53-MDM2 pathway will be studied. MDM2 PIPn linkage and binding mutants will
be used to investigate the role of PIPns in regulating MDM2 ligase activity, interactions with p53 and p53 stability.
The PIP kinases and PTEN that generate the MDM2-PIPn complexes will be defined and studied.
Aim 4. Define roles of the p53-PIPn signalosome in regulating tumor growth. Using cellular and murine
models of breast cancer, we will determine the functional role of the p53-PIPn signalosome in tumor suppression
by p53wt and transformation/tumor progression by p53mt. We will also determine whether the expression of p53-
PIPn and p53-PIP3-Akt complexes in clinical breast cancer specimens correlates with clinical outcomes.
Significance: We have discovered a novel nuclear PI3K/Akt pathway scaffolded on p53 that is independent
of the canonical membrane-localized pathway and insensitive to PI3K inhibitors in the clinic, underscoring its
therapeutic relevance. Also, as the p53-PIP3-Akt pathway is differentially activated for wild-type and mutant p53,
this may represent a fundamental mechanism for mutant p53 oncogenic activity."

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly termed nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), affects approximately 25% of adults and 10% of children in the United States. Multi-factorial
in its pathogenesis, the clinical/histologic spectrum of MASLD encompasses steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-
associated steatohepatitis (MASH), variable degrees of fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The presence of MASH or
advanced fibrosis due to MASLD are associated with increased risks of hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), and death. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for treatment of MASH. The sheer
scale of the affected population creates an urgent need for effective treatments as well as non-invasive modalities
and biomarkers that alone or in combination accurately 1) predict who is at high risk for disease progression in
the MASLD population, 2) detect and stage MASLD, MASH, and liver fibrosis, 3) predict treatment response, as
determined by ≥ 1-stage improvement in fibrosis or MASH resolution.
Since its inception in 2002, the NASH CRN has worked collaboratively to characterize the natural history of
MASLD, define its pathogenesis, and develop superior diagnostics and effective treatments. During the past
funding cycle (2018-23), the CRN completed recruitment for the longitudinal adult and pediatric Database 2
registry (N=3,068) and the STOP-NAFLD trial (N=83). In addition, it initiated two studies: 1) Database 3, a
longitudinal study of the etiology, natural history, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of MASLD and MASH with
a goal of recruiting a diverse cohort, and 2) the Vitamin E Dosing Study (VEDS), a clinical trial with the primary
aim of determining the minimum effective dose of Vitamin E for MASH.
The NASH CRN’s highly characterized cohorts, including more than 700,000 biospecimens in the NIDDK
repository, together with the investigator’s expertise in leveraging public-private partnerships, has allowed us to
perform innovative clinical trials and pursuits in diagnostic development and validation that can only be
addressed by engaging in a coordinated, longitudinal, comprehensive research consortium. The overriding
primary objective of the NASH CRN continues to be clinical research on MASLD in children and adults. A
secondary objective of high priority is to conduct translational research in MASH and MASLD and to develop
superior diagnostics and treatments, with a focus on diagnostics that are non-invasive and treatments that are
safe, affordable, effective and readily available.
The specific aims proposed to achieve these objectives from the UCSD Clinical Center during the continuation
of the NASH CRN are to 1) complete the Database 3 Study, 2) complete the VEDS Study, and 3) validate and
advance development of novel non-invasive biomarkers for MASH, at-risk MASH, and advanced fibrosis or
cirrhosis."
10995071,"ABSTRACT
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a widely prevalent bloodborne infection, with approximately 71 million global
(2.4 million in USA) chronic infections worldwide. HCV infection is frequently asymptomatic and many of those
infected are unaware of their illness. Untreated HCV infection may lead to chronic liver disease, such as
hepatocellular carcinoma, and accounts for an estimated 1.1 million annual global deaths (14,000 USA). Within
the last six years, direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have demonstrated high cure rates (90-95%) across all
genotypes in less than 12 weeks of all-oral treatment. These highly effective therapeutics offer a path toward
ending the HCV epidemic as drugs become more affordable and global health efforts prioritize expanded access.
The rollout of DAAs relies on diagnostic testing to identify HCV cases and rapidly link eligible patients to treatment
options. In most clinical settings, current HCV testing protocols use a rapid antibody test to diagnose past or
current cases of HCV. While rapid HCV antibody tests are easy to use and widely available, current HCV nucleic
acid amplification tests (NAATs) require venipuncture blood samples and central laboratories where tests are
run by trained technicians on complex, expensive equipment, causing delayed test results and loss to follow-up.
Recent initiatives by the Whitehouse White House’s HCV Elimination Program, WHO, MSF Access Campaign,
and NIH (NOSI: NOT-AI-23-001) have encouraged the development of point-of-care (POC) HCV NAATs to
provide accessible and rapid diagnosis of chronic HCV and aid in the rollout of DAAs. Decentralized, clinic-based
HCV NAATs offer a streamlined approach to patient care where a single test may be used to diagnose HCV,
identify active viremia, and later confirm a cure. There is an abundance of commercial POC NAAT tests for
respiratory diseases, such as influenza or SARS-COV-2, but due to the significant technical challenges of
detecting low viral titers in blood samples, there are no available capillary whole blood rapid POC NAATs for
HCV that meet target product profiles. We have developed a new approach for an integrated POC NAAT for
detecting HCV from whole blood. Our proposed HCV test is a significant departure from most existing POC tests
that use classical extraction methods (solid phase extraction), multiple buffer exchanges, reaction chambers,
PCR amplification, and robotics for physical actuation to automate and miniaturize laboratory-based PCR
workflows. Here, we propose an innovative paper-based device with novel whole blood sample preparation and
electrophoretically-mediated RNA purification, amplification, that is capable of simultaneously extracting and
amplifying viral HCV RNA from whole capillary blood using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase
amplification. The test cartridge consists of a paper and plastic device with no moving parts and provides results
in less than 30 minutes. This low complexity diagnostic test is intended to be CLIA-waived and uses a disposable
cartridge model with costs less than $5 and a benchtop reader costing less than $500, enabling expanded use
in resource-limited clinics."

Aortic stenosis (AS)—narrowing of the aortic valve—is the most common heart valve disease. Degeneration of
leaflets in AS leads to valvular obstruction, thickening of the heart muscle, heart failure, and death. Due to an
aging population, the healthcare burden of AS continues to rise, yet it remains one of the major cardiovascular
diseases for which there are no preventive or disease-modifying treatments. Currently, the clinical strategy is
watchful waiting, until severe symptoms appear. At this late stage, the risk of death rises significantly, and valve
replacement is the only option. Currently, we lack tools to predict which patients will experience a rapid worsening
of their condition.
Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is increasingly used for noninvasive assessment of AS. Guided by
our preliminary studies, we propose to develop and validate artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled fully automated
quantification of fibrotic and calcific aortic valve tissue characteristics from CTA. We aim to derive radiomic
features of peri-aortic adipose tissue (which serve as indicators of vascular inflammation). We propose to
predict rapid aortic valve disease progression, in men and women. We will combine CTA-measured aortic valve
tissue characteristics and inflammation along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the
prediction of mortality and stroke following valve replacement. For this project, we have assembled “real-world”
clinical, imaging, and follow-up data in 7442 patients from all stages of AS—from prospective clinical trials as
well as large multicenter, multiethnic patient registries.
We propose three specific aims: (1) To develop and validate a fully automated deep learning algorithm for the
characterization of fibrotic and calcific aortic valve tissue from standard CTA, in comparison with expert readers
and histopathological tissue analysis. (2) To assess the concordance between fibrocalcific aortic valve tissue
characteristics and functional valve hemodynamics by echocardiography and further, to predict rapid aortic valve
disease progression, in men and women, in prospective AS clinical trials. (3) To create and externally validate
an AI-powered risk score—integrating patient clinical data, fibrotic and calcific aortic valve tissue characteristics,
and peri-aortic vascular inflammation—to predict death and stroke within 1-year post-valve replacement.
The proposed work will provide, for the first time, automated, multi-parametric assessment of aortic valve tissue
and vascular inflammation characteristics from standard CTA. By predicting the likelihood of adverse
outcomes, the tool could enable the creation of personalized treatment and management plans, and guide post-
operative management, including the need for intensive monitoring, medication adjustments, and follow-up
appointments. This research will allow comprehensive phenotyping of AS, paving the way to image-informed
clinical trials of new therapies."

Metabolic presbyacusis is a major type of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) associated with decreased
endocochlear potential and elevated auditory thresholds due to degeneration of the stria vascularis (SV). The
SV, located in the lateral wall of the cochlea, is a highly active, bioenergetic, vascularized epithelium that
conducts essential functions necessary for driving hair cell transduction. Recent studies have identified strial
atrophy and pathological alterations of the strial microvasculature, marked by immune cell activation as important
factors contributing to age-related cochlear degeneration. Our recent study suggest that age-related aberrant
macrophage activity is an initial contributor to strial dysfunction, cochlear pathology, and hearing loss. Using an
established ARHL mouse model, we showed increased macrophage activation and inflammation in the SV
beginning at middle age, an age at which there is minimal loss of sensory hair cells and cochlear neurons.
Related to these findings, recent evidence signifies mitochondrial dysfunction to be strongly associated with
immune cell dysregulation. Specifically, the release of mitochondrial damage associated molecular patterns
(mtDAMPs) via impaired mitochondrial quality control (ex. fission & mitophagy) can initiate an inflammatory
response. Our preliminary data using quantitative ultrastructural and immunohistochemical approaches reveal
significant age-related reductions in mitochondrial size and metabolic activity within marginal cells of the SV. In
addition, significant alterations in mitochondrial quality control, which is aimed at preserving mitochondrial
integrity and metabolic activity, was observed beginning at middle age in an ARHL mouse model. Based on these
observations, our central hypothesis is that strial degeneration results from impaired mitochondrial quality
control in marginal cells of the aged cochlea, contributing to increased oxidative stress, macrophage activation,
and inflammation. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that strial dysfunction/degeneration results from
exacerbated mitochondrial fission and subsequent impaired mitophagy in marginal cells of the aged cochlea,
leading to increased oxidative stress and reduced mitochondrial metabolic activity. A well-characterized ARHL
mouse model and a newly developed SV ex vivo system will be employed where the assessment of mitochondrial
quality control, mitochondrial ROS levels, and respiratory capacity within strial marginal cells will be elucidated
over the course of aging. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that impaired mitochondrial quality control
propagates the activation of strial macrophages leading to inflammation via the release of mtDAMPs in marginal
cells of the aged cochlea. A cochlea specific genetic mouse model will be used to determine the extent to which
deletion of Oma1, master regulator of stress induced mitochondrial fission, impacts strial macrophage activation
and inflammation. Ultimately, understanding age-related mitochondrial alterations in the cochlea will aid in the
development of therapeutic agents designed to combat inflammation within the aging inner ear."

Dynamic rewiring of gene regulatory networks enables cell fate determination partly through differential gene
expression. This process requires spatial organization of dozens of factors at precise genomic loci.
Compartmentalization of transcription machinery into condensates—dynamic, mesoscale, local densities of
proteins—has emerged as a mechanism coordinating this process. Although the function of condensates has
been described in some cases, the mechanisms of their activity—particularly during cell fate determination—
remain unclear.
 Many cell types are characterized by expression of cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. The MYOCD
coactivator is one such regulator for smooth muscle cell lineages. Using MYOCD as a case study, I have found
that MYOCD-mediated gene activation and cell fate determination depend on switch-like, condensate formation.
These studies also demonstrated the MYOCD trans-activation (TAD) domain is required for condensate
formation and function. Surprisingly, substitution of the TAD domain for the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)
of FUS or CDT1, two unrelated proteins known to form condensates, maintains condensate formation, but only
substitution with the FUS-IDR activates gene expression. This indicates not only is self-association of the
MYOCD coactivator essential for function, but that condensate formation mediated by distinct IDRs can exhibit
distinct functionalities.
 I hypothesize coactivator condensates—mediated by different IDRs—confer distinct biochemical
environments by directing genomic localization of gene expression machinery and selectively
compartmentalizing transcriptional machinery into condensates to drive gene activation and cell fate
determination. To address this hypothesis, I have developed an interdisciplinary and rigorous approach using
various microscopy-, biochemical-, and sequencing-based experiments to model MYOCD-mediated condensate
formation, gene activation and cell fate determination."

 Pacific Islanders in the US are disproportionately affected by diabetes, obesity, and hypertension.
Among US Pacific Islanders, those most at risk are resident in the US-affiliated Pacific Island territories, which
are geographically isolated, medically underserved, health professional shortage areas. Despite obesity often
being established in childhood, adolescence is a critical time for intervention to prevent associated chronic
diseases. In American Samoa, this age group has been completely overlooked in existing efforts to mitigate
disease risk. There is a need to intervene on adolescent's individual behaviors, but health-related decisions are
not made in vacuum – family, peers, and the wider surrounding environment are important influences. Equally,
adolescents play a critical role in food preparation in the Samoan familial structure and are responsible for
cooking daily meals for immediate and extended family from early adolescence, thereby shaping familial risk.
To date, there has been limited consideration of specific Samoan cultural and social influences on adolescent
risk behaviors. The important impacts AS adolescents may have on familial and peer habits have also been
underrecognized. Therefore, the central premise of this thesis is to understand the distribution of obesity,
diabetes, and hypertension, and factors associated with these conditions, in the adolescent population in
American Samoa. With this proposal we will: (1) use qualitative methods to identify factors influencing healthful
nutrition among American Samoan adolescents; (2) employ a school-based survey to identify factors
associated with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in adolescents in American Samoa; and (3) use social
network analysis to examine the patterning of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension among friendship networks
in American Samoa. Findings from this work are expected to enhance our understanding of the range of
behavioral and social influences on chronic disease risk in this setting and to concretely inform future
intervention strategies. Importantly, the findings are likely to translate to Pacific Islander adolescents in other
settings in the US and US-affiliated Pacific Islands. Through this work the applicant will develop skills in
qualitive methods, advanced epidemiologic study design and management of epidemiological surveys, and
social network analysis. This training is central to the applicant's long-term goal of become a Pacific-focused
noncommunicable disease epidemiologist integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with locally relevant
interventions to support health promotion in Pacific Island communities."
10996339,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Beyond its role in conducting the air required for respiration, the airway epithelium plays a critical role in host
defense through its physical and immunological properties. Specialized secretory cells present in the epithelium
secrete airway mucins, which form a viscous hydrogel protecting the epithelial surface, and the coordinated
beating of multiciliated cells propels this surface liquid and trapped foreign material away from the lower airways.
TP63+ airway basal cells serve as the progenitor cell to replenish all other epithelial cell populations. Additional
rare cell types with as-of-yet incompletely defined functions include FOXI1+ ionocytes and POU2F3+ tuft-like
cells. All epithelial cell types constitute a selectively permeable physical barrier by forming cell-cell junctions with
neighboring cells, such that an electrochemical gradient can be maintained across epithelial boundary. Besides
these physical functions, airway epithelial cells participate in both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms
through pathogen sensing, release of cytokines, and crosstalk with immune cells. The type I interferon (IFN-I)
response is a broad-spectrum, first-line innate immune defense against viruses. While traditionally viewed as
relatively uniform across cell types, preliminary data from our lab and collaborators show that IFN-I induces
distinct gene expression programs across airway cell types, hinting at possible functional heterogeneity in the
IFN-I response on a per-cell type basis. However, it is unclear whether these altered gene expression patterns
and associated transcriptional regulators have functional significance in the context of respiratory virus infection.
A diverse group of respiratory viruses infect the airway epithelium, including influenza viruses, rhinoviruses,
“common-cold” coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. These can be important triggers for acute exacerbations of
chronic airway disease states. The proposed project will develop state-of-the-art CRISPRa/i functional genomics
approaches to perturb IFN-induced regulators and effectors of innate immunity in a human, physiologically
relevant model of the human airway epithelium. This will enable precise functional profiling of the IFN-I response
in individual airway epithelial cell types. Altogether, this work will shed light on how the airway epithelium functions
as an integrated unit to mediate host defense against respiratory viruses and strike a balance between effective
host defense and immune homeostasis (using influenza A virus as a clinically relevant model respiratory
pathogen), with the ultimate goal of developing novel host-directed antiviral therapeutic strategies. More
generally, I anticipate the proposed experimental system developed here will be broadly valuable for precise
genetic characterization of other airway disease states and their interaction with respiratory virus infection,
including COPD, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. This project also presents a unique opportunity for training in both
experimental and computational research approaches relevant to airway biology and respiratory virus infection."

Primary cilia are evolutionarily conserved cellular antennas comprised of a microtubular (MT) axoneme
enveloped by a lipid sheath. They are found at the surface of most mammalian cells that have terminally
differentiated or entered quiescence. Interestingly, cilia are enriched for proteins required to transduce Sonic
Hedgehog and Wnt signaling. Indeed, defects in cilia have been linked to both developmental disorders and
cancer, reflecting its intimate relationship with particular signaling pathways that control cell cycle and
polarization. Ciliogenesis requires the coordination of multiple events: (1) timely recruitment of various Rab
GTPase-positive vesicles to the mother centriole; (2) basal body migration to the plasma membrane; and (3)
growth of microtubules to assemble the ciliary axoneme. MT dynamics are controlled by post translational
modifications (PTMs), such as glutamylation, and the ciliary axoneme is highly poly-glutamylated. Poly-
glutamylation is mediated by a family of tubulin tyrosine-like ligases (TTLLs), including TTLL1, which the
Dynlacht laboratory has extensively characterized. Unlike other TTLLs, TTLL1 forms a multimeric Tubulin Poly-
glutamylation Complex (TPGC) with seven other proteins. We recently identified TBC1D19, a protein of
unknown function, as a novel component of TPGC. TBC1D19 may be an enzyme, as it has a TBC domain,
which shares homology to GTP-activating protein (GAP) domains. We generated a knock-out of TBC1D19 in
mammalian cells and observed a number of novel and exciting phenotypes, including loss of ciliation and
changes in Golgi size and morphology. We will investigate whether these phenotypes can be ascribed to
defects in poly-glutamylation, loss of GAP function, or an unknown activity. These findings suggest a
potentially wider role for TBC1D19 and the TPGC that links microtubule poly-glutamylation with vesicle
trafficking, organelle morphology, and microtubule dynamics. This research will ultimately further our
understanding of microtubules and ciliation in development and disease."

Suicide is the third leading cause of death among youth ages 15-24 in the United States. Accurate assessment
of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is critical in research and clinical practice. Brief assessments (e.g.,
single items) are necessary for feasibility in many contexts, but little work has focused on validating brief STB
assessments, and extant research has documented wide discrepancies in reports of STBs across measures.
Invalid STB assessments have profound implications for development of suicide theories, research on suicide
risk and protective factors, and clinical management of STBs, ultimately hampering suicide prevention. Despite
the challenges of STB assessment, single-item measures can have adequate psychometric properties,
comparable to their multi-item counterparts. Psychometric validation and standardization of STB measures will
improve replicability of research findings and facilitate accurate identification of STBs in risk assessment, which
is critical to management and prevention of STBs. The proposed study will recruit two samples of youth ages
15-24 with lived experience of STBs in order to refine single-item STB measures, test their psychometric
properties, and identify other factors impacting response accuracy. Toward the long-term objective of
improving prevention of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in youth, this study has 3 specific aims: (1) develop a
pool of clear, interpretable items to assess youths’ experiences with STBs using cognitive interviewing, (2)
examine psychometric properties of the resulting set of single-item STB measures, and (3) identify factors that
impact responses beyond item interpretation through an implementation science framework. The proposed
research and training activities will be conducted at Texas Tech University. This fellowship will provide
specialized training necessary for the applicant to become an impactful independent clinical scientist.
Training will focus on three goals: (1) enhance knowledge of youth STBs and research best practices with
youth through regular mentor meetings, lab meetings, guided readings, and attendance at youth advisory
board meetings and relevant conferences, (2) gain expertise in cognitive interviewing and other qualitative
research methods through formal courses and workshops, regular mentor meetings, guided readings, and lab
meetings, guided applied practice, and collaborating on projects using existing cognitive interview data, and (3)
gain expertise in stakeholder-centered approaches to designing and implementing suicide-focused research
with youth using dissemination and implementation science principles through guided readings, lab meetings,
regular mentor meetings, attending workshops, and guided applied practice. Results of this study will
provide actionable recommendations for brief assessment of STBs, improving management of risk and
data collection accuracy for STBs assessed in research and clinical contexts."

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which occurs when a fetus is exposed to alcohol, is a
neurodevelopmental disorder affecting up to 5% of the US population. One of the most devastating outcomes
for children with FASD are learning and memory deficits, the mechanisms of which are little understood.
Essential for learning and memory, sharp wave ripples (SWRs) are high frequency neural oscillatory events
observed in the CA1 region of the hippocampus that travel to the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Third trimester
alcohol exposure (TTAE) in particular leads to severe neuronal death in the RSC and dysfunction in neuronal
populations necessary for SWR formation. Despite this clear damage, little is known about how TTAE affects
SWRs in the RSC. To fill this gap in knowledge, I propose the use of a mouse model of TTAE together with in
vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics to investigate the effects on SWR characteristics across learning.
Electrodes will be implanted in the CA1 and RSC, allowing for data collection while navigating a Barnes maze
(BM) spatial navigation learning and memory task. Recordings will continue for 24 hours following the end of
the task each day to gather SWRs that occur during Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep when memories
are consolidated. Multiple analytical tools will be used to investigate the impact of TTAE on two key SWR
features - amplitude and duration. Additional tools will be used to assess the firing rates and waveforms of
individual neurons, to determine the impact of TTAE on the recruitment of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons
by SWRs and the “replay” of these neurons during NREM. A separate and smaller subset of subjects will
undergo optogenetic induction of SWRs, principally to evaluate if TTAE leads to alterations in SWR CA1
induction thresholds and/or propagation rates from CA1 to RSC. Collectively, this proposal will determine the
functional mechanisms of key phases of learning and the role of SWRs to these phases: Acquisition,
consolidation, retrieval and plasticity. The successful completion of this proposal will provide critical information
on the lasting neurological impacts of TTAE on SWRs in the RSC, and how this may affect learning and
memory. Additionally, this work will provide intensive training in awake/behaving electrophysiology,
optogenetics, and a wide variety of analytical tools."

 Brain cancer remains a devastating disease and in particular, brain metastases (BM) from breast cancer
represent the leading cause of fatality for women. The major hindrance to significant clinical benefit for BM is the
poor permeability of monoclonal antibodies (i.e. trastuzumab) across the blood brain barrier (BBB), resulting in
surgical resection and radiation therapies as the first line therapeutic options. With our team of experienced and
highly accomplished scientists with strong track record in basic, translational, and clinical research, we propose
to advance the science of metastases to the brain by focusing on 1) understanding of fundamental biology of
HER2+ breast cancer metastases to the brain via patient tissue-based genetic dissection of risk factors 2) the
advancement in real-time of visualization of cancer cells and neural stem cells (NSCs) targeting HER2+ BM and
3) the application of targeted NSC delivery of trastuzumab analogs to suppress the growth of HER2+ BM. The
novel paradigm established by this application will advance our understanding of how cancer cells invade and
spread thru the brain and potentially help herald an era of genetically engineered stem cells as targeted delivery
conduit for anti-HER2 therapy against HER2+ BM."
10977249,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Aspirin is one of the most used drugs in the world. Unfortunately, many older adults will consume aspirin
without an established indication, a scenario in which risks (i.e., bleeding) likely outweigh benefits (i.e., primary
stroke/myocardial infarction prevention). Furthermore, many patients use aspirin in the presence of drug-drug
interactions that increase bleeding risk and in the presence of relative contraindications (i.e., history of
recurrent falls). Deprescribing - the purposeful discontinuation or dose reduction of potentially inappropriate
drugs – of chronic aspirin use should be considered after the manifestation of a bleeding event resulting in an
emergency department (ED) visit. Yet, little is known if older adults on chronic aspirin will discuss the possibility
of deprescribing with their primary provider/aspirin prescriber after an ED bleeding event. The objective of this
proposal is to conduct foundational research, guided by Intervention Mapping Theory (IMT), to inform the
development of a novel ED-based deprescribing intervention to address aspirin use among older adults with
bleeding. Aim 1 is to determine the frequency with which older adults receive counseling on the benefits and
risks of chronic aspirin use 14 days after a bleeding event requiring ED care. Aim 2a is to identify patient and
provider factors associated with absence of counseling on the benefits/risks of aspirin within 14 days of an ED
visit for bleeding. Aim 2b is to conduct qualitative interviews to understand the patients’ perspective on the
decision-making process in continuing (or discontinuing) aspirin use after a bleeding event. In applying IMT, we
will demonstrate the need and theoretical framework for a paradigm shifting ED-based intervention to facilitate
supervised deprescribing of aspirin after an ED encounter for bleeding. This study will be led by an ED
physician (Martin Casey MD MPH) who seeks to build a career in leveraging the ED to promote deprescribing
and medication optimization in older adults. His work will be completed under the guidance of a diverse
mentorship team with expertise in aging epidemiology (Michelle Meyer PhD), geriatric cardiology (Parag Goyal
MD MSc), geriatrics and deprescribing (Jan Busby-Whitehead MD), and geriatric ED care processes (Ula
Hwang MD). In completing this work with his mentorship team, Dr. Casey will move towards becoming a
pioneering emergency medicine physician with expertise in deprescribing."
10978109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Aging is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and Alzheimer's disease and its related
dementias (ADRD),1, 2 due in part to adverse changes in peripheral vascular endothelial3 and cerebral vascular
function,4 respectively (i.e., vascular aging). Regular aerobic exercise (AE) protects against vascular aging by
favorably targeting several pillars of aging (i.e. inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cell senescence,
impaired nutrient sensing and proteostasis) and reducing oxidative stress. However, there is considerable
heterogeneity in the endothelial and cerebral vascular benefits to AE in middle-age and older (MA/O) adults,
including sex differences. The reason(s) for AE response variation are poorly understood but could be related
to age/sex differences in the biological changes underlying vascular aging and/or the molecular transducers
(i.e., circulating exerkines including endothelial microvesicles [EMVs]) that communicate and coordinate the
effects of AE on the vasculature in the periphery and brain. Here, we propose a randomized controlled 12-
week intervention of AE (3 d/week, 60-80% heart rate reserve, ~1 h duration) or non-exercise control in groups
of young (18-39 years), middle-aged (40-59 years) and older (≥60 years) adults, balanced by sex. Outcomes to
be assessed before and after the intervention include: 1) peripheral endothelial function (brachial artery flow-
mediated dilation -- primary outcome), 2) cerebrovascular function (cerebrovascular reactivity to a hypercapnic
stimulus -- primary outcome), and 3) biospecimens: blood and/or vascular endothelial cells assayed for
transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and EMVs and their cargo (e.g., micro RNA) obtained (a) before, (b)
during (blood only) and (c) after acute treadmill AE (40 minutes; 60-80% VO2max) or control period. Aim 1 will
determine if pre- and post-intervention molecular signatures associated with the pillars of aging are associated
with age and sex differences in vascular adaptations to chronic AE training. Aim 2 will determine the influence
of age and sex on the dynamic circulating molecular responses to acute and chronic AE, and their association
with changes in vascular function with chronic AE. Aim 3 will determine if circulating exerkines (e.g., EMVs)
are linked to changes in peripheral and cerebral vascular endothelial cell function with chronic AE, as well as
the corresponding influences of age and sex, by assessing peripheral (aortic) and cerebral endothelial cell
culture nitric oxide, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and reactive oxygen species production pre-post AE or
non-exercise control after serum or EMV exposure. The proposed research will advance our understanding of
the molecular signals and pathways underlying the systemic and local effects of AE on endothelial and
cerebral vascular function that may explain the heterogeneity in AE responses with age and sex. This
knowledge will allow for the development of personalized age- and sex-specific AE recommendations, and/or
provide insights into molecular targets that can be manipulated to enhance and/or mimic exercise in non-
responders or in persons unable to exercise."

Mitochondria are essential organelles for maintaining cellular redox, energy, and metabolic homeostasis. The
hub of mitochondrial function is its electron transport chain (ETC) which is necessary for numerous functions,
including ATP generation. There are over 300 inherited mutations that can impair ETC function and lead to
devastating neuromuscular disorders (e.g., Leigh syndrome) for which there are no FDA-approved therapies.
This is in large part because of our incomplete understanding of the disease pathophysiology. Recent studies
have demonstrated that an elevated tissue NADH/NAD+ ratio, also known as NADH-reductive stress, caused by
ETC dysfunction is a major contributor to ETC diseases. NADH-reductive stress inhibits numerous crucial
biochemical reactions to cause tissue dysfunction and disease. However, the potential of targeting NADH-
reductive stress in ETC dysfunction for therapeutic benefits has not been extensively explored, primarily due to
the absence of tools to simultaneously mitigate NADH-reductive stress in all affected tissues. To this end, we
recently developed a proof-of-concept enzyme tool called LOXCAT to alleviate NADH-reductive stress in ETC
dysfunctions. LOXCAT is an engineered fusion of enzymes lactate oxidase (LOX) and catalase (CAT) that is
designed to irreversibly convert lactate into pyruvate. Intravenous injection of LOXCAT into mice with ETC
dysfunction lowers the blood lactate/pyruvate ratio and simultaneously decreases the NADH/NAD+ ratio in key
organs like the heart and the brain. This is because the extracellular lactate/pyruvate ratio is in near equilibrium
with the intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio via the cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) reaction. In cell culture
models of ETC dysfunction, supplemented extracellular LOXCAT can restore cellular redox and energy
homeostasis as well as rescue cell proliferation by alleviating NADH-reductive stress. This proposal aims to
utilize LOXCAT as a tool to further understand its mechanism of action and explore the therapeutic potential of
targeting NADH-reductive stress in ETC dysfunction. We will investigate: (a) how LOXCAT impacts global
metabolism and mitochondrial function in primary cortical neurons and fibroblasts of NDUFS4-null mice that
recapitulate complex I dysfunction in Leigh Syndrome, (b) how brain-specific vs systemic effects of LOXCAT
impacts survival, neurological symptoms, and tissue metabolism of the NDUFS4-null mice, and (c) re-engineer
LOXCAT to evade immunogenicity, if necessary. Leigh syndrome, a condition leading to progressive
neurodegeneration, is the most common pediatric manifestation of an ETC dysfunction. Since LOXCAT
alleviates NADH-reductive stress, a common outcome of the majority of ETC dysfunctions, it holds the potential
to be a therapy for various mitochondrial diseases, regardless of their underlying mutations. Overall, our proposal
will provide unprecedented opportunities to further evaluate NADH-reductive stress in mitochondrial disease and
open up the potential to develop the first therapy for neuromuscular diseases caused by mitochondrial
dysfunction."

Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the most severe form of Sleep-Disordered-Breathing (SDB), and is extremely
prevalent, affecting nearly a billion adults worldwide. OSA-associated morbidities affect virtually all organ
systems via activation and propagation of oxidative stress and systemic inflammatory pathways, de facto
mimicking accelerated biological aging. In particular, OSA is widely recognized as an independent cardiovascular
risk factor, associated with incident obesity, atherosclerosis, hypertension (HTN), endothelial dysfunction,
arrhythmias, stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Both epidemiologic and intervention-based
studies have provided conclusive evidence indicating a causative link between OSA and cardiovascular
morbidity. However, the physiological and molecular mechanisms of OSA-induced vascular senescence leading
to vascular dysfunction remain to be elucidated.
The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDNK2A), also known as p16, is a protein that slows cell division, and
its upregulation is a hallmark of cellular senescence in both mice and humans. Recently, selective elimination of
cells highly expressing the p16 protein (commonly referred to as p16high cells) was shown to improve and reverse
aging-associated diseases. Whether targeting vascular senescence can improve vascular outcomes in OSA has
not been investigated yet. In this project, it is hypothesized that chronic exposures to Intermittent Hypoxia (IH)
and Sleep Fragmentation (SF), two main features of OSA that can be reproduced in mouse models, will induce
accelerated vascular senescence in mice manifesting as vascular dysfunction. As a corollary, it is proposed that
eliminating p16high cells may reverse or attenuate IH- and SF-mediated vascular deficits. Three different
transgenic mouse models will be used: i) containing a p16 reporter, ii) enabling systemic ablation of p16high cells,
and iii) enabling the specific ablation of p16high vascular endothelial cells (vECs). These models will be exposed
to IH, SF and the combination of both (IH+SF), to investigate the phenotypic effects and molecular mechanisms
of OSA-induced cardiovascular senescence, and their reversibility through selective elimination of senescent cells
in the vasculature. Physiological and cardiovascular changes will be assessed at predetermined time points. By
studying DNA methylation profiles at each time points, it will be determined whether such exposures will induce
an acceleration in the biological age compared with the chronological age. This is referred to as “Epigenetic Age
Acceleration” and constitutes a novel approach for quantifying aging at systemic and tissue-specific level.
Furthermore, by studying whole genome DNA methylation and RNA profiles in tissues, isolated vECs and
primary vECs cultures, the pathways, and molecular networks responsible of the OSA-induced vascular
senescence and function will be investigated. This project will create a novel and innovative framework in OSA,
by mechanistically demonstrating the impact of cellular senescence on OSA-induced cardiovascular dysfunction
and providing a potential actionable target for therapeutic development."

 The co-use of tobacco and cannabis is prevalent, appears to be increasing among adults in the United States
(US), and has been shown to adversely affect treatment and other clinical outcomes. Yet, there are currently no
recommended treatment strategies for tobacco-cannabis co-use, nor are there tailored treatment strategies for
tobacco cessation among those who use cannabis. Treatment interventions addressing co-use have been
preliminary and none have been designed to evaluate an intervention compared to a control condition through a
fully-powered randomized controlled trial. Our preliminary data, supported by the larger literature, has shown
that: 1) cannabis co-use has a profound negative impact on cigarette abstinence, and 2) varenicline, an FDA
approved pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation, may be beneficial in reducing cannabis use. Collectively, our
results show promise for varenicline in reducing cannabis use and given its established efficacy for tobacco
cessation, there is strong justification for its evaluation for tobacco-cannabis co-use treatment, as proposed here.
 We propose to pair a promising pharmacotherapy (varenicline) with psychosocial support targeting co-use
in order to bolster treatment outcomes and reduce harms. This study is a completely remote 12-week treatment
trial among adults in South Carolina (ages 18+; N=200) who co-use cigarettes and cannabis regularly.
Participants will be included who smoke cigarettes daily or near daily (20+ days in the past 30; other regular
tobacco product use is exclusionary) and have used cannabis at least 3 times per week in the past month
(exclusive medical cannabis use is exclusionary). Participants will be randomized 1:1 to varenicline or placebo
and both groups will receive an evidence-based psychosocial intervention that includes real-time and
asynchronously delivered content (all delivered virtually). The aims of the study are to: 1) evaluate rates of 7-
day biochemically confirmed point prevalence abstinence (PPA) from cigarettes at the 12-week end of treatment
(EOT) visit comparing varenicline + psychosocial intervention to the placebo + psychosocial intervention
participants (Aim 1), 2) compare cannabis use frequency and amount between varenicline and placebo groups
from the target quit date until EOT (Weeks 1-12; Aim 2), and 3) explore differential treatment outcomes among
male vs. female participants (Exploratory Aim). There is an urgent need to evaluate treatment interventions
addressing the co-use of tobacco and cannabis in a general population of adults. The proposed intervention is
supported by rigorous prior research, including our own work, and the decentralized design and remote
intervention delivery contribute to the scalability of this intervention to address co-occurring tobacco and
cannabis use."
10978246,"This project will implement A Longitudinal Study of Egyptian Healthy Aging (“AL-SEHA”) including the harmonized cognitive assessment protocol (HCAP) to measure the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) in Egypt. It is modeled after the US HRS and member surveys and is aligned with several aspects of NIA’s mission, particularly “…the development of internationally comparative studies of physical, mental and cognitive health and harmonization efforts in different social, environmental, cultural, and economic contexts…” AL-SEHA fills a significant void in the international network of harmonized aging studies. As a pivotal constituent of the Middle East and Africa, Egypt has an enormously diversified population, socioeconomically, genomically, and culturally. Egypt is characterized by a strongly SES-graded health and cognitive decline up to the stage of dementia, a large gender divide, particularly for elderly women, and looming challenges for older citizens due to environmental and climatic challenges potentially causing ADRD. Despite advances, Egypt’s health and wellbeing landscape includes striking social and economic inequalities and inequities between men and women, old and young, urban and rural communities, and upper and lower Egypt. The project will inform issues of equity, gender, and climate concerns in a context that is new for the HRS-style aging surveys and their analyses of AD/ADRD.
While Egypt has a history of cross-sectional population surveys, AL SEHA will be the first nationally representative longitudinal study of aging in Egypt. This longitudinal dimension will fill a major gap and will provide a better understanding of the precursors and dynamics of physical, mental and cognitive health, including AD/ADRD, and the inequality and inequity in a large emerging economy that shape the SES-gradient of health. It will offer unprecedented opportunities to delineate health, social and economic challenges and to develop policy recommendations for this and similar emerging countries and communities. AL SEHA will be administered to 20,000 individuals aged 50 years and older. It will provide a baseline and a first follow-up wave including HCAP as tested and contextually validated tool to measure cognitive status and to assess AD/ADRD prevalence in Egypt, a community module, geocoded and environmental data.
Three years of preparatory activities included a first pilot that built research capacities and demonstrated scholarly and policy interest and commitment; a second pilot funded by NIA that tested the representative sample design and demonstrated the feasibility of high quality fieldwork within planned time and budget; and a third NIA-funded pilot that deployed the HCAP instrument to screen for AD/ADRD. The studies demonstrated need, feasibility, and ability of the team to undertake the proposed work, and the securing of the essential partnership of the Institute of National Planning (INP), the support of the Ministries of Planning and Economic Development and of Health and the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe.

In-hospital mortality prediction models (MPMs) are widely used in clinical research and practice; but existing
MPMs suffer from algorithmic bias, or systematic differences in performance by group. We and others showed
that MPMs for hospitalized patients – the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) and Laboratory-
based Acute Physiology Score, version 2 (LAPS2) – overestimate mortality for Black patients with acute
respiratory failure (ARF) or sepsis, and underestimate mortality for white patients. Biased MPMs may thus
produce healthcare inequities and flawed inferences about contributions of sociodemographics to clinical
outcomes. Therefore, we seek to develop, validate, and demonstrate the impact of a novel MPM that optimizes
fairness (i.e., defined by ‘groupwise optimality,’ optimizing subgroup performance without sacrificing predictive
accuracy) across key subgroups defined by race, ethnicity, sex, age, primary language, insurance status, and
social vulnerability without sacrificing accuracy. We will address key causes of bias in model development:
differential missing data and calibration biases. We will study hospitalized ARF and sepsis patients because
they face high risks of biased predictions due to diagnostic uncertainty and high mortality risk, and these
syndromes pose increased mortality risks for racial and ethnic minorities. In Aim 1, we will develop a fairness-
informed, in-hospital MPM. We will identify predictive features using those in common MPMs and structured
data within 24 hours of presentation. We will assess missing data bias by comparing feature proportions by
subgroup, excluding biased features, using a 2018-2023 cohort of ~220,000 encounters across 28 hospitals in
the University of Pennsylvania and Kaiser Permanente Northern California health systems. We will select
features using elastic net regression, and develop and internally validate a set of novel MPMs for use at
admission, building logistic and elastic net regression, and machine learning models. We will implement model
bias audits and mitigation strategies (i.e., multicalibration, optimizing calibration across subgroups without
sacrificing predictive accuracy) to develop a set of optimized MPMs. We will evaluate performance overall and
by subgroup, and compare performance to SOFA, LAPS2, and the Epic Deterioration Index. In Aim 2, we will
conduct focus groups among key stakeholders to present blinded results of the novel MPMs, varying subgroup
performance tradeoffs and decision thresholds, to select the model and thresholds that best promote equity
and accuracy. In Aim 3, we will test the external validity of this MPM among patients admitted to MedStar
Health, a health system serving primarily racial and ethnic minority patients, using a different electronic health
record. In Aim 4, we will quantify the impact of the novel MPM on key use cases, by (1) re-analyzing our team’s
pragmatic trials to assess the impact of risk adjustment on effect estimates overall and by subgroup; and (2)
performing microsimulation informed by intensive care unit (ICU) demand in our health systems during peak
COVID surges to compare ICU bed allocation across subgroups, compared to SOFA and LAPS2."

Pragmatic (i.e., social) language impairments are a defining feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that
impose a significant burden on individuals throughout their lifespan. Strong evidence suggests that pragmatic
language differences aggregate subclinically among first-degree relatives, reflecting the broad autism phenotype
(BAP), and have been linked to variation in FMR1, a highly penetrant ASD risk gene that causes fragile X
syndrome (FXS) and a constellation of clinical and neuropsychological phenotypes among women who carry the
FMR1 gene in its premutation (PM) state. In the prior award period, we demonstrated striking parallels in
pragmatic-related skills in the BAP and FMR1 PM, as well as important phenotypic distinctions, which together
point toward highly specific ASD-related skills that appear tied to the FMR1 gene. In this renewal application, we
build on this work with an expanded, multidisciplinary team of investigators to apply innovative multi-layered
deep behavioral and neural phenotyping, building on our most promising findings, with an armamentarium of
cutting-edge, computationally-based analytic platforms to further delineate the mechanistic contributors to ASD-
related pragmatic profiles in individuals with FMR1 mutations (fragile X syndrome and the FMR1 premutation).
Delineating the molecular genetic underpinnings of ASD-related pragmatic skills is crucial for understanding the
etiology of the social communication clinical symptom domain of ASD, which may reveal biologically based
targets for intervention. In this project, we will characterize ASD-related pragmatic profiles that extend beyond
traditional, categorically defined diagnostic boundaries among individuals with FMR1 mutations, and how such
profiles may be linked with targeted neurophysiological signatures and molecular genetic variation. This project
will capitalize on extensive, comparable data collected from individuals with ASD and parents with and without
the broad autism phenotype (BAP), available through an active companion R01. Aim 1 will apply both
hypothesis- and data-driven analytic approaches to a comprehensive battery assessing component skills
contributing to ASD-related pragmatic profiles in individuals with an FMR1 mutation. Aim 2 will employ a battery
of targeted, multidimensional electrophysiological measures to examine potential neural correlates of pragmatic
profiles. Finally, Aim 3 will evaluate the relationship between behavioral and neural phenotypic signatures
obtained in Aims 1 and 2 and FMR1-related genetic variation. Results from the prior phase of this project and
new preliminary data strongly implicate a complex network of skills contributing to ASD-related pragmatic profiles
among individuals with a FMR1 mutation that may be sensitively measured with the advanced fine-grained
computational- and machine-learning-based approaches proposed, with compelling ties to neurophysiological
and molecular genetic correlates that will be measured. The data produced will further the understanding of
clinical heterogeneity in ASD and the mechanistic origins of the pragmatic language clinical domain, and produce
phenotypes with translational potential for application in clinical trials, interventions, and treatment."

Human herpesvirus 6A and human herpesvirus 6B, collectively termed HHV-6A/B, are ubiquitous viruses that
permanently infect most humans from an early age. Initial HHV-6A/B infection mainly occurs from the contact of
infected saliva or nasal mucus with the respiratory tract. However, HHV-6A/B genome can be maintained
generation to generation through inheritance, which is mediated by the integration of HHV-6A/B genomes into
the telomeres of host cell chromosomes. Inherited chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 (iciHHV-6) is
seen in 1-2% of European and US populations and 0.6% of people in Japan. In these human populations, the
HHV-6 genome is integrated into the telomere of a single chromosome in every nucleated cell in the body. These
integrated viruses reactivate from the integrated chromosome to produce viral progenies. Reactivation of iciHHV-
6 is suggested to be associated with many disease developments that include encephalitis, spontaneous
abortions, pre-eclampsia, angina pectoris, and exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease following
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Accumulating evidence has also suggested the neurovirulence of HHV-
6A/B infection with several important neurological disorders. In particular, evidence indicates that HHV-6B
reactivation can cause acute limbic encephalitis in immunocompromised patients, and frequent viral reactivation
cycles result in temporal lobe epilepsy. However, a lack of suitable in vitro models to evaluate HHV-6A/B
reactivation from the integrated viral genome in neural cells, limits our study designs. This is because, for
diseases of the central nervous system, the affected tissue is challenging to access for study in living patients.
Such in vitro tissue culture models will examine risks of harboring iciHHV-6 in disease developments and
facilitate molecular analysis of iciHHV-6 reactivation/replication from integrated host chromosomes. Like other
virology research, establishing an in vitro culture model is vital to identify essential cellular or viral targets for
further therapeutic development. Here, we request funding to establish cell models to study iciHHV-6
reactivation. We will generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiate them into neural stem
cells. With the established resources, we will examine how and when iciHHV-6 reactivation is triggered. We will
test what physiological cell differentiation processes trigger iciHHV-6 reactivation. We will complete the tasks
with ongoing international collaboration, and develop essential resources for HHV-6A/B researchers."

Henipavirus (HNV) genus, named after the first two identified members, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus
(NiV), is a group of expanding zoonotic viruses that have caused repeated outbreaks with case fatality rate
reaching 75%. The exceptional broad species tropism and various transmission routes make HNV a risk of
potential future pandemics. Both HeV and NiV have been categorized as Biological Safety Level-4 (BSL-4)
transboundary agents, and NIAID Category C Priority Pathogens. There are six emerging HNVs reported in
recent years, showing limited antigenic cross-reactivity with NiV and HeV. Glycoproteins F and G are the two
only spikes on the HNV surface, which coordinate the viral entry process via G glycoprotein-mediated receptor
attachment followed by the F glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion between virus and host cell. Both G and
F proteins are the targets of HNV-neutralizing antibodies. Vaccine and monoclonal antibody (mAb)
countermeasure development focusing on these two HNV glycoproteins are now of critical and urgent
importance to prepare for potential HNV spillover events. The ectodomain of HNV G glycoprotein is a homo-
tetramer with each protomer composed of a globular head and a stalk region. The metastable tetrameric
conformation has restricted the previous structural characterization of G protein to the monomeric head only,
which is a major obstacle for a comprehensive understanding of the G protein-mediated mechanisms of HNV
entry and antibody recognition. HNV F glycoprotein trimer transits from the prefusion to the post-fusion
conformation during viral entry process. The metastable prefusion conformation can be preferably recognized
by neutralizing antibodies, whereby a promising target for vaccine design and therapeutic development. While
the glycoproteins of both HeV and NiV have been extensively studied, the glycoproteins of the emerging HNVs,
which are genetically and antigenically distinct from the two prototypic HNVs, also extremely diverse among
themselves, have not been well investigated. We have used rational designs to created soluble, stabilized,
oligomeric glycoprotein ectodomain constructs from several emerging HNVs, including two phylogenically distant
bat-borne HNVs, CedPV and AngV, to facilitate structural, functional and antigenicity characterization. We
propose to use structural and structure-based functional analyses of these glycoproteins to assist delineation of
the function of HNV glycoprotein-mediated entry. We will also define the antigenicity of these HNV glycoproteins
with neutralizing antibodies, including conventional murine antibodies and camelid single-domain antibodies, to
investigate their neutralization epitopes and mechanisms structurally and functionally. The combined antigenicity
results will render a comprehensive definition of sites of vulnerability on both G and F glycoproteins of the
emerging HNVs. Collectively, findings derived from this project will provide insights to HNV entry mechanism, as
well as inform future work on designing envelope glycoprotein-based vaccine and immunotherapeutic against
emerging HNVs."

Since 2008, the Pathology Shared Resource (PSR) has been providing Colorado researchers with access to a
full spectrum of expertise in biobanking, pathology, histology, molecular pathology, and cytogenetics, leveraging
the clinical infrastructure and research enterprise at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus (CU
AMC). The PSR is a regional resource and receives funding and other support from the CU AMC, the University
of Colorado Cancer Center, and the Department of Pathology. Services provided by the PSR include archival
and real-time biospecimen collection and management, clinical trial support, and access to annotated
biospecimens. The PSR provides histology and immunohistochemistry services on animal and human tissue
specimens, CLIA-level molecular testing, and analysis for cancer genomic aberrations at chromosomal and
whole genome levels to support basic, translational, and clinical research projects. The PSR, overseen by a
strong collaborative team of researchers and clinical pathologists, is fully equipped to support the logistics and
management of institutional and multi-institutional clinical trials including investigator-initiated trials. The PSR
also manages the large Surgical Pathology archive that contains formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
biospecimens obtained from diagnostic and surgical procedures performed at the University of Colorado Hospital
(UCH). Many research studies utilize specimens from the Surgical Pathology Archive. Most projects require
analysis of a prepared tissue section on a glass slide to be analyzed by immunohistochemistry or other methods.
Analyzing large tissue cohorts using individual sections on individual glass slides is labor intensive, costly, and
can introduce experimental variation. Tissue microarrays (TMA) are created by taking small tissue areas
(cores) from a donor FFPE block and combining it with tissue areas (cores) from other donor blocks in a single
recipient block to make it possible to analyze many different tissue specimens (up to hundreds) simultaneously
on a single glass slide cut from the TMA block, reducing labor time, cost, and experimental variability. The PSR
has manual TMA building capabilities, but manual construction has its limitations as it is labor intensive. Currently
we cannot provide the level of support needed for TMA design and construction to the research community. This
proposal request funding for the purchase of the TMA Grand Master instrument which is capable of fully
automated TMA construction that will greatly enhance our TMA building capabilities and decreasing our workflow
time. In addition, the TMA instrument has excellent data and image tracking features which would greatly improve
our study design, rigor, and quality of obtained data, and data management capabilities. An added benefit is that
many tissue sections (100-200+) can be derived from a single TMA block that can be utilized in different research
projects as an off-the-shelf solution and thereby expediting research and reducing analysis costs. Modernization
of our TMA building capabilities by implementing the automated TMA Grand Master instrument in the CU PSR
will greatly improve, streamline, and modernize our workflows and expedite services to the research community."
10986852,"Endoscopic optical imaging has the potential for providing critical clinical imaging feedback for a variety of lumi-
nal organs, with notable applications identified in the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems.
A significant drawback of optical endoscopes with side-viewing distal optics is that they must be mechanically
rotated in order to obtain a complete 360 degree picture of the organ being imaged. Arguably, this fact serves
as the biggest impediment to realizing the full potential of endoscopic optical imaging: in addition to the com-
promises one has to make in terms of distal optics, the mechanical rotation of the imaging endoscope entails
serious drawbacks for researchers, clinicians, and commercial enterprises engaged in the imaging modality.
Though difficult to manufacture and subject to far too frequent degradation and outright breakage, perhaps the
biggest issues with mechanically rotated imaging endoscopes are the hard limit mechanical rotation imposes on
image acquisition speed and the difficulty or inability to integrate certain highly valuable functional and contrast
enhancing techniques such as elastography and polarimetry. These facts point to an outdated, stagnant design
that is deeply in need of reinvention. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a novel optical endoscope
that does not need to be rotated to perform 360 degree imaging. The practical advantages of our proposed en-
doscope include increased clinical utility and appeal, widely broadened research possibilities, and the establish-
ment of a clear direction for future optical endoscope research. The aims for this proposal are as follows.
Specific Aim 1 focuses on the design and development of the novel metasurface that will enable passive mod-
ulation of the transmitted beam direction. The metasurface will encode in its nanostructures a large number of
independent holograms that are each individually selective for specific beam parameters and are engineered to
transmit the beam at a unique angle along a complete circle. The metasurface will additionally encode a holo-
graphic lens, eliminating the need for bulk lenses in the distal optical assembly. Characterization of the fabri-
cated metasurface will focus on aspects such as beam profile and spot size, selectivity, and efficiency.
Specific Aim 2 incorporates the metasurface from Aim 1 into a fiber optic endoscope design that utilizes a 360
degree reflecting element for redirecting the holographically-selected beam along a direction nearly perpendic-
ular to the endoscope axis for luminal imaging. Optical characterization will be performed similarly to as in Aim
1, accounting for the combined result of the metasurface and reflector. These tests will be complemented by ex
vivo imaging of airway segments to assess imaging performance."

Structural alterations in brain networks are driven by changes in cortical microstructure, including
neuronal death, the disappearance or rewiring of a synapse, and glial changes like decreases in myelination or
astrocytic swelling. Disentangling cell-type specific signatures using accessible tools, such as in vivo MRI, and
determining how signatures of microstructure vary across individuals, is an important objective for the
advancement of mechanistic understanding of age-related decline and developing clinically relevant biomarkers.
Such work requires a more accurate “ground truth” mapping of brain networks and their cellular composition
using specialized analysis techniques to integrate multi-scale whole brain models. For this study, we propose to
investigate network architecture across scale – from cellular-level microstructure to network based structural
connectivity to better understand the unique demands of healthy aging. We will use carefully aligned multi-scale
reference data of rhesus macaque that includes multi-parametric in vivo MRI, high-resolution ex vivo MRI, and
histological markers of neuronal cell bodies (Nissl), myelination (Gallyas), astrocytes (GFAP), and microglial
(Iba-1). We will perform a whole brain network analysis to first establish the morphological and microstructural
signatures of regions connected by long-range anatomical projections. We hypothesize that regions connected
over long distances experience high neural and metabolic demand, leading to accelerated age-related decline.
We will investigate age-related decline in these cortical areas using a normative cohort of n=28 middle to older
aged adult macaques (equivalent to 25-80+ human years). The aims of this project will contribute towards the
development of a highly translational nonhuman primate reference data and network-based analyses for lifespan
health research, enhancing our ability to interpret multiscale features of the aging brain to allow for future
mechanistic studies that cannot be completed in humans."

Clostridioides difficile infections begin when its metabolically dormant spores encounter germinants in the
vertebrate gut and initiate the process of germination. This process is essential for C. difficile to produce the
vegetative cells that will release toxins and cause disease. Interestingly, distinct mechanisms control C. difficile
germinant signaling relative to most spore-forming bacteria. First, C. difficile spore germination requires two
distinct signals: a bile acid germinant signal must be combined with amino acid and/or Ca2+ co-germinant signals.
Second, C. difficile lacks the transmembrane germinant receptors conserved in almost all spore-forming
receptors and instead uses two soluble pseudoproteases, CspA and CspC, to sense co-germinants and
germinants, respectively. CspA and CspC then go on to activate the CspB protease, which in turn activates a
lytic enzyme responsible for degrading the protective cortex layer of the spore. While CspA and CspC clearly
play key roles in regulating the initiation of germination, precisely how they integrate germinant and co-germinant
signals is poorly understood. We recently discovered that CspA forms a homodimer while CspC and CspA form
a stable heterodimer which is preferred over the CspA homodimer. We solved the crystal structure of the CspA
homodimer and the CspA:CspC heterodimer and identified residues that are predicted to regulate these
interactions. Given that we previously showed that CspA is required for CspC to be stably incorporated into
mature spores, we propose that the CspA:CspC heterodimer is the inactive signaling complex found in dormant
spores and that germinants and co-germinants destabilize the heterodimer. Disruption of the CspA:CspC
heterodimer likely promotes CspA homodimerization and frees CspC to bind and activate CspB, which activates
downstream germination events. In this proposal, I will test this “Partner-Swap” model by identifying residues
that mediate CspA homodimer and CspA:CspC heterodimer binding and determine the impact of mutating these
residues on C. difficile germination. Using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and cytological analyses, I will
also determine the effect of germinants and co-germinants on the stability of the CspA:CspC heterodimer.
Collectively, these analyses will reveal how these critical proteins regulate the initiation of C. difficile germination
and advance our understanding of pseudoenzymes and their responsibility in the regulation of key cellular
processes."

The overall goal of this 5-year R13 grant is to address the substantial underrepresentation of knowledge
production and dissemination by individuals from underrepresented populations in addictions research. [For
the purposes of this application, underrepresented populations include: (a) individuals from underrepresented
and/or structurally minoritized racial and ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, individuals from
disadvantaged backgrounds, and women; (b) individuals from low- and middle-income countries; and (c)
individuals from non-English-speaking countries.] This project will specifically increase the involvement of
individuals from underrepresented populations in the annual meetings of the International Society of Addiction
Journal Editors (ISAJE), an international society which was formed in 2001 to foster collaboration between
addiction journal editors globally. It serves editors, associate editors, reviewers and authors of addiction
journals and offers trainings and resources in addition to an annual meeting. Our long-term goal is to foster
increased participation of underrepresented populations in addiction journal publishing as editors. The current
project builds a foundation for this via proposing to support: (a) in-person attendance of editors from
underrepresented populations at each ISAJE meeting through a travel award; and (b) attendance of a
Keynote Speaker to deliver an address on a topic that is crucial for equity, diversity and inclusion in
addiction publishing at each ISAJE meeting. We will cover meeting attendance costs of five competitively-
selected editors from underrepresented populations including a Keynote Speaker selected from existing
addictions journal editors from underrepresented populations. Meetings over five years are planned to take
place both internationally and domestically in: Lisbon, Portugal, in 2024 (just prior to the Lisbon Addictions
conference); Seattle, USA (2025); Johannesburg, South Africa (2026); Montreal, Canada (2027); and Istanbul,
Turkey (2028). Our meeting will foster increased dissemination of science by and about underrepresented
populations, thereby addressing some of the bias in research published in addiction journals."
10997850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Individuals must predict threats in the environment in order to survive. However, maladaptive threat
computation processes can lead to psychiatric disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder. For threat
predictions to be adaptive, they must be temporally accurate and capable of predicting threats which may be
distant in time. However, the mechanisms underlying predictions involving temporal distance are poorly
understood. The overall aim of this project is to determine the neural substrates underlying learned
encoding of temporal threat proximity and temporally accurate defensive responses to threat.
 I have recently shown that the in the prefrontal cortex, norepinephrine represents a teaching signal
which also encodes proximity of incoming threat. Furthermore, threat-predictive stimuli evoke increases in
prefrontal cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration that persist past the stimulus and to an aversive event, consistent
with temporal linkage of predictive stimulus to outcome. These results are consistent with both the encoding of
temporal information within prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the necessity of PFC for delayed threat prediction.
Taken together, current work on the prediction of distant threat suggests an interplay between norepinephrine
signaling of threat proximity during learning, second messenger linkage of predictive cue to distant
outcome across learning, and encoding of threat proximity in PFC in order to effect accurate defensive
behavior. The proposed project seeks to test this model of threat prediction.
 The proposed project seeks to understand the roles of norepinephrine, second messengers, and
prefrontal neurons in encoding of and effecting behavioral responses to threat proximity. In Aim 1, I will
determine the role of norepinephrine time-to-danger signals in supporting temporally accurate threat
responding and encoding of threat proximity information by prefrontal cortex. I will do so by employing
behavioral optogenetics and in vivo calcium imaging, techniques essential to this work and my future systems
neuroscience studies. In Aim 2, I will determine whether cAMP links temporally distant events during
learning by determining whether sustained cAMP supports delayed threat preparation and elucidating the
effect of temporal distance on threat cAMP. I will use optogenetic manipulation and fluorometry of prefrontal
cAMP to complete these aims, as well as to gain personal expertise in future manipulation and measurement
of second messengers, which are key to learned behavior but highly understudied in vivo. In total, I seek to
understand the neural processes underlying the accurate prediction of threats across timescales.
 The proposed project will accomplish the technical training goals aforementioned, and I will also use
this fellowship for my personal advancement in science communication, teaching, and mentorship within
an environment of technical experts. My sponsors, collaborators, contributors, and research environment are
technically and intellectually equipped to support the proposed training and research under this fellowship."

Skin cancers are the most common cancers in the U.S and often require biopsy for histopathology
confirmation. However, ~70% of biopsies yield benign findings, representing an unnecessary healthcare
burden. Biopsies are also invasive and associated with complications such as bleeding, infections, and scars,
and histopathologic analysis is time-consuming, delaying treatment.
Confocal microscopy (CM) images skin at cellular resolution. Two CM techniques are used to evaluate skin
lesions: reflectance CM (RCM), which is performed noninvasively on intact skin, and ex vivo CM (EVCM),
which allows rapid imaging of fresh ex vivo tissues without time-consuming tissue processing. RCM has better
sensitivity (90–94%) and specificity (82–85%) for skin cancer diagnoses compared with dermoscopy and
reduces benign biopsies by ~75%. Likewise, EVCM can detect residual carcinoma in surgical margins with
high sensitivity of 96.6%% and specificity of 89.2%.
These images are challenging for novices to read, posing a major barrier to their clinical adoption. This is
compounded by a lack of experts and teaching resources in this field. To overcome this barrier, we have
created a CME-accredited Annual Workshop on Confocal Microscopy for Cutaneous Diagnostics at Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK). While the workshop focuses on CM, we will also familiarize attendees
with advances in CM, including multimodal techniques such as full-field optical coherence tomography (FF-
OCT), line-field confocal (LC-OCT), and RCM-OCT. The 2024 two-day workshop will be presented in person
and virtually. We have gathered a world-renowned faculty with expertise in this field and anticipate global
participation based on our previous 6 workshops. The workshop will be interactive, including lectures, hands-
on image acquisition, case discussions, and competitive quizzes. R13 funds will be used to provide
scholarships to attendees from underrepresented groups, women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities to
attend the workshop and undertake an observership at MSK. We will further promote participation by these
groups through our marketing and outreach efforts and by ensuring physical and virtual accessibility. The
workshop’s learning objectives are to: (a) familiarize with underlying optical principles and associated
terminology, (b) recognize features of neoplastic and inflammatory skin lesions, (c) develop skills in acquiring
images, (d) understand to integrate CM in clinical and surgical workflows, and (e) gain familiarity and
applications of novel multi-modal devices. The overall goal of the workshop is to encourage clinicians,
especially those from underrepresented backgrounds, to integrate CM and multimodal devices into clinics."

Telomere dysfunction has emerged as a primary contributor to diseases within the human lung. Over the past
five years, our group has shown that telomere dysfunction limits the proliferative capacity of lung epithelial cells
and renders the lung susceptible to injury. In addition, we have found that the senescent lung epithelium secrets
a number of bioactive proteins that have unexpected roles in physiology and lung repair. Here we extend our
findings to test the centrality of the type II alveolar epithelial cell (AEC2). We build on previous studies that have
investigated the roll of AEC2 in disease pathogenesis and repair of the lung epithelium. Our preliminary data
support the selective loss of AEC2 with age in humans and extensive loss in the context of disease. Based on
these findings, we generated a novel model of chronic AEC2 insufficiency that recapitulates several aspects of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), including a peripheral predilection, depletion of AEC2, and progressive
fibrosis that is eventually lethal. This proposal will extend these findings and explore the hypothesis that chronic
AEC2 insufficiency is a unifying pathologic mechanism in IPF. In aim 1, we comprehensively and unambiguously
map every AEC2 throughout the mouse lifespan including very old mice and examine the changes in spatial
organization of AEC2 with injury using a novel whole organ imaging methodology. In aim 2, we characterize a
novel model of progressive fibrosis in the mouse that is driven by AEC2 insufficiency. We will examine functional,
cellular, and molecular changes throughout development of fibrosis. Aim 3 will test a novel approach to lengthen
telomere based on somatic mutations that are acquired in patients with IPF. Together, these aims will test a
novel hypothesis that unifies the pathologic mechanisms of IPF and generates new tools and resources for the
pulmonary community."
10979671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection causes over 30,000 cancers each year, even though multi-valent
vaccinations for HPV have been available since 2006. Uptake of the vaccine is well below national targets
(80% by 2030) and vaccination rates are not being administered by the recommended age of 13. School
based health centers (SBHCs) are an important setting where medically underserved adolescents can
access preventive health care services. While SBHCs provide access to health care, only 10% of students
on campuses with SBHCs are using their services. Collaborative multilevel interventions are needed to
increase use of SBHCs and improve vaccination uptake among medically underserved adolescents in these
settings. Peer-to-Peer education offers promise in creating collaborative environments between SBHCs and
schools, to increase healthcare access and improve healthy behaviors. Our proposed innovation, PEER, will
tailor messaging to adolescents and parents through a validated engagement approach, Boot Camp
Translation (Aim 1). Then PEER will conduct a multilevel interventional study that uses a stepped-wedge
design to test the effectiveness and implementation of student-, patient-, provider- and school-based
interventions focused on improving use of SBHCs and uptake of HPV vaccination in age-eligible adolescents
(Aim 2). Analysis of mediator and moderators will elucidate the mechanisms of action and identify subgroups
for whom the intervention was more and less effective. PEER will be led by an experienced team of
scientists, clinicians, and community organizations with expertise in implementation science, HPV
vaccination research, and community engagement. PEER will also be overseen by an advisory board made
up of stakeholders including school administration and youth. If successful, PEER could significantly
increase the use of SBHCs, and decrease HPV-associated cancers and, thus, reduce the burden of cancer
in the United States."
10980071,"The anterior intervertebral disc and posterior diarthrodial facet joints form what is referred to the three-joint
complex of the spine, working in concert to resist large magnitude axial loads and constrain range of motion to
non-injurious levels. Degenerative pathology in both spinal structures is a known contributor to back pain, which
has become the number one cause of years lived with disability globally. Intervertebral disc degeneration is
associated with structural and biochemical changes to the disc tissues, which compromise the ability of the disc
to bear load, potentially leading to overloading of the facet joints. The study of disc degeneration has been
dominant in the field for decades, and as such, little is known the pathophysiology of facet osteoarthritis (OA), or
how altered disc mechanical function may contribute to the progression of facet degeneration. This proposal will
bring a new perspective to the study of spinal degeneration by investigating the mechanical crosstalk between
the disc and its adjacent facet joints during degenerative processes and in the scenario of disc repair, using
animal models and human tissues. In Aim 1A, we will first utilize a large animal model to characterize the
progression of facet OA in an initially healthy spine following experimentally induced degeneration of the adjacent
discs. Facet cartilage and subchondral bone pathology will be probed across length scales as a function of disc
degeneration to determine the temporal relationship between disc degeneration and facet OA. In Aim 1B, we
will also utilize human cadaveric tissues to determine how facet pathobiology and disc-facet crosstalk differ in
males versus females, factors less easily studied in large animal models. In both goat experimental and human
cadaveric tissues, we will assess inflammation, innervation and immune cell infiltration into the disc and facet
joint synovium and capsule as surrogate measures of pain and biological dysfunction. Finally, quantitative
structure-function outcomes from both goat and human spinal tissues (Aims 1A and B) will then be utilized to
generate patient/animal-specific finite element models, which will be used to quantify stress distributions in the
facet joints under simulated six degree of freedom physiologic loading to understand mechanistically how altered
disc mechanical function during degeneration may contribute to the progression of facet OA. In Aim 2, we will
then elucidate whether restoring intervertebral disc mechanical function can mitigate the progression of disc
degeneration and facet OA. Using the same large animal model as Aim 1, we will deliver an injectable, granular
hyaluronic acid hydrogel to the degenerative nucleus pulposus to acutely augment disc mechanical properties.
The acute effects of NP augmentation via the granular hydrogel on facet loading will be assessed using the
animal-specific finite element models utilized in Aim 1. The extent of disc repair and concomitant progression of
facet OA in vivo will be assessed across length scales via a variety of structure-function outcomes. Overall, the
knowledge gained from this study of disc-facet crosstalk can contribute to developing advanced diagnostics for
spinal degeneration and elucidating new targets for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies."

Vascular and lymphatic anomalies comprise a spectrum of defects that originate in embryonic blood
or lymphatic vessels and are present at birth. These defects can be congenital or sporadic and nearly
50 genes bearing causative mutations have been identified for both cases. Among these is RASA1,
which encodes a negative regulator of the RAS GTPase that is normally activated by growth factor
signaling. Germline autosomal dominant mutations in RASA1 lead to capillary malformation-
arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) syndrome, in which patients exhibit port wine stains on their
skin at birth. CM-AVM patients also harbor AVMs, which are direct artery/vein connections without an
intervening capillary bed, or lymphatic anomalies. AVMs usually occur in the brain where they have a
significant negative health impact, while the fast-flow nature of AVMs can lead to cardiac overload.
Lymphatic anomalies can perturb fluid clearance, leading to cardiac or pleural effusions, and hydrops
fetalis. Accordingly, AVMs and lymphatic anomalies can contribute to fetal demise or early neonatal
lethality and therapeutic options are limited. Mouse models have provided important insights into the
role of Rasa1 in embryogenesis, including its requirement for vascular and lymphatic development.
However, many defects in Rasa1-deficient mouse embryos are not seen in human CM-AVM lesions
and this model fails to mimic postnatal features of CM-AVM, underscoring the need for additional
animal models. We have developed rasa1-deficient zebrafish embryos and show that they exhibit
defects in both vascular and lymphatic development, including vascular regression defects not
previously noted in other models. Adult zebrafish carriers of mutant rasa1 alleles also show evidence
of presumptive capillary malformations, suggesting that they may exhibit hallmarks of CM-AVM. To
study the role of Rasa1 in zebrafish, we have developed numerous genetic tools, including zebrafish
bearing a floxed rasa1a allele and endothelial Cre driver lines. Using these tools, we will define the
cellular and molecular effects of rasa1 deficiency that give rise to lymphatic defects. In addition, we
will investigate how rasa1 acts to mediate vascular regression and whether defects in this process
contribute to AVM formation. Finally, we will characterize presumptive capillary malformations in
rasa1 carriers, while assessing this model as a platform for preclinical testing of therapeutic small
molecule candidates to alleviate CM-AVM defects. Together, our studies will provide valuable insight
on the embryonic role of Rasa1 in development and how its deficiency contributes to formation of
vascular and lymphatic anomalies."

The degree of cognitive impairment is the best predictor of functional outcomes in schizophrenia, but the
efficacious treatment of these deficits remains a significant challenge. Genome-wide association and exome
sequencing studies point to an essential role for components of the Arc protein complex in glutamatergic
dysregulation in schizophrenia. Studies of synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation suggest that loss of Arc
function may be important in the pathophysiology of cognitive impairments in multiple neuropsychiatric disorders.
These results indicate that targeting Arc may provide a new avenue to improve cognitive impairments in these
disease contexts. To explore the feasibility of this objective, we carried out a high-throughput, image-based
screen in mouse cortical neurons to identify small molecules that potentiated neuronal activity-dependent
induction of Arc at the mRNA and protein level. One of the strongest enhancers of Arc expression was an atypical
antipsychotic, lurasidone, whereas many other antipsychotics were inactive. Consistent with the potential unique
properties of lurasidone, human clinical studies suggest that lurasidone can improve cognitive performance in
schizophrenia. Moreover, in preclinical behavioral studies, lurasidone ameliorates the learning and memory
impairment induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Based on these observations, we hypothesize
that differential modulation of Arc in cortical glutamatergic neurons by lurasidone is the basis for its
pro-cognitive effects. We will test this hypothesis by first deriving a quantitative structure-activity relationship
that allows for the optimization of Arc enhancement using our chemical synthesis and high-content neuronal
imaging platform. Building on our strong preliminary data demonstrating the conservation of lurasidone’s
enhancement of Arc expression in human iPSC-derived cortical neurons and lurasidone’s ability to increase
dendritic spine density deficits in these neurons, we will profile a focused collection of lurasidone derivatives with
strong preliminary data demonstrating the feasibility of successfully doing so. To extend this functional
characterization, we will use cerebral organoids from existing schizophrenia and matched healthy iPSCs to
determine their response to Arc-enhancing compounds at the level of single-cell transcriptomes, dendritic spine
density, and electrophysiological profiles using multielectrode array technology. Finally, to connect to clinical
studies, systematic characterization of iPSC-derived neurons from our existing cohort of first-episode
schizophrenia patients who show significant cognitive improvement with lurasidone compared to patients who
are lurasidone non-responders will be performed to provide mechanistic insights into Arc and cellular phenotypes
that correlate with cognitive enhancement and differential patient response. Successful completion of these
studies will result in a more precise understanding of the role of Arc in neuroplasticity, provide novel
pharmacological probes, and create a unique collection of iPSC models from first-episode psychosis patients
that can be used to probe the neural substrates underlying cognitive deficits and lurasidone treatment response."
10995183,"Over 85% of individuals 18 years and older within the United States (US) consume alcohol. More importantly, a
staggering 25.8% and 6.3% are classified by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism criteria as
binge or heavy drinkers, respectively, making alcohol the 3rd leading cause of preventable death. Chronic heavy
drinking (CHD) increases the incidence of heart disease, stroke, cancer, and alcoholic liver disease. CHD is also
associated with heightened susceptibility to bacterial/viral pathogens and tissue repair mechanisms, suggesting
alcohol consumption negatively impacts the immune system. Indeed, studies from our group and others have
reported functional, transcriptional, and epigenetic modifications in peripheral monocytes and tissue-resident
macrophages with CHD, skewing them toward a hyper-inflammatory phenotype while impairing pathogen
defense mechanisms. Despite the significant contribution of aberrant monocyte/macrophage responses to CHD-
induced organ injury, no studies to date have investigated the effects of abstinence and post-abstinence drinking
on these critical cells. Organs and organ systems after alcohol consumption (brain, liver, lung) are challenging
to interrogate throughout repeated bouts of abstinence and post-abstinence drinking. Since circulating
monocytes are precursors of some tissue-resident macrophages, investigating the effects of abstinence and
relapse on circulating monocytes will provide greater insight into how CHD dysregulates organs and organ
systems. In this application, we will leverage a rhesus macaque model of voluntary ethanol self-administration
to test the hypothesis that CHD induces persistent functional, transcriptional, and epigenetic changes in
peripheral monocytes that are not reversed by short periods of abstinence and are exacerbated by
repeated bouts of abstinence and post-abstinence drinking. This hypothesis will be tested using a multi-
pronged approach using multiplex ELISA, flow cytometry, single cell omics, and metabolic assays after a 28-day
abstinence and post-abstinence drinking episodes. These experiments will provide deeper insight into the
persistence of CHD-induced immune modifications in complex organs and organ systems. This understanding
could identify novel druggable targets that decrease alcohol cravings or organ damage/opportunistic infections
that occur after CHD."

Climate change, exacerbated by urbanization, is escalating extreme heat globally, posing significant threats to
human health, particularly among vulnerable demographic groups. This study addresses critical gaps in
understanding daily heat exposure of vulnerable urban residents, specifically pregnant women. While previous
research has linked increased temperatures to adverse pregnancy outcomes, this study aims to extend that work
in order to unravel complex interactions between hyperlocal (neighborhood) heat exposure, social determinants
of health (SDoH), and adaptive behaviors among pregnant women in Miami, Florida. Epidemiological evidence
underscores associations between extreme heat exposure and negative pregnancy-related outcomes. Census
data, typically used in existing studies, overlooks hyperlocal heat conditions such as indoor/outdoor home
temperatures and neighborhood temperature. Miami's temperatures often exceed official National Weather
Service measurements. Leveraging hyperlocal assessments, this study investigates the effects of this extreme
heat on maternal and pregnancy health outcomes. The proposed longitudinal pilot study, embedded in an
established pregnancy cohort, aims to achieve two specific aims. The first aim seeks to examine the moderating
role of SDoH (e.g., neighborhood/housing quality, and economic hardship) on the interactions between heat
exposure and maternal/pregnancy health outcomes (psychological stress, low birth weight, and preterm birth.)
The hypothesis posits that higher hyperlocal heat exposure will be associated with poorer neighborhood/housing
quality and greater economic hardship and will negatively affect maternal and pregnancy health outcomes. The
second aim focuses on identifying heat adaptive behaviors (e.g. HVAC usage, decreased step count) adopted
by pregnant women to mitigate the risks of heat exposure in context of SDoH. The hypothesis suggests that heat
adaptive behaviors, such as reduced step count in warmer months and increased air-conditioning use, will
mitigate the risks of heat exposure. This study contributes to the understanding of local heat exposure effects
on pregnancy, emphasizing the need for effective and equitable adaptations. By aligning with the Social
Determinants of Health framework and the National Institute of Nursing Research's strategic plan, this research
aims to inform future interventions and policies. The proposed F31 award provides the researcher with
opportunity to develop essential skills in both maternal health and climate health research, paving the way for
future postdoctoral opportunities and a career as an independent nurse researcher."
10997769,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mechanisms that integrate local and systemic cues to precisely regulate stem-cell based tissue renewal remain
unclear, particularly in the rapidly cycling gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium. A pair of transcriptional coactivator
proteins that promote growth and intestinal stem cell renewal – the Hippo pathway protein YAP1 and the nuclear
receptor (NR) interactor NCOA3 – are each implicated in the progression of colorectal cancers. Both of these
factors have orthologs in the common fruit fly, D. melanogaster, which combines robust fertility, rapid generation
time, a relatively simple genome, and an extensive genetic toolbox to make this system a powerful model to
investigate gut renewal mechanisms. Components of the mammalian Hippo and NR pathways have homologs
in D. melanogaster, including the nuclear coactivator proteins Yorkie (Yki; YAP1 in humans) and Taiman (Tai;
nuclear receptor coactivator-3, NCOA3 in humans). Prior studies established that (i) Yki and Tai physically
interact through respective WW (tryptophan-tryptophan) domains and PPxY (proline-proline-x-tyrosine) motifs,
(ii) Tai modulates Yki-driven overgrowth of fly larval epithelia, and (iii) Tai and Yki each play a role in intestinal
stem cell (ISC) proliferation. Based on this and other evidence, we hypothesize that the cooperativity of the
Tai/NR and Yki/Hippo complex regulates ISC renewal by activating a unique set of target genes distinct from
canonical Tai/NR or Yki/Hippo targets. We generated a critical tool to test this hypothesis: a CRISPR mutant fly
stock in which the PPxY motifs of endogenous Tai are converted to PPxA, blocking Tai’s binding to Yki. These
viable homozygous mutants (taiPPxA/taiPPxA) allow precise and selective decoupling of the Tai/NR and Yki/Hippo
pathways in vivo. This proposal will investigate how Hippo and NR signaling converge on the Yki-Tai interaction
to activate transcription of genes required for gut renewal using D. melanogaster midgut as a model via the
following specific aims: Aim 1 will define the distribution of intestinal cell types and mitotic activity in taiPPxA/taiPPxA
mutant and control flies following acute intestinal injury; Aim 2 will define effects of taiPPxA on gene expression
and chromatin accessibility during intestinal renewal to identify Yki-Tai target genes that are activated during
injury induced ISC renewal. The findings of this study will provide insight into how two systemic signaling
pathways, Hippo and NR, converge on their downstream transcriptional targets, Yki/YAP1 and Tai/NCOA3, to
regulate local ISC-dependent tissue renewal."
10998805,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Noroviruses are a top cause of acute gastroenteritis globally, and no approved norovirus vaccine exists. The
norovirus capsid protein plays key roles in virus attachment and entry into host cells and is the target of
neutralizing antibodies. Recent genomics and serological studies predict the presence of a new antigenic site,
named antigenic site G, and suggest that it became immunodominant during the emergence of the most recent
GII.4 norovirus variant outbreak, revealing a novel mechanism for virus evolution immune escape. However, the
molecular interactions of neutralizing antibodies targeting this immunodominant site on the norovirus capsid have
not been described. Our goal is to define the epitopes that are recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies
targeting the immunodominant antigenic site G on the norovirus capsid and to directly visualize and map antibody
immunodominance in serum antibodies targeting past and current norovirus variants. Using an integrated
structural and biophysical approach, we will pursue two specific aims to (1) Define the epitopes of neutralizing
monoclonal antibodies targeting the norovirus capsid antigenic site G and (2) Directly visualize the chronological
shift in antibody immunodominance towards antigenic site G. Results obtained by this work will provide a
molecular roadmap for the development of novel norovirus vaccine immunogens that broadly protect against
norovirus infection and disease."

Osteosarcoma (OS) is a common and devastating primary bone tumor affecting both humans and canines.
Histotripsy is an emerging non-thermal ablation modality that uses high-pressure focused ultrasound pulses to
induce acoustic cavitation and liquify target tissue with high precision. Our team has pioneered the development
of histotripsy for bone tumors with critical ex vivo and in vivo studies using excised canine OS tumors and pet
dogs with spontaneous OS, respectively. Dogs have an increased incidence of OS with high similarity to human
OS, allowing the pet dog to serve as a valuable comparative oncology model. This proposal seeks to further the
development of histotripsy for OS treatment by 1) investigating the treatment parameters & strategies needed
for complete ablation in ex vivo canine OS, and 2) testing these strategies in pilot clinical trials with acute and
chronic follow-up of pet dogs with histotripsy-treated OS. Throughout these experiments, I will be trained in vital
skills in bio-engineering and clinical oncology, including transmit-receive circuitry (Dr. Tim Hall at University of
Michigan), histopathological analysis of ablation (Dr. Sheryl Coutermarsh-Ott at Virginia-Maryland College of
Veterinary Medicine), and radiological assessment of ablation (Dr. Tim Ziemlewicz at University of Wisconsin).
The results of this work will overcome previous technical & engineering barriers in achieving complete ablation
of bone tumors and will provide crucial safety & feasibility data to guide and inform the clinical translation of
histotripsy as a non-invasive limb salvage treatment for OS."
10975982,"Title: Effectiveness of Concurrent Care to Improve Pediatric and Family Outcomes at End of Life
This grant proposal represents a first competitive renewal (Cycle 2) of a highly productive, NINR-funded
research program investigating a health policy intervention for children and adolescents with serious illness.
The Cycle 1 research question was whether pediatric concurrent care (simultaneous hospice and medical
care) affected pediatric and family outcomes. A significant increase in fragmented care transitions and a high
risk of adverse outcomes was identified, along with a cohort of rural children and adolescents significantly
affected by this care environment. In response, Medicaid programs in several states ushered in transitional
care regulations (TCR) for pediatric concurrent care that mandated collaborative team efforts from nurses,
physicians, pharmacists, child life specialists, and other health care professionals to support and coordinate
pediatric end-of-life care across settings during concurrent care. In Cycle 2, the proposed policy effectiveness
project focuses on advancing pediatric health policy and health equity by examining this policy modification
within a rural cohort. The project’s specific aims are to: (1) estimate the effect of the TCR intervention on rural
children’s end-of-life health (i.e., functioning) and health care (i.e., resource use, spending); (2) identify a
subgroup of disadvantaged rural children using innovative machine learning methods; (3) examine potential
mechanisms and pathways that may inform further policy improvement strategies important to rural children
and families. These aims will be achieved by conducting a multi-level natural experiment with a difference-in-
difference analysis, supervised and unsupervised machine learning, and mediation and moderation analysis.
The project team has the expertise in pediatric concurrent care, data science and statistical analysis. Practice
partner includes the National Network of Pediatric Palliative Care Coalitions. The project is innovative because
it advances the understudies area of policy-focused effectiveness science. The project is significant and will
have an impact because it focuses on a major policy modification and because it will generate knowledge to
inform rural health care for children. The project is aligned with NINR’s Strategic Plan, which prioritizes social
determinants of health such as rurality, health equity for underserved rural children, and systems and models
of care."
10977244,"Project Summary
Mammalian embryos have the potential to develop both male and female reproductive tract organs. However,
they typically only differentiate one sex type depending on the presence or absence of fetal gonadal hormones.
Two paired epithelial ducts form within the mesonephroi (fetal kidneys) in both genetically male and female
embryos. The Wolffian ducts form first and with the adjacent mesenchyme differentiate into male organs,
including the vasa deferens, epididymis, and seminal vesicle. The Müllerian ducts then form adjacent to the
Wolffian ducts. The Müllerian ducts and their adjacent mesenchyme give rise to female organs, including oviduct,
uterus, vagina. In male embryos, the testes secrete testosterone to induce the differentiation of the Wolffian
ducts. The testes also secrete anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) that binds receptors expressed in the mesenchyme
adjacent to the Müllerian duct, resulting in elimination of the Müllerian duct epithelium. Alterations in Wolffian
and Müllerian duct formation or differentiation to a male or female phenotype lead to Differences of Sex
Development (DSD). DSDs are conditions that vary from the typical male and female phenotypes. In female
embryos, once the two Müllerian ducts have elongated and connected to the urogenital sinus the posterior
regions migrate to the midline and fuse to create the bipartite uterus in the mouse and simplex uterus in human.
Alterations in these processes are thought to lead to defects in uterine morphogenesis, associated with infertility,
high risk pregnancy, and miscarriage. Much progress has been made in understanding the development of the
female reproductive tract organs and the elimination of the Müllerian system in male embryos but there are still
many basic questions to be answered. Wnt7a encodes a secreted protein that is expressed in the Müllerian duct
epithelium. We have discovered that the Müllerian ducts of Wnt7a-null females do not fuse at the midline,
resulting in the formation of two separate uterine horns and two vaginal openings, i. e. a duplex uterus. This
suggests that WNT7A-induced genes are required for Müllerian fusion. In males, the Müllerian ducts must be
eliminated by AMH. No discrete cis-regulatory elements have been identified for Müllerian duct epithelium- or
mesenchyme-specific transcription. Previously, we identified Osterix (Osx) as an AMH-induced gene expressed
in the male Müllerian duct mesenchyme. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that a 39 kb region surrounding
the Osx locus contains Müllerian duct mesenchyme transcriptional regulatory sequences. Little is known about
the factors that establish the competence of the Müllerian duct mesenchyme to AMH for the elimination of the
epithelial ducts during male differentiation. We have preliminary results that indicate that the tumor suppressor
gene Wt1 may be one of these factors. This proposal focuses on Müllerian biology to determine the
molecular, cellular, and developmental mechanisms that regulate female reproductive tract
morphogenesis, Müllerian duct transcription, and the elimination of the Müllerian system during male
differentiation."

Sterilization of tuberculosis (TB) requires lengthy chemotherapy treatment to eradicate persister Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) sub-populations. Persister Mtb are unaffected by anti-TB treatment due to their viable but non-
replicating (VBNR) or slowly replicating state in the absence of heritable genetic changes. Persistence is a
reversible phenotype which may be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. DNA methylation contributes to the
formation of persister bacteria in other bacterial species, but the role for DNA methylation remains unknown in
Mtb persister formation. The objective of this K43 award is to establish the role of DNA methylation in the Mtb
stress response and in the formation of Mtb heterogeneity, which includes the persister sub-population. The
primary mentorship of Drs. Sampson (LMIC primary mentor) and Aldrige (USA primary mentor), both
experienced in mycobacteriology, will provide critical career advancement training. Drs. Sampson and Aldridge
have both contributed to advancing our understanding of Mtb population heterogeneity by developing a
replication reporter plasmid for the identification of Mtb persisters and a microfluidic imaging platform to
investigate cell-to-cell heterogeneity, respectively. This project will build on these advances to address two
specific aims: (1) demonstrate a role for DNA methylation in the Mtb stress response and phenotypic drug
resistance, and (2) demonstrate a role for DNA methylation in Mtb persistence and antibiotic tolerance. This
study will for the first time show that DNA methylation results in changes on a protein level. We will show that
DNA methylation is used by Mtb to respond to environmental stress and promote the formation of a persister
sub-population. Phenotypic drug susceptibility testing and killing assays will assess the impact of DNA
methylation on the ability of Mtb to tolerate antibiotic exposure. Population and single-cell imaging analysis will
assess the impact of DNA methylation on Mtb population heterogeneity, which has previously been shown to
impact treatment efficacy.
At the end of this K43-funded mentored study, the applicant will establish herself as an independently funded TB
research scientist and group leader at Stellenbosch University. Interdisciplinary collaborations established during
this award will lay the foundation for future investigations into the prevention of Mtb persisters for shorter TB
treatment, the identification of biomarkers for diagnosis of persister infections, and prevention of TB recurrence."
10977600,"ABSTRACT. Despite the significant increase in overdose-related deaths in the past decade, there continues to
be a substantial gap in getting services to the individuals who need it most, particularly for individuals with
polysubstance use in rural areas. To bridge this gap, clinical research and services must incorporate
perspectives of individuals with polysubstance use in rural areas—voices that are often neglected from the
research process and care delivery decisions. This proposal builds upon our team’s expertise in developing
patient research advisory boards to advance addiction treatment by developing a novel patient engagement
resource center (ARTEMIS: Advancing Addiction Research and Treatment through Engagement with Rural
Marylanders Impacted by PolySubstance Use). This proposal is directly responsive to patient feedback to create
a novel patient engagement resource center focused on improving services for individuals with polysubstance
use in rural areas. Our team has conducted preliminary work, including to: (1) establish an urban Research
Advisory Committee of individuals with lived experience of substance use to inform and accelerate addiction
research; and (2) capture patient-defined barriers to treatment and successful treatment outcomes. Our
interdisciplinary team at UMD has a strong history of collaboration with communities and patients, including
five rural county health departments, and has established an innovative network of clinical services throughout
rural Maryland, including a unique mobile telemedicine unit offering telemedicine buprenorphine prescribing and
peer recovery services. We have created a framework for peer-focused clinical research at these sites, led by MPIs
Kattakuzhy and Magidson (R01DA057443), offering an opportunity to build upon this infrastructure for ARTEMIS.
The overall aim is to establish a sustainable patient engagement resource center to advance patient-centered,
integrated care models for polysubstance use in rural areas. Specific aims are to: 1) Form a patient advisory
committee and consultation model focused on individuals with polysubstance use in rural areas, guided by the
Framework for Continuous Patient and Stakeholder Engagement in Patient Centered Outcomes Research
(PCOR); 2) Evaluate patient experiences with polysubstance use care delivery in rural areas to document
perceived barriers, preferences and strategies for improving service delivery; 3) Conduct pilot projects designed
in partnership with the PAC, with a proposed focus on: a) Understanding patient experiences of polysubstance
use, including intentions for and patterns of use; and b) Identifying strategies for addressing social determinants
of health and improving functional outcomes. These pilot studies were guided by our team’s preliminary research
and patient input, and the study designs will ultimately be based on feedback from Aims 1 and 2. ARTEMIS will
leverage the team’s unique strengths to engage in meaningful dialogue with patients with polysubstance use to
create a national model for urban-rural academic-community partnerships, and re-center the patient experience
of polysubstance use in clinical research and treatment."

The project aims to incorporate emerging technologies in genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics and
proteomics for the analyses of advanced, rare, and pediatric cancers. The project has an additional
emphasis on translating the results from these new approaches into clinically actionable information
through the development of reportable test results in a CLIA clinical testing lab. The proposal will
leverage the capabilities and resources of the Mi-OncoSeq CLIA precision oncology lab, first
established in 2013. The Mi-OncoSeq lab has sequenced over ten thousand patient samples to date
with integrated analyses of tumor RNA, tumor DNA, and matched normal DNA.
This project will incorporate long-read and methylation sequencing, using Nanopore technology as a
complement to the existing panel of assays available based on Illumina short-read technology. The
laboratory operates a Promethion 24 from Oxford Nanopore in pursuit of these goals. The laboratory
is developing improved and accelerated bioinformatic pipelines for use in clinical testing labs. Overall,
these new technologies and analytical methods will be applied to our cohorts of advanced, rare and
pediatric cancers for improved clinical reporting to aid diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic decision-
making. Specific areas of research will include the roles of imprinting, structural rearrangement,
intergenic mutation, and promoter swapping in the development of these cancers and their mechanisms
of therapy resistance."

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), caused by excessive alcohol consumption, is a growing public health
problem with a significant impact on the global population. In the United States, ALD is now a cause of rising
liver-related mortality, especially among younger patients.
 Despite this severity, there are currently no FDA-approved therapies. The absence of consensus on
optimal drug targets or strategies underscores gaps in our mechanistic understanding of disease drivers.
While animal models have greatly contributed to our understanding of ALD pathogenesis, their utility and
clinical relevance remain a subject of debate. To enhance diagnostic capabilities and advance effective
therapeutics, it is imperative to establish reliable human-relevant models that mimic the liver's response to
disease-specific challenges. The increasing number of genetic variants associated with ALD susceptibility
further underscores the necessity for human-relevant systems.
 To address these limitations, we devised a human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived model
for ALD research, capitalizing on a multicellular in vitro liver culture system recently pioneered in our lab.
Within this multicellular setup, we co-cultivated hiPSC-derived hepatocytes, macrophages, and hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs), mirroring the intricate dynamics of liver physiology in both health and disease. Our
investigations unveiled that subjecting the liver culture to clinically relevant blood-alcohol concentrations
successfully replicated many pivotal alcohol (EtOH)-induced and endotoxin (i.e., LPS)-mediated ALD features.
Deeper scrutiny of hepatocytes over time revealed a macrophage-mediated upregulation of hepatic progenitor
markers, a dedifferentiation phenotype frequently observed in ALD patients. Furthermore, the liver cultures
exhibited a heightened reaction to EtOH/LPS than EtOH or LPS alone, especially in terms of HSC activation.
Subsequent investigation unveiled that EtOH exposure sensitized HSCs to LPS stimulation and TGFβ-
induced activation, revealing a previously unexplored mechanism underlying ALD pathogenesis.
 Across three aims, employing cell and molecular approaches, we capitalize on the unique features of
this platform to address questions that cannot be sufficiently explored through existing ex vivo human-relevant
systems. We focus on our working hypothesis, postulating that activated macrophages induce hepatocyte
dedifferentiation through the secretion of soluble factors (Aim 1), and that EtOH exposure elicits changes in
specific genes and pathways, contributing to the heightened sensitivity of HSCs to LPS and TGFβ (Aim 2).
Aim 3 seeks to unravel the roles of a genetic risk factor (i.e., rs738409 C>G variant in PNPLA3), in ALD
development. These efforts will pave the way for more precise therapeutic interventions and targeted
treatments. A better comprehension of the genetic influencers of ALD risk has the potential to enhance the
identification of at-risk populations and fortify disease prevention strategies."
10977978,"Through lived experiences and my position as an adolescent medicine physician, I have witnessed the lifelong
consequences that disparities in health outcomes impose on vulnerable adolescents and young adults (AYAs).
This has fueled my long-term goal of developing interventions that empower AYAs, providers, and adults who
support AYA acquisition of skills that positively impact all aspects of sexual health, including HIV prevention.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV, a daily or intermittently dosed oral pill, has been shown to be a highly
effective biomedical tool for preventing HIV infection. However, the benefits of PrEP have not been experienced
equally among all populations with HIV acquisition risk. In particular, PrEP use and adherence rates are low
among Blacks, especially Black adolescents and young adults (AYAs), which may explain the disproportionate
rates of HIV in many Black communities. Although there are many barriers to PrEP use and adherence among
Blacks, including low perception of risk; challenges adhering to a pill regimen and visit schedule; and HIV- and
sex-related stigma, few solutions have been shown to improve PrEP use in this population, especially among
Black AYAs. An intervention that increases PrEP adherence may be of particular importance for Black AYAs in
the Deep South, particularly in states such as Alabama, which has been named a geographic hotspot in the
Department of Health and Human Service’s Ending the HIV Epidemic 10-year plan. Grounded in Social Cognitive
Theory, and building on previously published data, this proposed study will integrate AYA-trusted adult social
support dyadic communication with an existing mobile Health (mHealth) app–the HealthMpowerment app–to
facilitate increased PrEP use and adherence among Black AYAs in the Deep South. As more than half of new
HIV infections in Alabama occur in rural communities, we will collaborate with community partners within urban
and rural areas and create two community advisory boards, one with Black AYAs and one with adults providing
support to Black AYAs, to ensure this app fits the needs of urban and rural Black AYAs. Specifically, this multi-
methods study will use qualitative interviews and discrete choice experiment surveys to identify 1) trusted adults
Black AYAs would ideally partner with, 2) what information trusted adult supports would need to support Black
AYAs in PrEP adherence, and 3) app features that Black AYAs and their trusted adult supports feel would best
support dyadic communication around AYA PrEP use. After adaptation, the app will be piloted by Black AYAs
14 to 21 years old to inform an application for R34 funding of a larger pilot study. If validated in future clinical
trials, this intervention could prove helpful in alleviating disparities in HIV incidence. In addition to providing a
tailored health intervention, the comprehensive experiential training, expert mentorship and advising, and critical
didactic coursework embodied in this rigorous proposal will build on my clinical expertise and strong background
building community partnerships and provide the additional skills I need to become a leader in the development
of health behavior interventions focused on reducing disparities in sexual and reproductive health outcomes."

The outstanding training environment in muscle disease pathogenesis and treatment that exists in Columbus,
Ohio at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH) and The Ohio State University (OSU) today is difficult to rival
and arguably unsurpassed in any other city of the world. In addition to being an epicenter for gene therapy of
neuromuscular disease, Columbus is also home to a remarkable number of scientists and clinicians (in the
OSU/NCH Center of Muscle Health and Neuromuscular Diseases) that have for years been providing key
leadership and training for trainees at all levels. Trainees include high school students (NCH Futures Matter
program for underrepresented and underprivileged students); undergraduate/post-bac students (OSU
Discovery PREP program to assist underrepresented minorities in gaining admittance to post-graduate
schools); graduate students and post-docs (a NIH T32 training program at OSU and the NCH Research
Institute Trainee Association, RITA); and early-stage physician scientists at NCH/OSU in Neurology and Gene
Therapy (neuromuscular fellowships). This training milieu in Columbus provided the foundation for the
emergence of the NCH/OSU Myology Course, which was initiated in 2012 under the leadership of Dr. Kevin
Flanigan (overall PI of this Wellstone application), and has been operating yearly ever since. Dr. Flanigan led
a grassroots effort of Muscle Center faculty to develop this program, which accepts approximately 60 trainees
per year for an intensive one-week course that includes morning lectures followed by afternoon wet lab
electives (for PhD trainees) or clinical training (for MDs). To date, more than 700 trainees have attended this
course, with many continuing on to high profile roles in muscle research. Attendees have come from 9

 Early life exposure to microbes is necessary for normal immune development, and clinical studies link
alterations in early life bacterial composition to subsequent development of inflammatory disorders such as
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and atopy such as asthma and dermatitis. In intestinal disease, microbiota-
specific T cells can drive tissue pathology. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the homeostatic mechanisms
that establish immune tolerance to commensal microbes during infancy in order to address inflammation in
adulthood. As antigen presenting cells (APCs) initiate the T-cell response, we want to elucidate how they respond
to microbes during early life. This work will have broad implications for development of therapies that address
the root of inflammatory disease including reshaping of pathogenic T cell responses.
 The proposed project aims to describe how microbial colonization during early life drives the phenotype
and function of mononuclear phagocytes (MNP), which are a lineage of APCs known to coordinate host-microbe
responses. This lineage consists of monocytes that circulate in the blood, and the dendritic cells (DC) and
macrophages that they differentiate into upon entering tissue. While the factors that dictate this fate decision
remain undefined, these diverging cell fates lead to functionally different outcomes. DCs migrate to lymph nodes
to initiate T-cell responses while macrophages remain resident in the tissue to clear microbes and support barrier
function. Data from our lab shows that in early life but not adulthood, intestinal DCs expand and bring microbial
antigens to the thymus where they induce proliferation of microbe-specific T-cells. Interestingly in the early life
mesenteric lymph node, we see similar DC expansion and microbial trafficking but do not see the corresponding
T-cell response. This data led to our hypothesis that during early life, mononuclear phagocyte differentiation is
skewed towards a DC fate. We further hypothesize that early life lymphoid organs provide signals to instruct
microbial antigen processing and presentation resulting in life span and organ restriction of expansion of
microbiota recognizing T cells.
 To address our hypothesis, in Aim 1 we will utilize single-cell RNA sequencing and adoptive monocyte
transfer to understand cell intrinsic and tissue regulation of monocyte fate over the lifespan. In Aim 2, by using
functional readouts, we will interrogate changes in DC function over the lifespan. Together, our work will reveal
how MNPs mediate T-cell responses to microbes during development, further advancing our ability to address
inflammation during adulthood."
10998726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Following spinal cord injury (SCI) at or above thoracic level 6 (T6), descending supraspinal control over
the spinal neurons associated with sympathetic function is severed. This, along with plasticity within these
neurons themselves, results in exaggerated sympathetic reflexes known as sympathetic hyperreflexia. This
increase in sympathetic activity following SCI causes severe dysfunction of organs receiving sympathetic input,
such as the spleen and vasculature. This contributes to cardiovascular disease and immune dysfunction, two
leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the SCI population. Therefore, increasing understanding of the
mechanisms underlying this plasticity may identify a possible therapeutic for sympathetic hyperreflexia that would
enormously benefit SCI individuals. SCI-induced reduction of receptor cation-chloride cotransporter type 2
(KCC2) in neuronal membranes disrupts chloride homeostasis to decrease synaptic inhibition and has been
implicated in heightened spinal motor reflexes after SCI. Whether KCC2 contributes to sympathetic hyperreflexia
after SCI is not known. We theorize that SCI results in loss of KCC2 in the membrane of spinal neurons
associated with sympathetic function to contribute to sympathetic hyperreflexia. We also postulate that the loss
of KCC2 in the neuronal membrane results from activation of NF-B, a transcription factor that is downstream of
multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be increased following SCI. This proposal will focus on the
hypothesis that hyperexcitability of spinal, sympathetically-associated neurons after SCI is due to downregulation
of KCC2 expression via increased NF-B activation. The primary goals of this proposal are to: 1) investigate
KCC2 in the development of sympathetic hyperreflexia following SCI and if enhancing KCC2 function mitigates
sympathetic hyperreflexia (Aim 1); 2) determine if SCI-induced KCC2 downregulation occurs via NF-B (Aim 2)."

Chronic conditions pose a disproportionate burden on low-wage workers, exacerbating the adversity and
health inequities of this population. Chronic pain-related conditions contribute to disability and work limitations.
Work accommodations, which enable individuals with disabilities to perform job duties, have the potential to
mitigate these limitations and disabilities. However, a significant percentage of workers in the United States,
particularly low-wage workers who face additional barriers, do not receive work accommodations. Lack of
accommodations denies potential benefits to both employees and employers. Despite the prevalence of
chronic pain-related conditions among low-wage workers, little research has explored the utility of work
accommodations for advancing health equity in this population. This study aims to address this gap using
explanatory sequential mixed-methods research. The first phase includes quantitatively examining the use of
work accommodations by frequency and type and also assessing the extent to which employer-level factors
moderate workers receiving work accommodations. The second phase will be to qualitatively explore the
experiences of low-wage workers with chronic pain-related conditions and their process of receiving work
accommodations. The third and final phase is to integrate the quantitative and qualitative data, using the
qualitative results to inform interpretation of the quantitative findings. By shedding light on work
accommodations for low-wage workers with chronic pain-related conditions, this study will inform future
policies and promote workplace health and equity. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of the
experiences and challenges faced by this vulnerable population and guide interventions to improve workplace
well-being. This project is critical for developing the applicant’s skills in designing, conducting, and analyzing
mixed-method study designs as well as quantitative data, and qualitative data. This study will further her goal
of being an independent researcher with the focus of reducing workplace inequities and identifying impactful
strategies to positively affect health and quality of life by addressing the conditions in which people work."
10982629,"Longitudinal Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging to Discover Adolescent Alcohol Use Effect
PROJECT ABSTRACT
Alcohol abuse is the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States. A signature injury of Alcohol
Use Disorder (AUD) is in the white-matter (WM) microstructure and its constituents, which enable connectivity
of proximal and distal brain structures and functional integration. Despite the progress in understanding
alcohol’s effects in adults, still unclear is the causal direction between abnormal WM maturation and initiation
of heavy yet non-dependent drinking during adolescence. To gain insight into regional development of
connectivity, the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), a
prospective longitudinal study of 831 youth to track normal and alcohol-related deviant neurodevelopmental
trajectories, acquired diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data annually. Unraveling alcohol effects from the complex
dynamic course of adolescent neurodevelopment requires highly sensitive analysis approaches. In this project,
I propose a new type of longitudinal DTI analysis, in which a unified trajectory model is used both for explicitly
capturing biologically-plausible variation in DTI measurements across visits within each subject and for
estimating a group-level developmental trajectory. Such an approach will result in longitudinally consistent DTI
measurements enabling accurate characterization of microstructural development in normal adolescents.
Based on this approach, I will test the hypothesis that precursors of drinking onset and the disruption effects
induced by initiation of alcohol use are related to different brain regions. The analysis will identify the
precursors by comparing developmental trajectories prior to drinking onset between the no-to-low and heavy
drinking cohorts and will identify the disruption by comparing trajectories after drinking onset. The alcohol-
induced disruption to WM maturation will be further stratified with respect to age, highlighting the heightened
vulnerability in younger adolescents. Lastly, the proposed longitudinal analysis also facilitates further tracking
of microstructural remodeling following abstinence to identify reversible or persistent alcohol-related injury.
Revealed imaging phenotypes linked to adolescent heavy drinking could point to potential causes and
precursors of AUD, which could in turn improve diagnosis and prevention in clinical settings. Moreover,
researchers will be able to use the proposed longitudinal approach as a general tool to answer their
neuroscientific questions in the context of seeking developmental change."

Dementia is a disorder of multiple cognitive domains severe enough to affect activities of daily living and often
occurs with more than one neuropathology, including the most common Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular
dementia, Lewy body disease (LBD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). To postpone the onset or prevent
dementia, identifying modifiable risk factors is pivotal. Exposure to metals shows toxicologic evidence of
disruption of multiple neuropathological pathways, as well as suggestive cross-sectional associations in human
studies. However, relatively little is known about the impact of metals exposure on incident dementia and
longitudinal trajectories of functioning of multiple domains in the human populations. Using neurological
examination and clinical diagnosis from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC) and repository
plasma samples from the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias
(NCRAD), this K01 award application will determine metal concentrations and investigate their associations
with dementia. The Principal Investigator, Xin Wang, Ph.D., M.P.H., commits to a career in environmental
epidemiology and dementia research. The proposed training will build upon his research foundation in
environmental epidemiology with four training goals to enhance his trajectory to become an independent
investigator: (1) Gaining knowledge in principles of neuroscience, neurobiology in aging, and dementia
pathology; (2) Receiving training in clinical evaluation of dementia; (3) Developing expertise in neurogenetics;
and (4) Professional development activities. Dr. Wang will be mentored by Dr. Kelly Bakulski, an expert in
genetic and environmental epidemiology and the Data Management and Statistical Core Lead of the Michigan
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC), and Dr. Henry Paulson, an expert in clinical neurology and
neuropathology and the MADRC Director. Dr. Wang will also collaborate with Drs. Roger Albin (MADRC
Research Education Core Lead), Bruno Giordani (MADRC Associate Director), and Bhramar Mukherjee (Chair
of Biostatistics), and leverage resources available in the MADRC and NACC network. Aim 1 will examine the
associations of metals with dementia at the baseline (prevalence) and during the follow-up (incidence). Aim 2
will assess the associations of metals with baseline levels and longitudinal trajectories of cognition, functioning,
and neuropsychiatric domains. Aim 3 will evaluate effect modification of the associations of metals with
dementia and related clinical outcomes by APOE-ε4 genotype. The expected outcome is a comprehensive
evaluation of effects of metals exposure on dementia and related outcomes, and potential effect modifications
by APOE-ε4. Metals are modifiable and widespread exposures, therefore, findings from this proposal may play
an important role in dementia prevention and intervention. The outstanding training opportunities will greatly
enhance the skills and capabilities of the candidate and position him for a successful independent career to
develop his own research program to explore the intersection of environmental epidemiology and dementia."
10978267,"Minimally invasive liquid biopsies have revolutionized our understanding of cancer biology and emerged as
biomarkers for disease monitoring and drug development, but have been limited to a few commercial entities or
academic laboratories with the requisite technological capacity. The Circulating Biomarker Core (CBC) at the
University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) was established in 2017 to leverage innovative
technologies and clinical research infrastructure, to expand access to these biospecimens and assays for UW
faculty and NCI Cancer Centers across the country. Custom UW-developed liquid biopsy technology arises from
a decade-long collaboration between bioengineering and biomarker researchers at UW and offers unparalleled
sensitivity for rare target analytes. Dr. Jennifer Schehr, who played an integral role in developing and refining
custom liquid biopsy technologies since joining the lab of the founding director, Dr. Joshua Lang, in 2015, was
successfully recruited as facility manager for the CBC during its inception and continues to spearhead its
trajectory. The CBC supports NCI-funded research programs both directly through services provided to specific
NCI grants or trials, as well as indirectly as a shared resource facility pursuing the aims of the NCI cancer center
support grant (CCSG) to advance scientific partnerships, precision medicine research and education. Dr. Schehr
delivers high levels of scientific innovation and achievement in biology and biomarker discovery by providing
expert scientific oversight, investment in developing increasingly more powerful computational tools for rapid
data handling, and particular attention to thorough and continuous education and engagement of undergraduate
and entry-level staff. The CBC has now supported 64 different projects involving 34 different protein and nucleic
acid biomarkers, 9 NCI grants and 29 clinical trials from NCI cooperative groups, pharmaceutical companies and
Universities. Dr. Schehr leads the development of new methods for new cancer types, new liquid biopsy
biomarkers, and new clinical applications, as well as the setup, data management and biomarker utility
evaluation for ongoing clinical trials. Dr. Schehr is also actively engaged in developing process controls and
demonstrating analytical validity of custom technologies in pursuit of obtaining regulatory approval for
implementation into routine clinical use. With the recent successful execution of a UH2 analytical validation for
an mRNA panel in prostate cancer circulating tumor cells, the CBC has now gained approval for a UH3
regulatory-approved clinical trial, which will result in the first clinically actionable liquid biopsy developed by the
CBC under Dr. Schehr. Future directions include the development of automated workflows for circulating tumor
DNA (ctDNA) extraction and library preparation from >5,000 plasma samples over the next 5 years for a custom
ctDNA assay that evaluates 821 targeted mutations and high-sensitivity fragmentomic patterning to differentiate
tumor origin. Leveraging innovative problem-solving, computational tools for high efficiency, and an extensive
collaborative network, Dr. Schehr will develop and implement novel liquid biopsy biomarkers into clinical use."
10978813,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A frequent mode of therapy resistance is through the restoration of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair,
which can occur via secondary reversion mutations, or loss of DNA end resection proteins. While reversion
events are commonly detected, mutations in DNA end resection proteins are less frequently reported in patients,
and the molecular drivers of clinical resistance in many BRCA1 cancers remain unknown. In this proposal, we
have identified genes that when mutated do not impact resection, but restore PALB2 recruitment and induce
PARPi resistance. We now hypothesize that PARPi resistance can occur when mutations occur in genes that
function to block PALB2 recruitment to sites of DNA damage. However, mechanistic details remain to be defined.
The rationale for the proposed research is that PALB2 inhibitory proteins play a role in regulating mammalian
DNA repair, and loss of function events may account for a significant portion of PARPi resistant patient cancers
where RAD51 activity is restored, but mutations in DNA end resection genes or BRCA1 reversion mutations are
not detected. We will validate these resistance pathways in relevant mouse models of BRCA1 mutant cancer.
We will address the following Specific Aims: 1) define molecular features of PALB2 required for HR.; 2) elucidate
mechanisms of PALB2 inhibition; and 3) examine the role of PALB2 regulators in PARPi resistance. Collectively,
these studies have the potential to reveal new paradigms for DNA repair pathway choice and therapy response
and resistance."

Stimulant use disorders and overdose deaths resulting from methamphetamine use are on the rise.
Psychedelics, such as psilocybin, show therapeutic potential and efficacy against anxiety, depression,
alcoholism, and nicotine dependence, after administration of a single dose, but serotonergic psychedelics
exhibit polypharmacology and are not selective for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, which is necessary for
psychoactive effects. In this proposal we aim to investigate the role of 5-HT2A receptor signaling in
methamphetamine (METH) self-administration, neuroplasticity in vitro and in vivo, and on METH-induced
amotivation. These innovative studies utilize several novel and recently identified 5-HT2A selective tool
compounds with a range of G protein and β-arrestin recruitment efficacies designed to address the signaling
mechanisms involved in each of the following aims. In aim 1, we will determine the role of 5-HT2 receptors and
signaling pathways that lead to the suppression of reinforcing effects in a METH self-administration model. In
aim 2, we will examine the role of neuroplasticity in the attenuation of METH effects induced by psychedelics
and 5-HT2A selective agonists. In aim 3, we will determine the contribution of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors
toward attenuation of METH-induced amotivation using progressive ratio breakpoint task (PRBT) and
probabilistic reversal learning task (PRLT). Together, these studies will identify serotonin receptor signaling
profiles as a clear mechanism for psychedelic-induced efficacy for stimulant use disorders, with the potential to
identify neuroplastic and non-psychedelic signaling mechanisms for more effective treatments for drugs of
misuse.

10987499,"One of the most common craniofacial birth defects is craniosynostosis (CS), where connective tissue of
the sutures that normally separate skull bones is prematurely replaced by bone. While most CS cases
are of unknown origin, about 20% can be attributed to single gene mutations. Among these,
heterozygous inactivating mutations in ERF cause CS of variable severity, affecting multiple sutures
and sometimes manifesting later in childhood. Erf is an ETS2-related transcription factor (TF), but
unlike most family members is a transcriptional repressor. It is thought to compete with activating ETS2
factors for binding to the consensus site GGAA and prevent induction of target genes. Despite
widespread expression of ERF and the critical role that ETS2 signaling plays in normal development,
haploinsufficiency for ERF leads to a very limited set of defects. Our proposal is aimed at discovering
the underlying mechanisms leading to CS in a setting of reduced Erf. We have created a zebrafish erf
mutant which displays severe multi–sutural CS, demonstrating deep conservation of the role of Erf in
normal skull development. We previously identified three enhancers from the human genome which
direct expression to skeletal precursor cells in transgenic zebrafish, two associated with RUNX2 and
one with BMPER, that bind ERF in a yeast 1–hybrid assay. Both genes are independently implicated in
CS risk, suggesting that their increased expression in ERF mutants contributes to the pathogenesis of
CS. We propose to test specific hypotheses about the pathogenesis of CS caused by Erf reduction. In
Aim 1, we will use live imaging to follow the progression of CS in erf mutant fish. We will determine the
growth rate of the skull bones before and after suture formation, the timing of suture fusion, and how
variable the process is among mutants. These data will allow us to distinguish among models of CS
pathogenesis and focus our epigenomic profiling at the appropriate stages. In Aim 2 we will assess
genome–wide changes in accessible chromatin and gene transcription in erf mutants during
craniofacial development. We hypothesize that CS in erf mutants results from increased expression of
a small number of critical genes. By correlating open chromatin regions containing Erf binding sites with
upregulated genes in the erf mutants, we aim to identify critical genes that are direct targets of Erf
regulation. Finally, in Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that loss of Erf results in increased expression, of
RUNX2 and BMPER and of additional candidate genes implicated in Aim 2, by determining the activity
of identified enhancers in erf mutants. We will characterize the timing and tissue specificity of enhancer
activities and quantify changes in expression in erf mutants. Successful completion of our Aims will
provide detailed insight into the genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying craniosynostosis in the
setting of reduced Erf and the conserved role of Erf in normal craniofacial development."

This award will support Azmeer Sharipol, M.S., long-term goal of developing the expertise and skills needed to
become an independent investigator exploring the role of polypharmacy and microenvironmental dysregulation
in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using an applied microphysiological systems (MPS) approach. The standard
daunorubicin and cytarabine (DNR) chemotherapy for AML result in a 5-year survival rate of less than 30%.
70% of patients >60 years old succumb to the disease after 1-year of diagnosis. Polypharmacy, which is the
use of ³5 drugs to treat comorbidities, is common in vulnerable patients. However, it remains unclear whether
polypharmacy has an impact on AML chemotherapy. AML studies mostly focused on finding the intrinsic
mutations within the hematopoietic stem cell lineage that give rise to dysfunctional AML cells. However, the
role of the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) is often overlooked. Studies using in vivo models showed
that AML cells can dysregulate the BMME through cell-cell interaction and chemokine signaling. Azmeer’s
sponsor, Dr Benjamin Frisch, showed that AML cells inhibit osteoblastic cell function via C-C motif chemokine
ligand 3 (CCL3) in a clinically relevant murine AML model. However, it is challenging to prove the AML-BMME
signaling in human cases due to the lack of reliable in vitro model of the human BMME. Azmeer Sharipol will
address these gaps in research through an innovative research plan that leverages his background in applied
MPS. For the F99 phase, Azmeer will develop an in vitro human BMME-chip model using Emulate Chip-S1™
microfluidics systems and fibrin-hydrogel encapsulation containing osteoblastic, endothelial, and stromal cells
compartments that are important regulator of stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Using the BMME-chip,
he will elucidate the role of CCL3 in the dysregulation of the human BMME and investigate the targeting of
CCL3 receptors, CCR1 and CCR5, using small molecule inhibitors to rescue BMME dysregulation in AML-
BMME-chip. For the K00 phase, Azmeer will explore the effects of polypharmacy from common comorbidity
drugs including metformin and captopril in addition to standard chemotherapies on the BMME function using
the AML-BMME-chip, and in vivo models of AML. Azmeer Sharipol has worked closely with his sponsors to
develop a training plan that emphasized on building new knowledge and methodological skills to prepare him a
smooth transition into an independent research career path. The training plan includes improving knowledge in
cancer biology, cancer cell signaling, clinical pharmacology, and bioinformatics analysis. Azmeer and his
mentors also developed a plan for identifying a postdoctoral mentor. Together, the proposed research and
training plan provide optimal opportunities and structure for Azmeer to develop new skills and progress toward
cancer researcher."

 This proposal aims to translate our engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) into an effective
cancer therapy. Major barriers to effective chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy in solid
cancers include limited CAR-T cell tumor infiltration, loss of their function in the tumor microenvironment
(TME), and severe life-threatening toxicities. Designer EVs from cytotoxic immune cells have the
potential to overcome these crucial issues and become effective cell-free immunotherapy for solid
cancers. In response to PAR-22-071, we will optimize our designer EVs derived from engineered Nature
Killer (NK) cell line NK92 to treat melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. Death Receptor 5 (DR5) is highly
expressed in cancer cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs). MDSCs and CAFs are the major components of the immunosuppressive TME. We fortuitously
discovered that DR5-agonistic single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) were highly effective in killing
DR5+ tumor cells when expressed on non-cytotoxic lymphoblastic lymphoma Sup-T1 cells. We
developed a new lentiviral vector to deliver more DR5-scFvs to the surface of EVs and infected NK92
cells with the vectors. EVs from the engineered cells (DR5-scFv EVs) were more effective in killing DR5+
melanoma than DR5 antibodies and DR5-CAR-T cells. Systemic delivery of DR5-scFv EVs significantly
inhibited DR5+ tumor growth in vivo in multiple cancer models. A unique feature of DR5-scFv EVs is that
they significantly inhibited MDSCs and CAFs in vitro and in vivo and increased CD8+ T cell functions in
patient-derived organotypic cultures. Loading siRNA to mutant NRAS into DR5-scFv EVs further
enhanced their tumor-killing effect on melanoma with mutant NRAS. We will further develop DR5-scFv
EVs for clinical translation. In Aim 1, we will optimize cytotoxicity and immune stimulatory functions of
DR5-scFv EVs using different approaches and test these designer EVs in state-of-the-art models, such
as patient-derived organotypic melanoma cultures and genetically annotated melanoma patient-derived
xenografts (MPDXs). Aim 2, we will test the designer EVs in mouse clinical trials using genetically
annotated MPDXs in humanized mice. In Aim 3, we will optimize bioprocessing and standardize workflow
for the engineered EVs production to increase DR5-scFv-EVs yields and develop Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) for upstream production, downstream process, and quality controls. This proposal
will prepare our designer EVs for GMP production and to be explored as an alternative therapy for CAR-
T cells. We expect that our designer EVs will be qualified for NCI translational programs to continue a
path toward the clinic upon completing the proposal."

The prevalence of autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) is at an all-time high, with 17% of
children diagnosed with a developmental disability and 1 in 44 diagnosed with autism. Many of these disorders
have few or no established biomarkers, few or no medical treatments, and can only be diagnosed behaviorally,
emphasizing the need for research into causes and treatments. Furthermore, the vast majority of cases of
autism arise from multiple genetic and environmental causes, with less than 10% of cases having a single
identifiable cause. There is a critical knowledge gap regarding the way genetic and environmental risk factors
interact to contribute to risk for autism and other NDDs, and a critical need for animal models that incorporate
more than one type of risk factor.
Exposure to pyrethroid pesticides during pregnancy is an environmental risk factor for autism and NDDs.
Pyrethroids are among the most common pesticides in the US and are present in 70-80% of blood samples
from the general public. Nonetheless, multiple epidemiology studies have linked pyrethroid exposure during
pregnancy with autism and developmental delay in the child, and the presence of pyrethroid metabolites in the
blood predicts ADHD diagnosis.
The Shank3 gene is a prominent autism-associated gene, both because of evidence linking human Shank3
dysfunction to autism and 22q13 deletion syndrome. Shank3 mutations in mouse and rat lines lead to deficits
in social interaction, social communication, repetitive behaviors, and circadian rhythms, and preliminary data
shows that the Shank3 heterozygous (+/-) prairie vole has similar deficits in social interaction.
We propose to study the interaction of these two autism risk factors using the prairie vole, a wild rodent
species bred in the laboratory which has a unique set of complex species-specific behaviors similar to humans,
including monogamous bonding, biparental care, and consoling behavior. We will pair prairie vole mothers with
a Shank3 heterozygous father, and then expose the mother to low doses of the pyrethroid pesticide
deltamethrin during pregnancy and lactation. We will then study both wild-type and Shank3 offspring to assess
deficits in autism-relevant behaviors in the social, communication, cognition, repetitive behavior, and locomotor
domains. We will simultaneously assess biological changes in the brain, focusing on the MAPK/mTOR
signaling pathways, which are modulated by Shank3 and are altered in developmental pyrethroid exposure.
Successful completion of these Aims will inform about the interaction between two autism risk factors, Shank3
haploinsufficiency and developmental pyrethroid exposure. This will provide the starting point for a line of
research focusing on combined autism risk from multiple risk factors within a single animal model using
complex social behaviors as primary outcomes."

Motor function is often compromised by neurological injury, such as stroke and even healthy aging. Decline in
motor skills reduces the quality of life and independence in aging adults. In animal studies, applying brief vagus
nerve stimulation (VNS) during motor training dramatically improved motor recovery and learning (180-260%),
including strength and motor skills in stroke, spinal cord injury, and nondisabled rodents, young and old. Because
VNS upregulates central neurotransmitters linked with motor learning (e.g., norepinephrine, acetylcholine), which
decrease with age, this intervention is a hopeful candidate to help improve motor function in aging humans. This
project will explore the crucial unresolved issues in translating the animal-based VNS intervention to human
applications. One is the need to apply stimulation only after a successful trial to induce positive efficacy (post-
success VNS), according to systematic studies in animal research. The second issue is the invasive procedure
of implanting a VNS electrode and device in the neck and chest of humans, which would not be readily
acceptable for study or rehabilitation purposes. The efficacy of adopting a noninvasive alternative,
transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) via surface electrodes on the tragus of the outer ear, will need to be explored. To
explore these critical issues, we have published a paper confirming that applying tVNS during training alters
motor adaptation in young adults and have developed a closed-loop, automated, post-success tVNS system in
which an individual’s motor performance is assessed in real time, and tVNS is automatically applied after a
successful trial based on predetermined criteria. In this project, our primary aim is to examine the effect of post-
success tVNS during motor training on motor learning in healthy older adults. We will also explore whether the
amount of expected motor learning facilitation is associated with acute neuromodulation responsiveness to tVNS
at rest. We will randomly assign healthy older adults to the tVNS or control group. Participants will undergo motor
skill training sessions with post-success tVNS or sham stimulation, respectively. We will compare the time course
of improvements and transfer of motor skills between the groups. We will also investigate the correlation between
the improvements and a biomarker of acute neuromodulation response to tVNS (i.e., pupil size). This study will
furnish vital information on the efficacy of post-success tVNS in enhancing motor learning for healthy older adults,
and it has the potential applicability to other tasks, including whole-body control and strength, making it clinically
significant. Future clinical studies can determine if this intervention is beneficial in treating individuals with
movement disorders that suffer from spasticity (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury), dyskinesia (Parkinson’s Disease),
tremor (e.g., Essential Tremor), and discoordination (e.g., Spinocerebellar ataxia)."
10988777,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A high proportion of older adults are currently or soon will be at risk for the well-known decline in walking and
balance abilities that occur with aging. Preserving those abilities has become a major public health priority.
Balance training can enhance functional abilities or attenuate functional decline; however, age-related motor
deficits may impair practice-based motor learning and behavioral performance. Due to the crucial roles of the
spinal cord in balance and walking performance, it is important to consider that age-related neural impairment of
the spinal cord is a likely contributing factor. Specifically, the spinal cord in older adults has fewer neurons, is
less excitable, and conducts signals more slowly. Despite ample evidence of impaired spinal cord neuronal
structure and function with aging, the potential benefit of an intervention targeting spinal control of balance and
walking control has been largely unexplored. This dearth of research may be due in part to the lack of a clinically
feasible intervention. However, the recent emergence of transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS)
as a non-invasive intervention creates new opportunities for understanding spinal cord contributions to balance
and walking performance. The proposed study will be among the first multi-session trial to investigate the effects
of tsDCS as an adjunct therapy to dynamic balance training in older adults. We propose to include 30 participants
65 years of age or older with balance/walking deficits, who will receive active or sham tsDCS while performing a
dynamic balance training intervention. Balance and walking performance assessments will be conducted after
each of the five intervention sessions to examine the intervention's effects over time. Spinal excitability will be
assessed immediately before and after tsDCS at the first and last intervention sessions. Behavioral assessments
will only be carried out at baseline and 1 day post-intervention to investigate the pre vs. post intervention effect,
with a 10-day period considered for the retention effect. During behavioral assessments, prefrontal cortical
activity will be measured to provide insights into the demand for increased executive control. The first aim of the
study will be to acquire preliminary effect size and response variance data to assess whether active adjuvant
tsDCS therapy combined with dynamic balance training enhances practice-related gains in balance and walking
performance and retention over time. The second aim of the study will be to establish evidence of increased
spinal excitability following tsDCS, positively correlating with gains in balance and walking functions. The
overarching hypotheses of the proposed study are that the positive effects of tsDCS on practice-related
enhancements and retention in balance and walking function will be related to increased spinal excitability. The
long term deliverable of this line of research will be a clinically feasible multi-modal intervention to assist in
preserving motor function and independence in older adults. The knowledge and experience gained from this
study will enable us to conduct larger studies to better understand the effects of aging on the spinal cord and to
test rehabilitation interventions to promote healthy aging among older adults."

 Alcohol use is a prevalent problem among bi+ (bisexual, pansexual, queer) college students. Bi+ col-
lege students report disproportionately high rates of drinking and heavy episodic drinking (HED; i.e., consum-
ing 5+ drinks among people assigned male at birth, consuming 4+ drinks among people assigned female at
birth in 2 hours) relative to monosexual college students. Rates of trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) symptoms are also often highest among bi+ individuals. Bi+ people endure unique sexual mi-
nority stressors, including binegative discrimination from gay/lesbian and heterosexual individuals (enacted
stigma) and internalized binegativity (internalized stigma). Individuals with trauma histories may be vulnerable
to heightened stress responses to minority stressors and experiencing enacted stigma can provoke and exac-
erbate PTSD symptoms. Prior research supports the relationship between PTSD symptoms and alcohol use
and between sexual minority stress and alcohol use; however, there is limited understanding into whether
these factors synergistically increase the risk for alcohol use among bi+ young adults. Minority stress theory
(MST) suggests that health inequity among sexual minority individuals can be partially attributed to general life
stressors and sexual identity-related stressors, including enacted stigma and internalized stigma. The self-
medication model suggests that individuals with PTSD symptoms are more likely to drink alcohol to manage
distress. An integrated MST and self-medication model would suggest that the risk of alcohol use may be high-
est among those who experience co-occurring PTSD symptoms and minority stress. Additionally, risk for drink-
ing following enacted stigma may be especially high among bi+ individuals with elevated internalized stigma.
The overall objective of the proposed study is to elucidate the proximal associations between enacted stigma,
PTSD symptoms, and alcohol use among trauma-exposed bi+ college students. The study will identify the in-
teracting effects between daily enacted stigma and daily PTSD symptoms as well as between trait internalized
stigma and daily enacted stigma utilizing an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design. No prior re-
search has examined the relationship between bi+ college students’ minority stress, PTSD symptoms, and al-
cohol use and whether these risk factors interact to predict increased drinking. Guided by MST and the self-
medication model, the proposed study will advance the understanding and prevention of alcohol misuse. The
specific aims of this proposed study are to: (1) evaluate whether PTSD symptoms and enacted stigma tempo-
rally relate to alcohol use (any, HED, and number of drinks) and (2) evaluate whether PTSD symptoms and
trait internalized stigma moderate the temporal association between enacted stigma and drinking. The pro-
posed study will examine these factors in 60 bi+ college students with trauma histories utilizing an innovative
EMA design. The proposed study is significant because it will identify specific risk factors to address in the pre-
vention and intervention of alcohol use among bi+ college students."

Host defense and immunity are initiated by pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) binding to pathogen- or danger-
associated molecular patterns. Activation of immune cells in response to microbes or damaged tissue results
in the induction of antimicrobial processes, the production of inflammatory mediators, and activation of
adaptive immunity. Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), is a scavenger receptor that
is predominantly expressed on the surface of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia. TREM2
binds to a diverse array of host and pathogen anionic molecules, including phospholipids, DNA, and
lipoproteins, and contributes to sensing tissue damage. Given the myriad endogenous and microbial ligands
that become accessible during tissue damage and infection, TREM2 activity in vivo is complex. Signaling
through TREM2 in association with its adaptor protein DAP12 activates the tyrosine kinase Syk and can result
in beneficial or detrimental outcomes for the host, depending on the context. Despite its broad expression on
myeloid cells and its genetic association with neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases, the function of
TREM2 in host defense and immunity during infection in vivo remains incompletely understood.
Using a CRISPR knock-out strategy, we recently discovered a role for TREM2-DAP12-Syk signaling in human
monocyte activation during infection with Toxoplasma gondii. We also found that TREM2 knock-out (KO) mice
are acutely susceptible to T. gondii, with increased mortality and elevated parasite burden compared to control
wild-type (C57BL/6) mice. These preliminary data support the hypothesis that TREM2 plays a key role in
immunity against T. gondii. The objective of this proposal is to determine how TREM2 functions in human
innate immunity and in protection against T. gondii in vivo using human immune cells and a mouse model.
The first aim will examine the outcome of TREM2 activation in human immune responses by examining the
signal transduction pathways that are activated and the production of cytokines and chemokines during
infection or phagocytosis using control or TREM2 KO human monocytic cells and human induced pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia. The second aim will define the role of TREM2 in myeloid cell immunity in
vivo by comparing antimicrobial host defense and protective immune responses during infection of myeloid-
specific and microglia-specific TREM2 KO mice. The proposal involves the use of innovative single-cell
proteomic technology and human iPSC-derived microglia. This research is significant because it has the
potential to reveal a new receptor involved in innate immunity to T. gondii. In addition, an enhanced
understanding of how TREM2 functions in the periphery and in microglia in the brain during infection may
inform the development of strategies to increase its protective activities during disease."

 Ribosome biogenesis occurs in the nucleolus, and disruptions to nucleolar proteins cause
ribosomopathies such as Treacher Collins syndrome and contribute to a range of proliferative and degenerative
diseases. Nucleoli contain three nested sub-compartments that are phase-separated from each other and differ
in composition, density, and function. The inner-most fibrillar centers (FCs) are surrounded by dense fibrillar
components (DFCs). Transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) occurs at the interface between the FC and DFC,
and maturation of rRNA occurs in the DFC. In the outermost phase, the granular component (GC), rRNA
incorporates ribosomal proteins to create ribosomal subunits. The equilibrium nature of phase separation implies
that the relevant factors concentrate themselves into specific phases without energy input. This coupled with the
nested architecture of the nucleolus, sets up thermodynamically controlled fluxes across the distinct layers.
Recent studies have described a molecular handoff model for setting up the inward flux of ribosomal proteins
into the granular component. However, ribosomal assembly requires an outward flux of rRNA, and how this is
set up, whether this is under thermodynamic control, and the key molecular players that set up such a flux remain
entirely unknown. My goal is to uncover the mechanisms that set up the flux of rRNA into and through the
granular component of the nucleolus.
 In my preliminary work I determined the critical factors involved in setting up rRNA flux and began
reconstituting this process in vitro. I used bioinformatics analysis and in vivo localization studies to identify the
protein nucleolin as the key protein that sets up rRNA flux. My reconstitutions show that nucleolin mediates rRNA
flux out of the DFC and into the GC. Recent studies in the literature and my preliminary studies show that
nucleolin helps set up the flux of rRNA through the GC. My preliminary data leads to the hypothesis that
ribosome biogenesis relies on the thermodynamic flux of rRNA into and through the granular component
(GC) and that this is primarily mediated by nucleolin. This hypothesis will drive my specific aims: 1 -
Determine which biophysical features of nucleolin (NCL) and rRNA complexes are required to set up
rRNA fluxes from the dense fibrillar component (DFC) into the granular component (GC) and 2 - measure
a series of linked phase equilibria of nucleolin, nucleophosmin, rRNA, and rProtein to determine if they
contribute to rRNA flux through the granular component"

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of mature plasma cells accounting for 1.8% of new cancer
cases annually, and 10% of hematological malignancies. Immune-based therapeutic interventions targeting B-
cell maturation antigen (BCMA) lead to high response rates in patients with heavily pretreated disease and, two
Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell products targeting BCMA are FDA-approved. Despite remarkable
clinical responses, most patients have disease remissions induced by BCMA CAR-T cell therapy that do not last
more than 18 months. Given that, novel treatment approaches are urgently needed and, they rely on the
identification of biologically and therapeutically relevant targets.
To address this gap of knowledge, we developed a novel integrated pipeline based on mass spectrometry
analysis of seven MM cell lines and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from 900+ patients. Starting from 4,000+
candidates, we identified the most highly expressed cell surface proteins. We annotated candidate protein
expression in many healthy tissues and validated the expression of promising targets in 31 patient samples with
relapsed or refractory MM, as well as in normal hematopoietic stem cells and T cells. Six candidates (SEMA4A,
ILT3, CCR1, LRRC8D, FCRL3, IL12RB1) and BCMA presented the most favorable profile in malignant and
healthy cells (Di Meo F. et al., Cell Reports Medicine 2023). We hypothesize that our target discovery strategy
uncovered novel MM-associated antigens that meet strict criteria of relevant immunotherapeutic targets: a) they
are highly and frequently expressed in patients; b) their expression in normal tissues is minimal and c) targeting
these antigens impacts critical features of MM biology.
 In Aim 1, we will define the distribution of antigen expression in MM patients, especially high-risk patients
in relapsed disease state. We will precisely measure antigen density (number of molecules per cell) in primary
bone marrow malignant plasma cells by flow-cytometry. We will use a unique cohort of 50 MM patients who
relapsed or progressed after BCMA CAR T-cell therapy, comparing expression patterns to BCMA. Further, we
will use normal tissue arrays from autopsies and surgical specimens and single-cell RNA seq data from BM
samples of healthy donors to predict on-target off-tumor toxicity. These studies will define the relevance of lead
targets such as SEMA4A to MM patients and identify the role of targeting novel antigens to rescue patients who
relapse with a BCMA-resistant or -negative disease. The results will serve to optimize the design of CAR
constructs based on quantitative profiling of antigen density in malignant and normal cells.
 In Aim 2, we will screen several CARs recognizing SEMA4A that we constructed upon an antibody
discovery campaign generating novel purified monoclonal antibodies. We will further systematically compare
multiple dual-targeting platforms targeting SEMA4A, BCMA and ILT3 in vitro and in vivo. These studies will serve
to identify a lead strategy that may prevent antigen escape and maximize the elimination of MM cells."

Peri-implantitis is one of the most common and challenging implant-related oral infections that affect millions of
patients every year. This project aims to develop a multi-functional [antibacterial and bioactive (that can
osseointegrate efficiently)] patient-specific dental implant that can effectively prevent peri-implantitis.
Specifically, we will develop highly tunable silver-doped amorphous magnesium phosphate (AgAMP) bioceramic
particles and incorporate them in a high-performance biopolymer matrix known as Polyetheretherketone (PEEK)
to engineer AgAMP-PEEK multi-functional composite, referred to as Ultra-PEEK. Notably, Ultra-PEEK will be
developed as uniform diameter filaments that can be used in a Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)-based 3D
printer as a feedstock material to develop high-resolution implants. Feasibility studies show that the 3D-printed
Ultra-PEEK implants exhibit approving mechanical properties, and the Ultra-PEEK implant composition
demonstrates comparable osseointegration properties to clinical standard Titanium implants. Notably, Ultra-
PEEK implants also show promising in vitro antibacterial efficacy. However, refining the implant composition and
3D printing parameters is necessary to yield implants with optimum mechanical, antibacterial, and
osseointegration properties (i.e., with high clinical value). Hence, in the first specific aim, we aim to determine
the processing-structure-property relationships of 3D-printed Ultra-PEEK implants. To accomplish the latter aim,
we will analyze the effect of AgAMP content on Ultra-PEEK’s mechanical properties. We will develop 3D-printed
Ultra-PEEK implants with varying AgAMP content using high-temperature FFF and validate their fatigue strength
per FDA requirements. In the second specific aim, we will determine the infection resistance and
osseointegration properties of Ultra-PEEK implants. The bacterial inhibition capabilities will be initially
determined in vitro using biofilm models against peri-implantitis-associated oral pathogens. Biocompatibility will
be determined using standard in vitro assays. Finally, a well-proven polymicrobial peri-implantitis rodent (rat)
model will be used to determine Ultra-PEEKs’ infection resistance and osseointegration capabilities. Finally, in
the third specific aim, a highly translational peri-implantitis porcine animal model will be used to determine
the implants' infection resistance and osseointegration capabilities by analyzing clinical parameters such
as bleeding on probing, pocket depth, gingival recession, and clinical attachment level compared to
titanium controls. After accomplishing this project, we envision establishing the first-of-its-kind, unique,
antibacterial, and bioactive 3D printed implant that will hinder peri-implantitis incidences for patients needing
tooth implants and relieve patients from the baleful aftermaths of implant-related infections."
10995190,"Pancreatic cancer (PanCan) is notorious for its resistance to therapy including immunotherapy,
which is largely contributed by a suppressive tumor microenvironment. Targeting molecular
pathways integral to PanCan resistance to current therapy remains an unmet need. Notch
signaling regulates PanCan growth, metastasis, and the tumor microenvironment. While other
studies have shown that Notch signaling in macrophage and myeloid derived suppressor cells
plays an immune-suppressive role in breast cancer and lung cancer, for example, our proposal
will study previously unrecognized role of JAG1 in the regulation of the metabolic fitness of
conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) that underlies the poor anti-tumor responses to
immunotherapy. The overarching objective of this application is to define if targeting Jagged1
(JAG1), a Notch ligand, whose expression correlates with a worse prognosis and inversely
correlates with BATF3, essential for type I cDC (cDC1) development, could reverse the
immunotherapy resistance in tumors with poor tumor-infiltrating cDC1 and T cells. cDC1 cells
present tumor antigens to tumor-killing T cells and thus play a critical role in supporting T cell anti-
tumor immunity in immunotherapy. However, dendritic cells are present in low numbers and often
display functional suppression in pancreatic cancer patients. Our recent work revealed that JAG1
functions as an inhibitory Notch ligand for cDC1 development as well as cDC metabolic fitness.
We also found that ablating JAG1 induced marked tumor regression and prolonged tumor-bearing
mice long-term survival by increasing and reviving tumor-infiltrating DCs and Notch-activated
tumor-killing T cells. We will test our central hypothesis that JAG1 promotes PanCan therapy
resistance by suppressing cDC1 metabolic fitness and CD8 T cell anti-tumor response through
three interrelated aims. In aim 1, we will test if anti-JAG1 blocking antibody could sensitize
resistant tumors to immunotherapy. In aim 2, we will investigate the mechanism by which JAG1
impairs cDC metabolic fitness essential for anti-tumor activation. Aim 3 will focus on the
mechanism of anti-tumor T cell reinvigoration mediated by JAG1 ablation/blockade. We will use
a combination of the autochthonous KPC mouse model, immunophenotypically defined KPC
orthotopic tumors, human PanCan organoids/myeloid cell coculture, and human PanCan
specimens. We will employ cutting-edge mass cytometry to investigate the interplay between
tumor cells and the surrounding immune cells and the tumor stroma. We will integrate the
immunophenotyping and the spatial transcriptomics of rare immune cell populations with clinical
and histopathological information to correlate molecular findings with patient outcomes. This work
is innovative as we illuminate a novel function of JAG1 in the maintenance of PanCan therapy
resistance and explore its potential as a novel immunomodulatory treatment for this deadly
disease."

The overall project objective is to leverage patients enrolled in the BEAR-MOON Trial to evaluate a
neuromuscular mechanism that may explain differences in functional outcomes between the novel
bridge-enhanced anterior cruciate ligament restoration (BEAR) and the standard of care, anterior
cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery (ACLR). Whereas ACLR requires removal of the injured
ligament and the bony insertion sites to implant a tendon graft, BEAR uses a scaffold to promote healing of
the injured ACL. Therefore, the ACL neural structures and bony insertions remain intact with BEAR, while
they are severed and removed during ACLR. Early clinical studies have shown that muscle strength is
restored following BEAR, but not after ACLR at 2-year follow-up. We have data to show that joint motion
abnormalities similarly persist over a decade after ACLR, which are thought to be a risk factor for
posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Therefore, we postulate that differences in muscle recovery and joint motion
are due to the preservation of neuromuscular function with BEAR. The BEAR-MOON Trial (the parent
study) is a multicenter, randomized control trial comparing 2-year outcomes of BEAR to those of ACLR.
While the parent study will establish whether differences exist between procedures, it was not designed to
determine the mechanism behind those differences. Therefore, the overarching ancillary study hypothesis is
that BEAR preserves the neuromuscular activation patterns about the knee that, in turn, promote normal
hop landing joint motion compared to ACLR at 2 years post-surgery. The ancillary study addresses three
aims: 1) to apply our innovative machine learning approach to classify neuromuscular activity patterns as
belonging to ACLR, BEAR or healthy control subjects (Controls); 2) to compare knee position between
ACLR, BEAR, and Controls at ground contact when landing from a 1-leg hop; and 3) to determine the
relationship between neuromuscular activity patterns and joint motion abnormalities. Twenty-six subjects
enrolled in the BEAR-MOON Trial at Rhode Island Hospital will be recruited into the ancillary study at their
2-year parent study follow-up visit. An age- and sex-matched control group will be recruited from the
community. All 39 subjects will perform a 1-leg hop-for-distance activity while surface electromyography is
recorded to assess neuromuscular function (Aim 1), and biplane videoradiography will be performed to
evaluate precise tibiofemoral motion (Aim 2). Regression analysis will be used to relate neuromuscular
activation patterns with tibiofemoral position (Aim 3). The ancillary study dovetails well with the parent study,
which is now in its final year of recruitment. If the hypotheses of the ancillary study are supported, the
results will demonstrate that ACL mechanoreceptor continuity is the mechanism governing neuromuscular
function, and that its loss with ACLR is a driver of joint motion dysfunction and possible downstream joint
arthrosis that can be explored in future longitudinal studies."
10996525,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Social interaction strongly influences both momentary mood and general mental health. Indeed, social isolation
during the recent pandemic caused record-high levels of mood symptoms in many individuals around the world.
This relationship between social interaction and mood has been documented not only in mood disorders, but
also in the descriptions of many other psychiatric illnesses. So, better elucidating the influence of social
interaction on mood may have powerful implications for treating those burdened by socio-affective deficits.
Recent work in computational psychiatry has defined mood as a progressive impact of reward prediction errors
(RPEs), which reflect the differences between predicted and perceived rewards. These efforts have been
expanded to account for learning specifically within the social domain. In society, we must often learn social
norms, or agreed-upon rules of behavior among social groups. These norms change over time, as driven by
norm prediction errors (nPEs), which act as learning signals that help us to predict norms more accurately in the
future. nPEs, like RPEs, influence short-term mood. Yet, it is not well known how nPEs relate to long-term mood
symptoms. We are also limited in our understanding of how nPEs are encoded in the brain. Prior work has
predominately relied on neuroimaging techniques, which can identify high-level cortical circuits involved in norm
prediction but cannot as reliably assay the potential involvement of subcortical micro-structures. Alternatively,
human single-unit recording may be used to directly examine the roles of micro-structures in norm prediction at
the resolution of single neurons. Single-unit studies have identified neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), a
subcortical nucleus that is hard to reach with fMRI, that are involved in RPE encoding. Given similar
computational relationships with mood and associated activity on neuroimaging, RPEs and nPEs may also share
common encoding by SN neurons. To date, this hypothesis has never been tested. Considering these critical
knowledge gaps, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying
the influence of social interaction on mood by leveraging computational modeling (Aim 1) and human single-unit
recording (Aim 2). The central hypothesis is that nPEs influence both short- and long-term changes in mood; we
further predict that nPEs are neurally encoded by single-units in the human SN, which is supported by pilot data
collected from twelve patients so far. These findings will expand our neurophysiological understanding of the
relationship between mood and social learning in health and disease in hopes of informing future
psychotherapeutic interventions for disorders that adversely affect social and affective functioning. This research
will take place at the Centers for Computational Psychiatry and Advanced Circuit Therapeutics at the Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Completion of this proposal will afford the applicant rigorous training in
computational modeling and human single-unit recording, thereby accelerating her progress towards becoming
a future physician-scientist and leader of a research program in invasive computational psychiatry."
10996527,"Project Summary/Abstract
Binge-spectrum eating disorders (BSEDs; e.g., bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder) are serious mental
health disorders that are prevalent among adolescents. The defining feature and primary treatment target for
BSEDs is recurrent episodes of binge eating (BE; i.e., overeating while experiencing a loss of control over
one’s eating). Despite a need to intervene on BE during adolescence to reduce long-lasting deleterious
psychosocial and physical health outcomes, outcomes from existing treatments are suboptimal, possibly
because the maintenance factors of BE during adolescence are poorly understood and available treatments
may not effectively target the most potent mechanisms. Thus, research is urgently needed to identify novel
mechanisms of adolescent BE to advance the development of interventions. Adolescence is a period
characterized by significant social and emotional change. Consequently, adolescents display heightened
sensitivity to social evaluation, and the quality of adolescent social relationships is robustly linked to mental
health outcomes. Adolescence is also a critical period for socioemotional learning and the development of
abilities to regulate negative affect, which is theorized to maintain BE. Thus, one theory of BE that may be
particularly relevant during adolescence is the interpersonal model, which proposes that interpersonal
stressors predict BE, and this relationship is mediated by increases in negative affect. Harnessing digital
assessment tools and advanced statistical methods has the potential to examine the interpersonal model and
identify intervention targets by: 1) Testing the interpersonal model on a momentary level in adolescents’ natural
environments to uncover temporal relations between interpersonal stressors, affective states, and adolescent
BE and reveal opportune moments for support; 2) Exploring heterogeneity within the interpersonal model
based on key individual characteristics (i.e., dietary restraint and emotion regulation) to inform the development
of personalized interventions; and 3) Exploring how specific types of interpersonal stressors (e.g., peer
rejection, parental conflict) and affective states (e.g., anger, embarrassment) may differentially contribute to BE
within the interpersonal model, which could serve to refine theories of adolescent BE and inform tailored
intervention approaches. The proposed study will employ ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to
examine temporal relations between interpersonal stressors, affective states, and BE among 30 adolescent
(ages 14-18) girls with BSEDs. We will test the prospective effects of experiencing an interpersonal stressor on
BE and examine the mediating role of negative affect. We will also examine if the strength of the relationships
between interpersonal stressors, negative affect, and BE varies based on dietary restraint and emotion
regulation. Exploratory analyses will examine the relative temporal effects of specific types of interpersonal
stressors and specific affective states on BE. This study has the potential to significantly advance
understanding of mechanisms of adolescent BE and inform the development of novel, real-time interventions."
10997166,"The overarching goal of this Academic-Industrial Partnership is to develop an at-home, self-administered lung
cancer screening test based on the analysis of chromatin architecture in cells swabbed from the buccal (cheek)
mucosa, which can identify patients at risk for early-stage lung cancer who may benefit from definitive follow up
evaluation such as CT. Lung cancer mortality depends on stage at diagnosis. The combination of recently
developed immunotherapy, chemoradiation, and robotic surgery has led to the near curation of cancers detected
at early stages such as IA. However, most patients are still diagnosed at late stages. Current screening
guidelines recommend all patients with smoking history exceeding 20 pack-years to receive LDCT. Due to
underreporting, noncompliance, and the rapidly increasing rates of lung cancer in non-smoking subjects as well
as quit- and second-hand smokers, most lung cancer deaths now occur in patients who would not qualify for
LDCT. There is an urgent need for an easy-to-administer screening test capable of detecting early-stage lung
cancer. We propose a new approach that leverages lung field carcinogenesis and chromatin conformation
alterations as the biomarker source and type, respectively. An advantage of the approach is its practicality (i.e.,
analysis of swabbed buccal cells) and the sensitivity to early-stage cancer regardless of tumor size. We have
found that nanoscale alterations in chromatin domains play a critical role in fostering the transcriptional plasticity
of precancerous cells in field carcinogenesis and have developed a statistical optical spectroscopic nanosensing
technology, chromatin-sensitive partial wave spectroscopic (csPWS) microscopy, to measure chromatin domain
conformation with sensitivity down to the size of the 20nm chromatin chain. In the proposed project we will build
upon these results and finalize the development of csPWS. We will optimize chromatin conformation biomarkers
by combining the quantification of chromatin conformation using csPWS within domains defined by histone
marks and transcriptional activity imaged using spectroscopic single molecule localization microscopy with deep
learning methods to capture the complexity of the chromatin conformation-transcriptional plasticity association.
Chromatin scanning transmission electron tomography will be used to identify chromatin conformation features
as biomarker candidates. Finite-difference time-domain computational electrodynamics simulations will provide
the link between the chromatin features and csPWS measurements. Molecular theory simulations will be used
to confirm the etiological association between the chromatin domain conformation biomarkers and proneoplastic
transcriptional patterns. The prediction rule will be validated in an independent patient dataset. The endpoint will
be detection of stage I lung cancer across population, including LDCT-eligible/ineligible smokers and
nonsmokers. We will ensure that the prediction rule is robust with regards to tumor histology, demographics, and
risk factors. Upon the completion of this project, the lung cancer screening test based on the optical analysis of
buccal chromatin conformation will be ready for a definitive clinical trial."

Language delays are common in autism and ADHD. Prior studies on early language development in infants
developing autism or ADHD have examined each condition separately and are largely incompatible with a
transdiagnostic framework, limiting our understanding of whether similar or different mechanisms contribute to
language delays in these populations. One proposed mechanism of early language learning is absent reference,
which is conceptualized as a three-way connection between words, imperceptible physical entities, and mental
representations. To better understand the developmental course of absent reference in typically and atypically
developing samples, longitudinal studies beginning early in life are needed. Additionally, while social contingency
in the infant-toddler period appears to be important for the development of language, it is unknown whether
absent reference mediates this association. This F31 proposal will leverage the primary mentor’s longitudinal
sample of n=163 infants at elevated and typical familial likelihood for autism and ADHD, with data collected at
6/9, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age. At 36 months, clinical best estimate outcomes (e.g., Autism, ADHD
Concerns) are determined. Using a novel eye-tracking task which I developed, I will first examine trajectories of
absent reference over the first two years of life, including comparisons of absent reference trajectories between
typically and atypically developing infants (Aim 1). Then, I will use micro-analytic behavioral coding to capture
the degree of temporal coordination (contingency) during infant-caregiver interactions and a standardized
measure of receptive and expressive language, probing absent reference as a potential mediator of the
association between early social contingency and later language abilities, and exploring the possibility of
moderated mediation by outcome group (Aim 2). Strategic training goals and activities have been crafted as part
of the F31 proposal to fill important knowledge, skill, and experience gaps in my training through robust
mentorship from experts in longitudinal studies using transdiagnostic frameworks (Miller), cognitive and language
development (Xu, Thurman), dyadic interactions (Schwichtenberg), and advanced statistical procedures (Iosif).
Overall, the proposed training and research plans will facilitate progress towards my long-term goal of securing
a tenure-track faculty position that bridges developmental and clinical science and will lead to advancements in
the fields of language development, neurodevelopmental conditions, and developmental psychopathology.
Results from the proposed study will have implications for efforts aimed at detecting language difficulties earlier
and for the development of targeted interventions to support language development."

Chromatin-modifying enzymes that are associated with enhancer function are frequently mutated in human
craniofacial disorders. Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a craniofacial development disorder characterized by
mutations in KMT2D, a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase. Neural crest cells (NCCs) are the stem
cells from which anterior facial bone and cartilage originate. Our preliminary studies show that mouse NCC
deletion of KMT2D results in a lack of cranial base chondrocyte hypertrophic differentiation. As KS patients
present with skeletal defects that may result from abnormal chondrocyte differentiation, understanding the
mechanism of KMT2D function in this differentiation process is crucial to a better understanding of both
craniofacial and skeletal development disorders. This proposal will assess KMT2D’s molecular mechanism in
Aim 1 by interrogation of KMT2C/D-deficient NCCs in culture for changes in KMT2D genome binding,
chromatin accessibility, differential gene expression, and localization of histone-methylation at enhancer
regions utilizing genomic methodologies during chondrocyte differentiation. As previous publications have
indicated methylase-independent roles for KMT2D, this proposal will utilize KMT2D rescue constructs to
identify critical domains and non-enzymatic roles of KMT2D in cranial chondrocyte differentiation using
genomics and genetic approaches. Aim 2 will explore the cellular mechanism of chondrocyte-specific loss of
KMT2C/D on cranial base formation using histology, immunofluorescence, and other imaging approaches.
Long bone growth plates will also be examined in chondrocyte-specific KMT2D mutant mice for morphological
and molecular changes of chondrogenic differentiation markers to assay broader KMT2D-dependent
chondrocyte mechanisms. Collectively, this proposal will ascertain the novel functional roles that KMT2C and
KMT2D play in regulating chondrocyte differentiation and the results of this study will implicate epigenetic
modifiers in the progression and therapeutics of skeletal disease."

Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can lead to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) long after resolution
of acute infection, implicating lasting alterations to tissue immunity, but the underlying pathogenic mechanisms
remain poorly understood. The long-term goal of this project is to define the mechanisms by which congenital
infection impinges on cochlear immune development to drive SNHL. The overall objectives in this application
are (1) to determine the contribution of the fetal host immune cells, specifically resident tissue macrophages
(RTMs) to normal cochlear development and (2) to determine how CMV shapes tissue immunity during perinatal
development to drive cochlear dysfunction. The central hypothesis is that RTMs are crucial to normal cochlear
development and that the response of fetal-derived RTMs to CMV infection is a critical mediator of cochlear
damage that drives SNHL. Our preliminary data indicate that fetal macrophages of distinct ontogenetic origin
seed the cochlea in a specific spatiotemporal pattern. Temporal blockade of CSF1R, a regulator of fetal
macrophage development, causes cochlear impairment and SNHL. Together, these findings suggest that fetal-
derived RTMs are critical regulators of normal cochlear development and tissue homeostasis, but the precise
mechanisms have not been delineated. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
Define the contribution of fetal RTMs to normal cochlear development; 2) Determine the effect of acute CMV
infection on RTM development; and 3) Determine the immune drivers of progressive SNHL following acute CMV
infection. In the first aim, we will employ fate-mapping and deletion of specific ontogenetic macrophage subsets
to define the spatiotemporal seeding and function of distinct waves of RTMs in normal cochlear development. In
Aim 2, we will investigate the effect of acute CMV infection in the perinatal period on seeding, transcriptional,
and functional regulation of RTM development in the cochlea. In Aim 3, we will examine how replacement of
fetal RTMs with adult BM-derived RTMs reshapes cochlear immunity and cochlear function, both under
homeostasis and in response to acute infection. We will combine fate-mapping, transcriptomic analysis and
genetic deletion models to define how replacement of fetal RTMs with BM-derived RTMs contributes to cochlear
inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and hearing function. The research proposed in this application is
innovative because it examines the origins of CMV-associated SNHL and cochlear dysfunction from the
perspective of immune ontogeny and because it integrates state-of-the-art fate-mapping and deletion models
with single-cell transcriptomics, advanced microscopy, and specialized hearing tests to perform highly detailed
mechanistic studies over the course of CMV pathogenesis and associated SNHL. The proposed research is
significant because it will contribute fundamental knowledge about the developing auditory system and provide
strong scientific justification to examine RTMs as a potential novel therapeutic target for SNHL treatment."

Airway abnormalities in children, such as subglottic stenosis (SGS) and Robin sequence (PRS), may result in
breathing difficulties, risk of recurrent infections, hypoxia, respiratory insufficiency, life-threatening events, and
long-term morbidity. In children with airway abnormalities, a multidisciplinary approach to care involves
selection from a variety of medical and surgical interventions. Therapy is typically directed by the clinician's
experience and preference, rather than based on normalized, quantitative physiologic and anatomic metrics.
Static computed tomography (CT), dynamic CT, and bronchoscopy have been considered for quantitative
diagnosis and assessment. However, quantitative measures of what constitutes normal airway geometry and
how normal airway geometry changes with respect to age, weight, and sex are lacking. Such normative
measures can be used to score the degree of airway abnormality, define thresholds for abnormality, and better
understand surgical interventions' impact. In previous work, we developed the Pediatric Airway Atlas to provide
spatially localized normative measures for upper airway cross-sectional areas in children derived from a
population of static 3D CT images.
The goal of the proposed study is to build upon our database of 3D CT images and associated clinical
measures to develop the computational methodology for a Pediatric Airway Shape Atlas (PASA), which will
model the upper airway as a 3D shape instead of restricting airway characterization to cross-sectional area
only. The PASA will allow for a comprehensive characterization of 3D geometry. Specifically, the core of the
PASA will be a new, innovative neural additive shape model that is designed to allow for interpretable results,
captures the effects of relevant covariates (such as age, sex, and weight), and allows within the same
framework to predict likely airway changes over time for individuals thereby providing a means to quantify the
effect of surgical interventions on 3D airway geometry.
Our approach will provide improved, non-invasive quantification of airway abnormalities. Automated data
analysis will allow for rapid refinement of atlas-based analyses and will greatly simplify use by other research
and clinical groups. The resulting software will be open-source. Furthermore, the new methodologies
developed will be broadly applicable to multiple, common causes of airway obstruction in children and adults."
10977593,"Mechanistic intermediates in copper oxygenases and oxidases:
Copper oxygenases and oxidases have a wide range of functions including melanin and siderophore
biosynthesis, neurotransmitter regulation, iron metabolism, and proton pumping for ATP synthesis.
Understanding their reaction mechanisms is both of fundamental importance and has significant downstream
applications in health, biotechnology, and catalysis. There has been much mechanistic speculation based on
structures, model complexes, and calculations. However, the key to determine the enzyme mechanisms and
thus utilize and control their reactions is by trapping catalytic intermediates and defining their structures and
reactivities. Our research combines enzyme kinetics to trap intermediates, a range of spectroscopies to define
these intermediates, and electronic structure calculations correlated to experiments to elucidate reaction
mechanisms. Our focus is on the three classes of copper oxygenases and oxidases. The antiferromagnetically
“coupled” binuclear Cu enzymes include catechol oxidases (CaOx), tyrosinases (Ty), and o-aminophenol
oxidases (AOx) that all utilize the same µ-η2-η2 CuII2O22− intermediate to perform their functions. In Progress,
trapping the ternary intermediate of OxyTy with phenol substrate bound has defined the Ty monooxygenase
mechanism, and our studies are now directed toward determining the mechanisms of the CatOx’s and the AOx’s
and how these enzymes are tuned for their selectivity. The “non-coupled” binuclear Cu enzymes include
dopamine β-monooxygenase that converts dopamine to norepinephrine, the insect homolog tyramine β-
monooxygenase, and peptidylglycine ⍺-hydroxylating monooxygenase. In this class, the two Cu’s are separated
by 11Å resulting in the lack of magnetic coupling. A major point to address is whether co-substrate binding
induces a conformational change to bring the Cu’s together for coupled binuclear O2 activation or if the 11Å
structure is active. If the latter, important issues will be explored including whether O2 activation by a single Cu
(a CuII–O2− intermediate) is able to perform H-atom abstraction and the timing of electron transfer from the 11Å
Cu required to complete the reaction and avoid reactive oxygen species (ROS). The third class is the multicopper
(MCOs) and heme–copper oxidases (HCOs) that reduce O2 to H2O, using different active site structures for
different functions. The MCOs use a trinuclear Cu cluster for efficient oxidation of substrates, while the HCOs
use their binuclear site to pump protons across a membrane for ATP synthesis. Studies on the MCOs are far
along in defining their mechanism of O2 reduction, their role in Fe metabolism with control of ROS, and coupling
to electrodes for fuel cell applications. For the HCOs, intermediates are available that would elucidate the O–O
bond cleavage mechanism and the active site structural changes that enable proton pumping. However, the
dominant spectral features of the hemes have precluded defining the role of the Cu and its Tyr-crosslinked His
ligand in these reaction steps. New spectroscopic methods being developed will enable definition of the complete
Heme/Cu/Tyr active site and its role in the O–O cleavage and proton pumping mechanisms."

Spinal cord Injury (SCI) leads to sensorimotor paralysis for which there is currently no cure. Our previous work
determined that optogenetic spinal stimulation, a relatively new method for stimulating the spinal cord, has robust
neuromodulating effects that significantly increases axonal growth, neuro-vasculature and importantly, functional
recovery in rats with sub-chronic cervical spinal injuries. However, recovery was less complete in rats with more
severe injuries. With the overarching goal of identifying effective therapeutics for spinal injuries of varying
magnitudes, the proposed study will further develop and optimize optogenetic spinal stimulation for the severely
hemi-contused spinal cord. More specifically, in Aim 1 we will identify if increasing the number of weekly
stimulation periods will promote significant recovery in rats with a severe cervical hemicontusion. We will increase
stimulation sessions from 1x/week to 2,3 and 4x/week and investigate the effects on forelimb functional recovery
of four behavioral tasks. In Aim 2, we will investigate the combinatorial effects of optogenetic spinal stimulation
and Intracellular Sigma Peptide (ISP) on functional recovery in rats after severe cervical hemicontusion. ISP
alleviates the inhibitory effects of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans on axonal growth and new circuitry formation
after SCI. We hypothesize that combining this peptide with optogenetic stimulation will increase the critical
formation of new circuitry bridging the lesion site, helping to reconnect upstream neurons with downstream
targets that will translate into improved functional recovery. This will be further explored in Aim 3, where we will
identify the changes in circuitry that occur in response to optogenetic spinal stimulation alone or in combination
with ISP delivery. This will be assessed by looking at spinally-evoked forelimb muscle activity in combination
with the activity-sensitive viral vector CaMPARI2 to identify participating neurons, as well as additional tissue
analysis using immunohistochemistry and RNAScope. Overall, the proposed study will further develop and
optimize a new and powerful method for therapeutically stimulating the spinal cord and promoting significant
functional recovery within the sub-chronic, severe SCI community. The findings from circuitry analysis will also
provide important insights into future strategies for further improving functional recovery after SCI."

 Adolescent concussion is a major public health concern, affecting nearly 2 million children and adolescents in the
U.S. each year. These injuries result from biomechanical forces acting on the brain. Primarily invovled in emotion
processing and regulation, midline brain regions −including the fronto-limbic system and hypothalamus/pituitary− are
particularly vulnerable to these forces. The reporting of transient psychological symptoms is common following a
concussion; h
owever,
adolescent g persistent psychological problems (e.g., anxiety)
irls are at a greater risk for
after injury. It is important to note that adolescence is a period marked by hormone-dependent mechanisms of brain
plasticity that open a window of heightened sensitivity to the influences of endogenous and exogenous factors on the
brain. Thus, it is conceivable that a concussion during this period may increase risk for psychiatric morbidity, especially
in girls who, having a more rapid transition through puberty, may have a limited time to heal. If puberty has an effect
on concussion, concussion is also likely to affect puberty. Intriguing evidence of post-concussion hypopituitarism are
emerging; yet the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Filling this knowledge gap is important because a better
understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of adolescent concussion can aid in early identification of risk
and provides new targets for the development of future interventions. The objective of this application is to investigate
the pathophysiologic mechanisms of persistent psychological symptoms in adolescent concussion and to further un-
derstand the role of pubertal hormones across sexes and pubertal stages, when neurodevelopmental changes with
potential downstream consequences for psychiatric vulnerability may occur. By prospectively characterizing 6-month
trajectories of psychological symptoms in 10- to 18-year-olds with and without concussion, this proposal aims to ex-
amine if a) hormonal changes and/or b) concussion-related lesions in midline brain regions can help explain the
persistence of these symptoms across different pubertal stages and sexes and to further determine c) the contribution
of pubertal maturity and sex on these relationships. To this end, we will use a combination of hormonal profiles,
capturing changes in pubertal hormones for up to 3 months after injury, state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods, al-
lowing to detect indirect indices of brain injury in subacute and chronic phases of concussion, and statistical methods
designed to model different effects of complex developmental processes during adolescence. This is innovative be-
cause no study has used such a highly integrative approach to examine the influence of hormones and MRI abnor-
malities in adolescent concussion and how these relate to pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the persistence
of psychological symptoms in 10- to 18-year-olds. This contribution is anticipated to be significant because findings
from the proposed project will not only aid in identifying subacute and chronic mechanisms of concussion in 10- to
18-year-olds but will also help advance neurodevelopmental theories of psychiatric vulnerability. These findings may
also offer objective targets for future research on personalized intervention strategies designed to modulate mecha-
nisms of brain plasticity in a sensitive period, and therefore more likely to be effective."

Latina adolescents report especially low activity,2,3 being less than half as likely to meet physical activity
guidelines as Latino boys. Compared to non-Latino White girls, Latina adolescents have 50% higher rates of
overweight/obesity and 60% higher rates of metabolic syndrome4,5 and these disparities continue into
adulthood.6,7 Effective physical activity counseling delivered through Federally Qualified Health Centers could
have broad impacts on Latina teens, yet it is estimated that only 50% of pediatric visits include any discussion
of physical activity. Due to constraints on provider time and expertise, referrals to exterior programs may be
necessary. Through iterative research, including pilot trials (R03NR014329), interviews, design workshops,
and beta testing with a youth advisory board, we have developed a theory-based multi-technology MVPA
intervention for Latina teens, Chicas Fuertes, which is currently being tested in a fully powered trial with a
healthy community sample (R01NR017876). Intervention content is delivered via web, Fitbits, individually
tailored text messages, and Instagram; preliminary data show high engagement and excellent retention
(>90%). Given the use of scalable mobile technologies to deliver the intervention, an adapted version of the
intervention that focuses on guideline adherence has good potential for a referral system; effectiveness or
implementation of such interventions in clinical settings has never been tested. Therefore, we will conduct a
hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial of FQHC referrals to an augmented, EMR-integrated, remotely
delivered version of the intervention (Chicas Fuertes 2). In the proposed study, providers at Family Health
Centers of San Diego, the largest FQHC in San Diego County, will refer N=200 adolescent Latinas (age 13-17)
to receive a wearable tracker integrated into EMR; they will be randomized 1:1 to receive no other intervention
(comparison arm) or to receive the Chicas Fuertes 2 intervention. We will build a bidirectional data sharing
system in EMR which allows for referral to the program and documentation of MVPA back to EMR as a vital
sign. Adherence to guidelines will be measured at six and 12 months via accelerometers. We will also evaluate
change over time in physical and mental health measures (e.g., BMI, blood pressure, depression), and
examine daily guideline adherence throughout the course of the intervention using data from wearables
(Fitbits). Finally, we will conduct a thorough mixed methods analysis of facilitators, barriers, and outcomes of
implementation guided by the PRISM framework to inform future scale-up across FQHC’s and future
sustainability, including staff time needed to run the intervention and potential to integrate tasks into existing
staff roles. The proposed study will build a foundation for broad implementation, using existing clinical systems
and widespread technologies to shift health behaviors across the life course and promote health equity."

Despite the progress in the treatment of advanced melanoma brought by the approval and use of immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), most patients are resistant to therapy initially or respond but then relapse. A critical
pathway that controls responses to ICIs is regulated by interferon-gamma (IFNγ). While IFNγ signaling increases
expression of immunostimulatory genes (IStGs) required for response to ICIs, it also induces the expression of
immunosuppressive genes (ISpGs) that support tumor immune escape and promote resistance to ICIs. This
dual and opposing role of IFNγ signaling supports the need to identify an approach to inhibit expression of ISpGs,
without limiting the expression of IStGs to improve the response rates to ICI-based therapies. We have identified
a new transcriptional regulatory function for the Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) downstream of the IFNγ receptor,
independent of its autophagy-related function. We have shown that, in malignant melanoma cells, inhibition of
ULK1 represses IFNγ-induced transcription of ISpGs, without affecting the expression of IStGs, both in vitro and
in vivo. Importantly, we have found that ULK1 interacts with IRF1 in the nuclear compartment of melanoma cells
and show that inhibition of ULK1 kinase activity reduces the binding of IRF1 to ISpG’s promoter region, but not
to IStGs. Remarkably, high levels of ULK1 correlate with poor survival and with an immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME) in melanoma patients. Moreover, in preliminary studies we show that drug-targeted
inhibition of ULK1 with anti-PD-1 (αPD-1) therapy induces significant increases in the percentages of IFNγ and
perforin producing CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells and reduction in the frequency of Tregs compared to αPD-
1 treatment alone in co-culture assays using B16 melanoma cells and pmel-1 splenocytes. The goal of this
project is to determine if blocking ULK1 will limit IFNγ-induced immunosuppressive effects and promote an
immunostimulatory TME, overcoming resistance to ICIs in melanoma. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by
which ULK1 mediates the immunosuppressive function of IFNγ in melanoma cells. It includes generation of
specific CRISPR knockout (KO) cells, and studies to determine the role of IFNγ-induced ULK1-mediated
phosphorylation of IRF1 in melanoma cells. Aim 2 will determine the direct role of ULK1 in immune cell function
against melanoma and in response to ICIs in vivo using conditional Ulk1 KO mice. Additionally, we will use
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to specifically target ULK1 in primary human CD8+ T cells and study its role in
regulation of signaling cascades, gene transcription, and CD8+ T cell activity against melanoma. Aim 3 will
determine the role of ULK1 in ICI-resistant melanoma models. We will determine the effects of genetic or
pharmacological inhibition of ULK1 in response to ICIs in vivo. Additionally, we will correlate the expression of
ULK1 and IRF1 proteins in melanoma patient tumor biopsies with expression of ISpGs and IStGs, immune cell
infiltration/activation and response to ICIs. Together, the proposed studies should definitively establish the role
of ULK1 as a therapeutic target to overcome resistance mechanisms to ICI therapy in metastatic melanoma."

10998917,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Natural killer (NK) cell engagers are a promising anticancer therapy that potently leverages the immune system
while providing an exceptional safety profile. Trispecific killer cell engagers (TriKEs) are NK cell engagers that
mediate NK cell killing of tumor cells through multispecific binding. TriKEs contain a tumor binding domain, an
IL-15 cytokine, and a CD16 engager. The IL-15 and CD16 engager stimulate robust NK cell activation and
tumor cell killing while the tumor binding domain targets the therapy to the tumor microenvironment. Expansion
of the TriKE platform to target new tumor-associated antigens requires integration of novel TriKE tumor binding
domains. This process is bottlenecked by difficulties preserving TriKE functionality and developability (i.e.
sufficient stability, aggregation, and recombinant yield for therapeutic use) upon the addition of a new tumor
binding domain. This project will transform the TriKE discovery process by interrogating the impact of
specific tumor binding domain properties on the resultant TriKE’s functionality and developability,
including use of innovative hyperstable miniproteins. Specifically, Aim 1 will investigate the impact of
tumor binder scaffold architecture by comparing the performance of several different scaffolds within TriKEs,
including antibody fragments and hminiproteins. Aim 2 will investigate the impact of preemptively optimizing
tumor binder stability and recombinant yield before insertion into TriKEs. This will be accomplished by
systematically varying tumor binder stability and recombinant yield and quantifying the impact on TriKE
functionality and developability. These investigations will involve the production and characterization of
experimental tumor binding domains and TriKEs targeting B7-H3, an established tumor-associated antigen.
The primary goal of this work is to inform the design of TriKE tumor targeting domains, thereby streamlining the
expansion of the platform to new therapeutic targets. Furthermore, this project will advance the development of
TriKEs as a therapeutic option for B7-H3 positive cancers."

Regulatory T (Treg) cells play central roles in the establishment of immune tolerance but are barriers to anti-tumor
immunity and immunotherapy. In response to immune- and microenvironment-derived signals, Treg cells undergo
activation and differentiation from quiescent central Treg (cTreg) cells into an activated Treg cell population called
effector Treg (eTreg) cells with heightened suppressive function. How Treg cells are fated for eTreg cell differentiation
and functional programming in different immune contexts and tissue microenvironments remains poorly defined.
Further, although the concept of Treg cell heterogeneity (beyond the cTreg versus eTreg cell paradigm) is evolving,
the molecular processes shaping such heterogeneity and the functional effects remain poorly understood.
Metabolic reprogramming is emerging as a regulator of Treg cell identity, differentiation, and function. Our lab has
established mTORC1-orchestrated nutrient signaling and metabolic rewiring, including mitochondrial metabolic
fitness, as important drivers of eTreg cell differentiation or maintenance. Although these effects are attributed to
reduced mTORC1 signaling, hyperactivation of mTORC1 in Treg cells drives impaired eTreg cell lineage stability
and survival, associated with a loss of immune tolerance while simultaneously improving anti-tumor responses.
Thus, metabolic processes act as a rheostat to control eTreg cell functional fitness in diverse contexts, and
uncovering upstream signals that regulate intracellular metabolic reprogramming in Treg cells may reveal novel
ways to boost their function in autoimmune or inflammatory diseases or limit their activity in the tumor
microenvironment (TME). In our preliminary studies, using genetic models of Treg cell-specific gene deletion in
vivo, we uncovered a role for metabolic signaling complexes in shaping the generation of distinct eTreg cell
functional states that establish tumor immunosuppression versus tissue tolerance. Specifically, we applied Treg-
specific genetic targeting approaches to disrupt multiple components of autophagy- and endosome-associated
pathways. Our preliminary data show that Treg cell-specific deletion of such genes led to markedly disrupted
immune homeostasis, causing mice to develop a fatal Scurfy-like inflammatory disorder in conjunction with
improved anti-tumor responses. Such effects were associated with altered eTreg cell accumulation and metabolic
fitness and mechanistically were partly attributed to autophagy but not to endosome activity. My central
hypothesis is that metabolism-associated signaling and processes downstream of autophagy initiation and
endosome maturation facilitate context-dependent Treg cell functional adaptation and heterogeneity. Further,
targeting such molecules may represent a novel means to tune Treg cell function in autoimmune or inflammatory
diseases and cancer. Through the completion of three complementary but independent Aims, I will establish the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of eTreg cell accumulation and function that are mediated by autophagy-
related molecules i) under steady state and ii) within the tumor microenvironment, as well as expand my studies
to iii) determine the role of endosome-associated molecules in the maintenance of Treg cell functional fitness."

The long-term goal of this study is to develop a highly effective non-toxic regimen by a combination of natural
products green tea (GT) and quercetin (Q) to enhance the therapeutic effect of docetaxel (Doc) in treatment of
metastatic and castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in African-American (AA) patients. The risk of
advanced prostate cancer including mCRPC in AA men is 2.5 fold greater vs. Caucasians, and the increased
risk can not be eliminated by corrections for factors that may affect the access to health care. This emphasizes
the importance of improving the clinical treatment of prostate cancer in order to reduce the disparity in prostate
cancer mortality. Doc is a standard treatment for mCRPC. However, severe dose limiting toxicities along with
chemoresistance limit the clinical success of Doc. The resistance to Doc is associated with upregulation of
anti-apoptotic signaling and overexpression of transport proteins including MRP. Previously we found that Q
can synergistically enhance the anti-cancer effect of GT in prostate tumor cells by increasing bioavailability of
non-methylated GT polyphenols, increasing pro-apoptotic signaling and decreasing MRP1 expression.
Therefore, GT and Q may be ideal candidates to be combined with Doc to sensitize tumor cells to Doc. Our in
vitro studies demonstrated that combining GT and Q with Doc synergistically enhanced the anti-proliferative
effect in CRPC cell lines. The combined effect of GT/Q/Doc was further confirmed in our animal studies,
where GT and Q enhanced the potency of Doc 2-fold in inhibition of PC-3 xenograft tumor growth, with no
increased toxicity. The objective of the proposed phase I/II trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of GT and
Q in combination with Doc for mCRPC in AA patients. Specific aim 1 will evaluate the safety and efficacy of GT
and Q in combination with Doc in AA patients with enzalutamide- or abiraterone- resistant mCRPC. Aim 1a will
determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of GT and Q with Doc/prednisone. A phase I-II trial with the
EffTox design will be carried out to test three dose levels with 8 cohort of patients (n=3 per cohort). The
selection of optimal doses for successive patient cohorts will be based on both efficacy and toxicity. Aim 1b
will assess the efficacy of GT and Q with Doc/prednisone compared to Doc/prednisone. An extended phase II
study will be conducted with the enrollment of additional patients on RP2D and a control group, with 30
patients for each group. Specific aim 2 will validate the effect of GT+Q in reversing the resistance to Doc in
prostate cancer mouse models. Two different mouse models will be utilized, including a xenograft model of
Doc-resistant PC-3 tumors and a prostate-specific PTEN knockout mouse model with a Doc-resistant tumor
phenotype. The proposed study will set the stage for phase III clinical trials of this highly promising and
urgently needed regimen to enhance the treatment of mCRPC and reduce disparities in PCa mortality in AA
patients. Given the non-toxic nature of both GT and Q this study could deliver near term benefit to patients."

Our abilities to engineer synthetic cell systems that can communicate with living cells remain
limited. The long-term goal is to engineer cell-like systems with increasingly complex biomimetic
functions that can serve as cell replacements or augment functions of natural cells. The
objective of this proposal is to develop a mechanosensitive synthetic cell that can respond to an
increase in shear stress, which is most prevalent in the cardiovascular system, and secrete
bioactive molecules to affect living cells. Cells in our bodies constantly sense and respond to
microenvironmental stimuli, including passive and active physical stimuli, such as extracellular
matrix rigidity, adhesive ligand density, tension, compression, and fluid shear flow. The rationale
underlying this proposal is that completion will result in a novel biomimetic cell-like system as a
novel shear stress-responsive ‘material’ that can interface with natural living cells. Most
engineered biomaterials respond to differences in the biochemical environment (e.g. differences
in redox, pH, and enzyme composition) between normal and diseased tissues. By comparison,
there has been relatively less effort in exploiting forces for stimulus-responsive behaviors. The
synthetic cell idea is inspired by natural platelets’ ability to bind and respond to elevated shear
stress and secrete granule contents when bound to a surface. The proposed work consists of
three specific aims: 1) Characterize the shear stress response of mechanosensing vesicles, 2)
Couple mechanosensing with exocytosis in synthetic cells, and 3) Test intercellular
communication of shear stress-activated synthetic cells with endothelial cells in vitro. We will
pursue these aims using an innovative approach of repurposing mechanosensitive channels for
shear stress sensing and using peptide-based membrane fusion. Our lab was the first group to
demonstrate mechanosensing synthetic cells and we have significant expertise in bottom-up
synthetic biology. The proposed research is significant because it will be the first synthetic cell
system developed to communicate with mammalian cells using calcium-triggered secretion. The
work will develop fundamental strategies for coupling mechanosensing to a biochemical
response in synthetic cells. This will open new avenues for other researchers interested in
developing more complex cell-like systems. The results will have an important positive impact
immediately because it will support the idea that mechanosensitive channels can sense lateral
membrane tension due to shear stress and long-term because they lay the groundwork of
engineering synthetic cells with other sensing abilities."

Obesity and subsequently type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasingly common in adolescents, but the
phenotype of youth-onset T2D (YO-T2D) differs from adults. The NIDDK TODAY study we
helped lead, demonstrated that youth with T2D had a high (≈50%) and rapid failure rate on oral
medications and faster need for insulin therapy vs. adults treated for a similar duration in the
ADOPT study. As further evidence, in our NIDDK RISE study, where treatment responses in
youth with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or newly diagnosed T2D were directly compared to
adults of similar BMI and initial glycemia, youth were twice as insulin resistant as adults and had
rapid deterioration of β-cell function and glycemic control compared to adults given the same
treatment with similar medication adherence. Finally in our HIP study, metformin did not improve
insulin sensitivity or secretion even when started early in puberty in normoglycemic youth with
obesity, arguing for innovative approaches. Of most concern, TODAY demonstrated an
incidence of microvascular diabetes complications ranging from 32-68% by a mean age of only
26.4±2.8 yrs, affecting individuals who should be at their peak of productivity; complications
more heavily affected those with minority race/ethnicity, raising concerns related to health
disparities. This unprecedented early morbidity and projected health care costs mandate a focus
on defining a) the ideal T2D diagnostic and/or screening criteria for youth b) pathophysiologic
distinctions between Y-T2D and adult-onset T2D c) how to prevent Y-T2D d) how to better treat
Y-T2D once present. Though some risk factors for developing Y-T2D (e.g. family history,
obesity, etc.) are well-established, only a small subset of these high-risk youth progress to T2D
as adolescents. Thus, other causal components need to be explored, such as adverse
childhood experiences, stress, poverty, racism, sleep/circadian rhythm, subtle differences within
sedentary behavior, and the exact impact(s) of pubertal hormones. The 15-site multicenter
DISCOVERY Study aims to enroll 3,600 diverse youth (240 from our site) at risk for developing
T2D from urban and rural locations who are early in puberty, and perform longitudinal
assessments every 6 mo paired with additional sample storage to be analyzed once a “critical
mass” of youth with new-onset T2D is accumulated. Our primary objective is to identify
physiologic drivers and other determinants of progression to T2D by charting the course of
glycemia, β-cell function, insulin sensitivity, psychosocial, behavioral, and social determinants of
health during this critical period of maturation and inform approaches for precise prediction of
which youth are at highest risk of developing T2D during this period. Local and central
stakeholders will play an active role in the study and provide feedback during follow-up.
Secondarily, during this 5-year funding period, DISCOVERY will create a biobank of samples
with associated phenotypic data to allow the DISCOVERY investigators to perform analyses to
identify the risk factors for progression to T2D."

Stem cell transplantation therapies are emerging as some of the most promising methods for treating an array
of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders where the primary cause of pathology is cell death. Among
the most exciting of these approaches is the transplantation of human Neural Precursor Cells (hNPCs) that are
derived from human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) to replace neuronal loss. For targeted stem cell
therapies to be successful, programmed hNPCs must undergo a complex and dynamic set of processes in vivo
after transplantation, including proliferation, migration, and integration into the existing circuit. Although it is
accepted that all of these processes are critical to the success of hNPC transplantation therapies very little is
known about their dynamics, either in patients or in animal models. The ability to track the changes that hNPCs
undergo once in the neocortex, in vivo over the lifetime of the animal, will provide key insights into the
mechanisms governing transplant integration, as well as the functional impact that transplants have on existing
circuits.
The goal of this proposal is thus to develop cutting edge methods for in vivo imaging and neurophysiology to
study the structural dynamics and functional impact of hNPC transplantation in adult cortical circuits in the
mouse. We are ideally suited to accomplish this goal as we have shown that hNPCs derived from hiPSCs
transplanted into the juvenile mouse integrate into mouse cortical and hippocampal circuits. Furthermore, we
have pioneered multiphoton in vivo imaging and neurophysiology methods in the mouse that will support the
innovations proposed for tracking the structural and functional dynamics of transplanted hNPCs. Using this
expertise, we will accomplish the goal of this project via the following 3 aims.
In aim 1, we will determine the structural maturation of human NPCs transplanted into the adult mouse using
lifetime in vivo 2-photon imaging. In aim 2, we will determine the molecular and cellular identity and
characterize the intrinsic biophysical properties of NPCs engrafted into the adult mouse. In aim 3, we will
characterize the functional properties of neurons differentiated from transplanted hNPCs in the visual cortex of
awake behaving mice."
10978859,"Our new preliminary data indicate that ErbB3 signaling is essential for the integration of early inflammatory
response with adaptive immunosuppression, thus preventing the activation of cardiac lymphocytes and
protecting the heart against secondary immune cell-mediated tissue damage. We found that ErbB3
upregulates the expression of PD-L1 on myeloid cells in response to their stimulation with inflammatory factors.
Myocardial tissue lymphocytes express high levels of PD-1 that inhibit the activation of T cells upon binding to
PD-L1 on myeloid cells. Reduced level of PD-L1 expression in mice with disrupted ErbB3 signaling is
associated with activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and myocardial dysfunction in a mouse model of LPS-
driven inflammation. We also found that ErbB3 promotes up-regulation of PD-L1 after ischemia-reperfusion
(I/R) cardiac injury. To better understand the role of ErbB3 in the regulation of the PD-L1/ PD-1 axis and
myocardial protection, we generated novel mouse models with ablation and overexpression of ErbB in myeloid
cells and subsets of myeloid cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and Ly6Clow monocytes. In specific
aim 1, we will determine the role of ErbB3 in the regulation of the myocardial PD-L1/PD-1 axis and
immunosuppression during the acute inflammatory response using loss-of-function and gain-of-function mouse

prevents degradation of PD-L1 in myeloid cells. In specific aim 3, we will determine the role of lymphocyte
activation and Ly6Clow monocytes in the promotion of fibrosis in remote myocardial areas in mice with disrupted
ErbB3 signaling in myeloid cells."
10999086,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Caspase-8 is the primary protein that drives the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and is frequently mutated,
contains polymorphisms, or downregulated in various cancers. Through the literature and many previous findings
in our lab, we have identified potential apoptotic and non-apoptotic roles of caspase-8 in modulating T cell killing
and inflammatory signaling. Further, my preliminary data identifies differences in T cell effector markers/function
as well as potential macrophage cytokine signaling. Taken together, these findings implicate Caspase-8 in
interferon responses, macrophage cytokine production, and T cell effector function, all of which have known
importance in anti-cancer immunity. However, despite the downregulation of Caspase-8 in various cancers
and its widespread inflammatory functions in apoptotic and non-apoptotic signaling pathways, its roles
in promoting or inhibiting anticancer immunity or affecting immunotherapies have not been explored.
Thus, the two proposed project aims seek to interrogate the role of Caspase-8 in tumor cells as well as the tumor
microenvironment, with a focus on its potential roles on anticancer immunity and CAR-T cell function.
 The goal of Aim 1 seeks to understand the roles of Caspase-8 in cancer cells which influence anti-cancer
immunity. Specifically, this aim will compare relevant murine cancer cells with or without Caspase-8 to identify
differences in (1) proliferation and inflammatory signaling, (2) resistance to CAR-T cell induced killing (3) in vivo
growth and immune cell infiltration.
 The goal of Aim 2 seeks to understand the roles of Caspase-8 in the tumor microenvironment (TME),
including immune cells and stromal cells, which influence anticancer immunity. Specifically, this aim will compare
how caspase-8 in the TME alters (1) macrophage polarization, in vivo tumor growth, and immune infiltration, and
(2) ability for CAR-T cells to induce death in relevant murine cancer cells.
 The training plan focuses on extending my previous experience in cancer biology and current experience
in the field of cell death into the field of immunology by exposing me to advanced techniques in the field of
immuno-oncology. From presenting at departmental journal clubs, lab meetings, and seminars, to institutional
and international conferences, I will improve my presentation skills. Through a K99 application and manuscript
preparation, I will continue to maintain my writing skills. Finally, through advanced coursework and shadowing, I
will increase my knowledge and experience in the fields of immunotherapies and clinical trials.
 The training environment at St. Jude boasts numerous cores which assist with mouse work and gene
editing, while the Immunology department itself boasts flow cytometry and Immunologic Imaging cores
specifically designated for the department. In addition to the many cores, St. Jude hosts numerous symposiums
and provides funding for postdoctoral fellows to receive additional training via courses and conferences."
10987986,"ABSTRACT: Radiation therapy is a necessary component of current treatment for many brain tumors.
Radiation therapy leverages a therapeutic ratio in which tumor cells suffer radiation damage and die, while
normal brain cells repair radiation damage and are less negatively affected. Improvements in the therapeutic
ratio are badly needed both to improve brain tumor cure probability and limit risk for radiation effects on the
normal brain such as radiation necrosis and neurocognitive dysfunction. Efforts to widen the therapeutic
window for radiation therapy of brain tumors have included chemical approaches to combine RT with drugs
intended to increase tumor cell radiosensitivity, or normal cell radioresistance, however, to date, few effective
therapies have emerged. Recently, advances in physics have produced “ultra-high” rates of radiation dose
delivery (termed “FLASH-RT”). Compelling reports point to normal tissue protection with FLASH-RT dose
delivery, however the molecular mechanism of FLASH-RT is largely unknown. Interestingly, ferroptosis cell
death mechanisms have been implicated. Our multidisciplinary collaborative team has leveraged
complementary expertise to develop resources and preliminary data to improve the brain tumor radiation
therapy therapeutic window through both chemical and physical means. We have created a unique
experimental platform with two novel components: 1) A highly tunable, very high dose-rate electron FLASH-
RT beam provided by the High Intensity Gamma-ray Source (HIGS) at the Triangle Universities Nuclear
Laboratory (TUNL) and 2) an Organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC) assay platform that allows interrogation of
both tumor and normal brain tissue cells in an elevated-throughput dry-culture system highly amenable to
experiments with both standard RT and our unique FLASH-RT beam. Encouragingly, preliminary data in our
OBSC system shows that ATM kinase inhibition seems to protect neurons from ferroptotic death. To achieve
our long-term goal to widen the therapeutic window, we propose two hypotheses: 1) ATM inhibition can widen
the radiation therapeutic window for brain tumors by sensitizing tumor cells and protecting neurons especially
under FLASH-RT conditions, and 2) Cancer cells depend on adaptations to maintain rapid growth in the brain,
and these adaptations can be exploited to enhance tumor cell killing. We will test these hypotheses with the
following aims: 1) Optimize HIGS-FLASH beam parameters (dose, dose-rate, targeting) for enhanced
metastatic brain tumor cell kill with maximal protection of normal brain under normal and ATM inhibition
conditions. 2) Test genetic targets for radiation sensitization in glioblastoma cells under standard and FLASH-
RT dose rates in the OSBC system. We expect that this project will elucidate cytotoxic mechanisms of both
standard and FLASH-RT and generate highly-translatable drugs and drug targets to widen the therapeutic
window for brain tumors. If successful, this project will expand to larger screening sets and additional brain
tumor types, with in vivo model validation."

Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) is known to develop from a combination of genetic, epigenetic and
environmental influences, yet most animal models are based only on genetic alteration. Here, we develop and
extend an existing, but understudied, model of mouse cleft lip and palate with a known epigenetic contribution,
A/WySn. By using novel methods to examine the relationships between DNA methylation, gene expression,
proliferation and morphology in a single embryo we can directly relate these parameters. This allows us to
study how genetically identical individuals enter differing developmental trajectories, including the presence or
absence of a structural birth defect. We present two aims which focus on the development of the model and
show how these aims can progress into aims for a future R01 application. These aims dissect the complex
genetics of this model so that future grants can model how epigenetic changes lead to signaling changes and
morphological changes which cause orofacial clefting. Aim 1 focuses on the understanding the molecular
mechanism leading to CL/P in the model, while Aim 2 focuses on cellular level changes leading to CL/P
development.
Aim 1 has two subaims which focus identifying the gene or genes responsible for the epigenetic modification of
the Wnt9bIAP from the Clf2 locus and understanding how it functions as a modifier of the cleft lip phenotype in
the A-strain mouse lines. In the future we can perturb methylation to understand its role as a driver of CL/P and
knock out a gene in the Clf2 domain to confirm their role as a modifier of Wnt9bIAP methylation.
Aim 2 builds imaging tools and pipelines to model how changes in a cell biological property, such as
proliferation and apoptosis, lead to a phenotypic change such as CL/P. In the future, we can use this method to
test hypotheses around how altered growth may lead to birth defects using computational models.
Together, these aims expand our knowledge of epigenome-phenotype maps by expanding our mechanistic
understanding of how variation flows through development to generate phenotypic variation."
10989366,"Antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae has been rising over the last decade, leading the WHO and the
US CDC to label the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant N. gonorrhoeae a serious public health threat.
Development of a vaccine against N. gonorrhoeae is considered a critical step in prevention strategies to slow
the spread of antibiotic-resistant N. gonorrhoeae. However, individuals infected with N. gonorrhoeae remain
susceptible to repeat N. gonorrhoeae infection because they fail to develop effective protective immune
responses. Our research has found that the PorB porin, the most abundant protein antigen in outer membrane
vesicles (OMVs), suppresses the capacity of antigen-presenting dendritic cells to stimulate T cell proliferation
when treated prior to addition of T cells. This immunosuppressive effect likely contributes to immune evasion by
the bacteria and the failure to develop protective immune responses. Recently, N. gonorrhoeae infections have
fallen in countries or regions that deployed mass vaccination campaigns with vaccines against N. meningitidis
serogroup B made from OMVs, suggesting that these vaccines may offer partial cross-species protection against
N. gonorrhoeae. However, these OMVs have very high levels of PorB (and a related porin, PorA). We
hypothesize that because of the documented immunosuppressive effects of PorB, it is likely that these porins
limit the immunogenicity of OMV-based vaccines. One possibility is that the immunosuppressive effects of PorB
are due to its channel activity. To test whether decreasing or ablating the channel activity reduces the
immunosuppression mediated by PorB, we propose in Specific Aim 1 to use a structural model of PorB to
introduce cysteine (Cys) mutations at locations within the pore that would have a high likelihood of decreasing
or ablating channel permeation following modification by Cys-directed chemical reagents and crosslinkers. We
will establish the effectiveness of these different reagents to inhibit permeation by assessing channel activity in
lipid bilayers and in multilamellar vesicles using established protocols. Porin mutants that are readily inactivated
by sulfhydryl-directed reagents will be examined for their capacity to inhibit dendritic cell-mediated T cell
proliferation. To test whether reducing the level of PorB in OMVs impacts immunogenicity of vaccination with
OMV, in Specific Aim 2 we will create a strain of N. gonorrhoeae with regulated PorB expression. We will test
whether OMVs containing decreasing levels of N. gonorrhoeae PorB exhibit reduced capacity to inhibit dendritic
cell-mediated T cell proliferation and whether immunization of mice with these OMVs results in increased cellular
immune responses against N. gonorrhoeae. These experiments will serve as an important step in the future
development of more effective OMV-based vaccines."
10988615,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myocarditis is a leading cause of sudden death in children and young adults but is understudied, especially in
children. Viral myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, has been found to involve both the innate and
adaptive immune response in adult myocarditis models, but before this study, there were no mouse models for
pediatric viral myocarditis; therefore, this is unstudied in the pediatric population. Our long-term goal is to
evaluate the development and progression of myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy, and heart failure across the
lifespan. Our overall objective of this application is to determine how the immune mechanisms differ between
pediatric and adult mice and patients leading to and during myocarditis. Our central hypothesis is that younger
pediatric mice and patients, before the onset of puberty, will develop a stronger innate and adaptive immune
response, leading to severe disease during myocarditis. This hypothesis will be tested with the following two
specific aims: 1) Identify the differences in immune biomarkers between pediatric and adult myocarditis
patients by sex and age. 2) Determine how age and hormone status alter the immune response, leading to
altered viral myocarditis severity in a translational mouse model by sex. Under the first aim, we will utilize 550
adult and pediatric patient blood samples/clinical data to investigate if patient age alters immune biomarkers
predicting disease severity based on cardiac function and/or standard laboratory values in myocarditis patients
by sex. For the second aim, we will first examine innate and adaptive immune mechanism differences
between pediatric and adult mice in myocarditis utilizing female and male 3-week, 4-week, and 8-week-old
mice. We will assess differences in the inflammasome, complement, and antibody response at 48, 5 days, and
10 days post-infection. Next, we will investigate the role of sex hormones in pediatric and adult mice to
determine if age differences are due to estrogen and testosterone changes during puberty and aging. We will
utilize gonadectomy at various ages to study the influence of hormones on innate and adaptive immune
responses in male and female mice. Additionally, we will utilize aged male mice and a VCD-induced ovarian
failure model in female mice to study the effect of menopause/andropause on myocarditis mechanisms. The
research proposed in this application is innovative because it departs from the status quo and studies the
differences between pediatric and adult mouse populations using the first pediatric viral myocarditis mouse
model. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify how the age of patients/mice
could influence the innate and adaptive immune response leading to myocarditis severity or progression. This
will have a positive impact as it is expected to significantly impact the myocarditis field by providing a
mechanistic understanding of how sex, age, and hormone status interplay in response to viral infection during
acute myocarditis and will lead to targeted treatments in an individualized manner and provide a better
understanding of pediatric disease."
10988509,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early life experiences, such as those associated with stable attachment, supportive relationships, and nurturing
environments, have profound effects on lifelong physical and mental health. However, children have very
different levels of access to such experiences, depending on their family characteristics and associated risk
and resilience factors. Low-cost interventions aimed at improving infant environments offer a promising avenue
for reducing inequality in early experiences because they require minimal effort to implement. Previous work
from our lab showed the promise of infant-directed vocalizations, especially music, for enriching parent-infant
interaction. Such behaviors are cross-culturally universal, appear regularly in the context of infant care, and
have robust effects on infant psychophysiology. In recently completed pilot work, we found that a brief
smartphone-based music intervention achieved high adherence and low attrition; led parents to increase their
use of music in soothing their fussy infants; and improved infant mood, as reported via ecological momentary
assessment (EMA). Together, these findings show the potential for enriched parent-infant interaction,
particularly via infant-directed singing, to improve infant and parent health. Here, we propose a Phase II
randomized trial to explore such effects. Parent/infant dyads (N = 192, infant starting ages 0 to 4 months) will
be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) music with enrichment, where parents receive a
smartphone-based intervention to learn to sing interactively with their infants, via the early childhood music
program Music Together; (2) music with limited enrichment, where parents receive music recordings to listen to
with their infants, but are not provided with enrichment activities; (3) enrichment with limited music, where
parents receive books to read interactively with their infants, but are not provided with music activities; or (4) a
no-treatment control. Throughout the 8-month study, we will use text-message-based EMA and a survey
battery to measure key health outcomes for both infants (distress and recovery, sleep quality, and mood) and
parents (mood, mental health status, and parenting efficacy); potential moderators of such effects
(demographics, family contextual factors, parent/infant attachment, and infant temperament); as well as
parents' degree of engagement in the interventions. Effects will be analyzed both across the intervention
groups and relative to the no-treatment control to determine the relative effects of each intervention. The
results of this work will determine the effects of low-cost, low-effort early enrichment interventions on basic,
everyday health outcomes for infants and parents, test the feasibility of app-based interventions and data
collection tools (including in socio-economically disadvantaged families), and provide rich data on the daily
lives (including mood, temperament, and sleep variables) of families with young infants. The findings will have
particular relevance for underprivileged families and first-time parents, and will set the stage for larger-scale
studies of early parent-infant enrichment."
10998819,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Overnutrition is central to the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease
(MASLD). This research proposal addresses the unanswered question of how molecular mechanisms that
normally promote energy conservation become maladaptive and promote MASLD in response to overnutrition.
The long-term goal of this research is to understand the regulatory relationships between cellular lipid
molecules and metabolism. The objective of this research is to understand fundamental mechanisms for the
regulation of energy homeostasis and nutrient metabolism. Our central hypothesis is that Them1 conserves
energy by limiting thermogenesis in brown and beige adipose tissue through its functions both as a lipid-
regulated enzyme that reduces rates of fatty acid oxidation, and as a transcriptional co-regulator. In obesity, we
postulate that Them1 becomes maladaptive. In addition to limiting energy expenditure in thermogenic adipose
tissue, high fat diet-induced Them1 upregulation in liver leads to steatosis and excess gluconeogenesis. The
rationale for the proposed research is that the mechanisms by which Them1 limits energy expenditure, while
promoting hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance, will reveal specific new targets for the management of
MASLD. Guided by extensive preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1)
To establish the mechanisms by which Them1 regulates triglyceride metabolism; 2) To elucidate transcriptional
regulation of nutrient homeostasis by Them1; and 3) To delineate lipid-mediated regulation of Them1 cellular
and enzymatic activities. In Aim 1, we will utilize biochemical and biophysical approaches to test the hypothesis
that dynamic formation of membrane free biomolecular condensates (puncta) and their dissolution in brown
adipose tissue provides a tissue-specific physiological mechanism for rapid suppression of thermogenesis. We
will define whether static puncta are responsible for Them1-mediated regulation of hepatic lipid droplets. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that enzymatically active Them1 within the nucleus regulates gene transcription. Using
mouse models and cell culture systems, we will leverage recombinant adeno-associated virus to express wild
type and Them1 mutant constructs that probe the influence of cellular localization and enzymatic activity on
gene transcription profiles. We will define nuclear interacting partners for Them1 in liver and brown adipose
tissue that contribute to the regulation of nutrient homeostasis. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that lipid
molecules bind and regulate the cellular localization and enzymatic activity of Them1. We will determine
whether bound lysophosphatidylcholines and fatty acids control the exposure and functional utility of a nuclear
localization signal located within the Them1 START domain. We will elucidate the allosteric control of Them1
activity by lipid binding. Overall, this proposal will elucidate Them1-mediated metabolic regulation, which is
significant because mechanisms that conserve energy in health may promote disease in response to
overnutrition. These studies are expected to identify therapeutic opportunities for the management of MASLD."
10998320,"Abstract:
Current 2D in vitro monocultures and animal models fall short in accurately modeling cardiovascular genetic
disorders, leading to inadequate therapeutic development. Recent advances have now centered on 3D organoid
models due to their improved cellular heterogeneity. However, cardiac organoids still lack crucial structural
characteristics, cell types, and cellular organization which limits their utility. While recent approaches focus on
modifying morphogens, none have used mechanical cues as guides for the differentiation process. Preliminary
data presented within reveal that microconfining stem cell colonies on compliant substrates facilitates cardiac
organoid generation and release, with substrate stiffness and geometric asymmetry influencing the spatial
organization of organoid structure. The research proposed in this fellowship will explore these findings further to
develop a roadmap for engineering-in the missing structural components. By modulating matrix mechanics, we
aim to replicate developmental stiffness, guiding traction stresses and cell polarization during early differentiation
stages. Gradients and temporal changes of stiffness may push towards cardiac mesoderm specification via
presentation of a more physiologically representative mechanical environment. Controlling local cell densities
and geometric confinement may further play a role in guiding final organoid architecture and cell heterogeneity
and distribution. Overall, the goal is this work is to establish a platform that can reproducibly create cardiac
organoids with tunable spatial control for drug screening applications, with scope for application towards other
organoid types."

 In September 2024, the 19th Northwest Reproductive Science Symposium (NWRSS) meeting will be
hosted by Oregon State University at the OSU-Cascades campus in Bend, OR. This long-standing series
began in 1989 as the Washington State University (WSU) and the University of Idaho (UI) annual joint
minisymposium, but now rotates biennially between WSU/UI, Oregon State University (OSU), and Oregon
Health & Science University (OHSU). The scientific program serves to showcase the high quality of regional
research in reproductive sciences, fertility and contraception, developmental biology, and animal and human
health. The objective of the NWRSS meeting is to promote the exchange of information to advance our
collective understanding of the mammalian reproductive tract both in normal function and in pathophysiological
dysfunction. Because most of the attendees are concentrated in the Pacific Northwest region, many lasting
collaborations arise from these gatherings. The NWRSS meeting also seeks to support career development
within all aspects of reproductive biology, enabling interaction between trainees, new investigators, and
established principal investigators. The training mission of the NWRSS extends to meeting organization as
well, as an ad hoc trainee committee from all participating schools is solely responsible for organizing the
scientific sessions into thematic groups, selection of trainee platform speakers, as well as serving as session
chairs during the meeting. The majority of NWRSS talks are delivered by post-doctoral fellows as well as
graduate and even undergraduate students. Similar to 2022, in addition to Keynote address from a preeminent
leader in the field of reproductive biology, invited speakers addressing health disparities in reproduction and
diversity in STEM fields will be featured. NWRSS organizers and participants are committed to providing a safe
and inclusive environment to foster the sharing of ideas between developmental biologists, molecular
biologists, systems biologists, population health biologists, and clinicians working in reproductive biology."
10980027,"Aging-related functional declines are thought to be caused by hallmark biological processes that ultimately
compromise healthspan and quality of life (QoL). Exercise is a multipotent treatment with promise to mitigate
most aging hallmarks, but there is substantial variability in individual exercise responsiveness. This inter-
individual response heterogeneity (IRH) was first identified in the context of endurance training (ET) and later
we established it with resistance training (RT). We propose the innovative, but logical, strategy to use combined
ET and RT aligned with HHS guidelines to maximize health benefits in aging adults. Low cardiorespiratory
fitness (CRF; VO2max) and low functional muscle quality (fMQ; strength/muscle mass) are multi-system
manifestations of the deterioration of the cellular hallmarks of aging. Importantly, both CRF and fMQ are
modifiable with ET and RT. Thus, our design premise is that combined ET+RT is an excellent strategy for
elucidating factors underlying IRH, as it forges a path toward understanding and mitigating IRH in aging with
direct translatability to best-evidence public health recommendations. While sources of IRH are a constellation
of modifiable and non-modifiable factors, we will test the hypothesis that factors central to aging itself – aging
hallmarks such as proteostasis, mitochondrial energetics, inflammation, and circadian clock function – are chief
contributors to the multidimensional circuitry that determines whether an individual achieves the minimum
clinically important difference (MCID) in CRF and/or fMQ with exercise training. We will also test the hypothesis
that altered exercise dosing coupled with lifestyle recommendations will promote attainment of MCIDs among
older adults who do not initially respond. With CRF and fMQ as primary clinical outcomes, we will use a 2-phase
Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) of combined ET+RT with clinical phenotyping and
blood/muscle molecular and cellular analyses. Specific Aim 1: Interrogation. In SMART Phase I, N=200
participants stratified by sex and age group (60-69 vs ≥70 y) will enable testing of both as biological variables.
After 12 wk of ET+RT including acute response studies, individual responder classification will be defined by
MCIDs for CRF and fMQ. The impact of aging hallmarks (muscle proteostasis, mitochondrial function,
inflammation, circadian clock function) will be determined, and we will decipher the multidimensional circuitry of
IRH via integrated modeling of: (i) targeted cellular/molecular outcomes; (ii) inter-tissue communication; (iii)
epigenomics; (iv) free-living behavior; and (v) clinical outcomes. Specific Aim 2: Mitigation. In SMART Phase
II (10 wk), individuals not attaining one or both MCIDs will undergo an additional 10 wk of training with targeted
augmentation. Those attaining both MCIDs in Phase I will be randomized to: (i) continue the supervised training;
or (ii) return to free-living. The latter will enable us to test sustainability over 10 wk. We anticipate these aims will
foster significant advances in the understanding of factors impacting exercise response variability among older
adults by determining the role of aging hallmarks and defining multidimensional circuitry of influential features."

The epidemic of child abuse in the U.S. (>675,000 confirmed annually) causes massive harm to
children and the adults they become. Sequelae include physical disabilities and neurological
damage, mental health problems, maladaptive behaviors, and perpetuating cycles of abuse.
Young children (ages 0–5 years) are particularly vulnerable to victimization. They account for
>75% of deaths from abuse and a greater proportion of victims than older children for all
categories of maltreatment except sexual abuse. Yet despite 8-12 million American children
being in childcare, early childhood professionals (ECPs) report fewer than 1% (~2,500) of all
substantiated cases of child abuse. Research shows that ECPs are not well-prepared to identify
at-risk children, and there is a widespread need for evidence-based interventions that improve
ECP reporting of suspected child abuse while also avoiding inappropriate reporting.
Our current 5-year study is evaluating the efficacy of an innovative educational intervention,
iLook Out for Child Abuse (iLookOut) at promoting and sustaining both knowledge and
behavior change with regard to concerns about child abuse. Grounded in an experiential
learning conceptual model, iLookOut is a multi-media, online intervention that engages
learners emotionally and cognitively using an interactive, video-based storyline that provides
education, challenges learners with decision points, and gives critical feedback. iLookOut uses
gamification strategies and simulation to promote experiential learning through problem-
solving. It also includes follow-up activities to promote retention and integration of new
knowledge and to help ECPs remain aware and engaged.
Prior studies demonstrate that iLookOut's Core Training significantly improves knowledge and
attitudes about reporting suspected child abuse and is well received by ECPs. To evaluate its
impact on sustaining knowledge and changing behavior, our current grant will administer
knowledge and behavioral measures before and after iLookOut's Core Training and its Advanced
Training. This Administrative Supplement will 1) resolve problems with data integrity by
transitioning to a new learning management system (LMS) in advance of beginning recruitment
for the current study; 2) enable iLookOut's Core Training and Micro-Learning interventions to
be deployed for the duration of the current grant period using this new LMS; and 3) help ensure
continued nationwide delivery of iLookOut programs to Head Start through the end of the
current grant period (through July 31, 2027 with an anticipated 1-year no-cost extension)."

Posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) refers to chronic unprovoked seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI),
and is a major clinical problem in both the military and civilian populations. Despite the importance of PTE,
the locus of where PTE develops relative to the site of head injury and thus the anatomy of development of
PTE in distributed brain networks is not well understood. Consequently, the physiological changes occurring
specifically in the PTE seizure focus underlying epilepsy have not been determined. Our long-term goal is
to identify mechanisms of PTE. The objective here is to determine the anatomic locus of PTE in the
controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI and to determine underlying cellular, molecular, and
physiological alterations accompanying PTE. Our central hypothesis is that following CCI, localized
molecular changes that impair astrocytic function and divergent injury-induced microcircuit reorganization of
intratelencepalic (IT) and extratelencepalic (ET) Layer 5 pyramidal cells (L5PCs) and hippocampal CA1
pyramidal cells (HPCs) underlie emergence of seizure foci. By using multielectrode array (MEA)
electroencephalography (EEG) to define the seizure focus at various time points after CCI and comparing
the molecular, cellular and circuit alterations in electrographically defined seizure foci in PTE mice with
corresponding loci in seizure-free injured mice, we will identify the cellular and circuit changes and
electrographic markers that predict transition to PTE. First, we will define the anatomic locus and
electrographic biomarkers of PTE onset in the animal model of controlled cortical impact (CCI) using
multielectrode array (MEA) electroencephalography (EEG). Second, we will determine which cellular and
molecular changes in the seizure focus underlie the onset of PTE. Third, we will identify cell-type specific
changes in L5PC (IT and ET) and HPC physiology and compromises in astrocytic transporter function that
underlie emergence of seizure foci. These experiments are anticipated to have a positive impact by
elucidating the necessary and sufficient changes in the brain underlying PTE and identifying new cellular and
molecular targets for treatment."

High frequency oscillations (HFOs) of intracranial EEG (iEEG) have the potential to identify the surgical resection
area/seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with drug resistant epilepsy. However, multiple reports indicate that
HFOs can be generated not only by epileptic cerebral tissue but also by non-epileptic sites often including
eloquent regions such as motor, visual and language cortices. In this project, we present the initial evidence of
a recurrent waveform pattern that may be sufficient to distinguish pathological HFOs from physiological ones.
Specifically, we show that the SOZ repeatedly generates sets of stereotypical HFOs with similar
waveform morphology whereas the events recorded from out of SOZ were irregular. This morphological
pattern served as a robust neurobiomarker to isolate SOZ from other brain areas in multiple patients
consistently. While these promising preliminary results are in place, the functional utility of stereotyped
HFOs in a closed-loop seizure control system remains unknown.
As of today, not much is known whether the stereotyped HFOs generated by the SOZ can be detected with an
implantable system. If this can be achieved, then HFOs can be strategically translated as a neurobiomarker into
closed-loop seizure control applications. We hypothesize that pathologic stereotyped HFOs can be captured
with the implantable Brain Interchange (BIC) system of CorTec and spatial topography of these events can be
utilized by the implantable system to deliver targeted electrical stimulation to achieve seizure control. Using an
acute setup within the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU), this project will investigate the feasibility of capturing
stereotyped HFO events using the new BIC system and compare the detection results to those obtained with
the commercially available amplifier. If the first phase (Aim-1) of our study becomes successful, later in the
second phase (Aim-2), once again in the EMU, we will deliver targeted electrical stimulation to those brain sites
associated with stereotyped HFOs using the BIC. We will investigate the modulatory effects of this closed-loop
stimulation strategy by monitoring the changes in signature events such as spikes, epileptic discharges, ripples
and fast ripples.
If successful, this closed-loop system does not have to wait for a seizure to start in order to deliver the stimulation
at its onset as done by the RNS system of Neuropace. In contrast, the system will monitor the spatial topography
and rate of stereotyped HFOs and deliver targeted stimulation to these areas to prevent seizures from occurring.
If the outcomes of our research in acute setting become successful, we will execute a clinical trial and run our
methods with the implanted BIC system in a chronic ambulatory setting.

10997069,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a crucial DNA repair pathway that removes bulky and helical-distorting
lesions (e.g., UV damage) from the genome. NER has two subpathways: Transcription Coupled NER (TC-
NER), which repairs damage on the transcribed strand when RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) is stalled by the
damage, and Global Genomic NER (GG-NER), which repairs damage everywhere else in the genome when
damage is recognized by XPC/UV-DDB proteins. After damage recognition, these subpathways converge with
the recruitment of Transcription Factor IIH (TFIIH), a 10-subunit protein complex responsible for unwinding the
DNA strands to allow DNA incision on the damaged strand. The DNA unwinding function is conducted by XPD,
a DNA helicase in TFIIH, with the assistance of other subunits. Mutations of the XPD gene are associated with
two genetic disorders: Xeroderma Pigmentosum (XP) and Xeroderma Pigmentosum in combination with
Cockayne Syndrome (XP/CS). XP is characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV light and predisposition to skin
cancer. XP/CS is characterized by neurodegeneration and predisposition to skin cancer. While the
relationship between XPD and human genetic disorders has long been established, why mutations in
the same gene cause clinically distinct phenotypes is currently unclear. The objective of this F31
proposal is to determine DNA repair defects caused by XPD mutations, thereby providing mechanistic insights
into XP and XP/CS symptoms associated with the mutated XPD gene. We have identified a difference
between XP and XP/CS mutants in the overall repair capacity of UV damage using yeast as the model system.
This led to my hypothesis that XPD mutations associated with XP or XP/CS differentially affect GG- and TC-
NER. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will use cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer sequencing (CPD-seq), a genome-
wide and strand-specific UV damage sequencing technique, to identify defects in GG- and TC-NER in XPD
mutant cells. Repair defects in GG- and TC-NER could be due to impairment in TFIIH’s DNA helicase activity.
In Aim 2, I will purify TFIIH protein complex and conduct in vitro biochemical assays to investigate how each
XPD mutation impacts TFIIH’s helicase function in DNA unwinding. The neurodegeneration symptom in CS
patients is linked with insufficient repair of endogenous small base damage (e.g., oxidative and alkylation);
however, the involvement of TFIIH in this repair pathway has not been analyzed previously. In Aim 3 I will
determine the impact of XPD mutations on the repair of non-helix-distorting alkylation damage using N-
methylpurine sequencing (NMP-seq), a novel sequencing technique developed by our lab. Overall, I will utilize
multidisciplinary approaches, including genomics, bioinformatics, and biochemistry to tackle a long-standing
question in the DNA repair field. Completion of this project will provide new insights into the mechanism for
NER-associated human diseases."

Food insecurity is a strong mediator in the relationship between poverty and breast cancer mortality in the United
States. National data has identified adult women experiencing food insecurity have 54% lower odds of reporting
breast cancer screening in the past two years when compared with food secure women. Counties with very high
levels of food insecurity are significantly associated with later-stage breast cancer among women ages 65 and
older. Early detection reduces breast cancer mortality rates and increases the likelihood of better treatment
options. However, higher food insecurity has been associated with delayed utilization of, and reduced adherence
to, recommended medical care among individuals and communities. Partnering with existing community
programs that offer supplemental food assistance may provide an opportunity to encourage breast cancer
screening in this harder-to-reach population. The proposed study will apply community-engaged research
methods to improve access to breast cancer screening among a marginalized population that is
experiencing food insecurity. The central hypothesis is that addressing barriers to breast cancer screening
promotion for diverse communities of women with food insecurity can increase screening uptake, ultimately
improving cancer health equity. We will test our hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: (1) Identify barriers
and facilitators to implementing a cancer prevention intervention in a food distribution setting; (2) Develop a
tailored community-based cancer prevention intervention to promote breast cancer screening among women
with
food insecurity; and (3) Evaluate the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the community-based
intervention promoting breast cancer screening among women with food insecurity. To achieve Aim 1, I will
collect qualitative data about food bank distribution events and the clients served using participant observation
with semi-structured fieldnotes and interviews (n=20) and directed content analysis guided by the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research to gain an in-depth understanding of factors and elucidate mechanisms
that impact implementation. For Aim 2, I will use Intervention Mapping as a systematic process for planning a
community-based intervention to promote breast cancer screening among diverse women who are served by
the food bank. For Aim 3, I will conduct a pilot study of the intervention with the food bank, then survey women
ages 40-74 years (n=50) to evaluate select implementation outcomes. This research stands to significantly
improve the understanding of food insecurity as a social determinant of cancer health and provide an
implementation model to promote cancer prevention with this at-risk population. The training plan will be
facilitated by the mentorship of my sponsor and the exceptional facilities at UC Davis. This proposal describes
an integrative and comprehensive training plan to support scientific and professional development and propel
me toward my long-term goal of becoming an independent public health researcher."
10996785,"Project Summary/Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is classically characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons leading
to the emergence of debilitating motor, and non-motor symptoms. As the CNS does not replace neurons lost
to injury or disease, a primary focus in developing therapeutic strategies for PD has centered around the idea
of grafting replacement dopaminergic neurons. Early neurosurgical approaches using fetal ventral midbrain
allografts produced some mixed, but encouraging results. As fetal donor tissue presents challenges in regard
to sourcing and ethics, variability, immunogenicity, and cost, recent efforts have focused on the prospect of
using induced pluripotent cells driven to a dopaminergic neuronal fate. The advantages of this precision
medicine approach, where the patient’s own cells are engineered into the replacement neurons, is offset by the
effort and cost to produce and differentiate cells under cGMP conditions, with the ultimate delivery requiring
invasive neurosurgery. We propose to bypass the need to generate dopaminergic neurons exogenously, by
using an alternative approach where glial progenitor cells already present in the Parkinson’s patient’s brain
could be directly reprogrammed to become dopaminergic neurons. In exploring this approach, access to adult
human glial progenitor cells from non-affected or PD-patients is a limitation and reprogramming of adult human
glial progenitor cells into dopaminergic neurons has not yet been reported. We have successfully targeted rat
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in vivo to reprogram them into a neuronal lineage. With this
Exploratory/Developmental R21 mechanism award, we propose to lineage reprogram human OPCs into
dopaminergic neurons to ultimately replace neurons lost in PD. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that PD-
derived fibroblasts directly reprogrammed into human OPCs without passing through a pluripotent state retain
their epigenetic signature and can model the human OPCs we eventually intend to target for neuronal
replacement in the PD brain. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that temporal sequential reprogramming can direct
adult-derived human OPCs from non-affected and PD-patients to become dopamine neurons. These in vitro
studies, determining the timing and sequence of lineage specification instructions to generate dopaminergic
neurons, will lay the necessary foundation for the future step using direct in vivo delivery to model a
reprogramming neuronal replacement therapy for PD. This project also has implications for testing the
capacity to drive the generated human OPCs to complete differentiation as oligodendrocytes and to then
address myelination deficiencies in Parkinson’s disease."

 Adoptive transfer of engineered T cells targeting tumor antigens is ineffective against most solid tumors,
due in-part to poor persistence and the rapid onset of dysfunction. Recent studies of endogenous tumor-
specific T cells (Endog-T) have described a population of stem-like PD-1+Tcf1+ progenitor exhausted T cells
(Tpex) that can self-renew and differentiate into effector-like T cells in the tumor. Tpex preferentially reside in
tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs), where they are maintained through activation by dendritic cells (DCs).
Importantly, Tpex in TdLNs are necessary for promoting persistent and functional T cell responses, as well as
conferring response to PD-L1 blockade. However, it is not clear whether engineered T cells form PD-1+Tcf1+
populations in TdLNs, and how this impacts their long-term persistence and function in the tumor.
 To test this, I adapted the clinically relevant KrasG12D-LSL/+;p53fl/fl murine model (KP) of lung adenocarcinoma
to overexpress the model neoantigen Ovalbumin (Ova) to compare Ova-specific engineered T cells (TCR-T)
and Endog-T cells. While the majority of Endog-T cells in TdLNs were PD-1+Tcf1+, TCR-T cells were
predominantly PD-1-Tcf1+, markers associated with lack of activation and maintenance of a pre-exhausted
central-memory phenotype. Consistent with these phenotypes, PD-L1 blockade failed to increase numbers of
TCR-T cells and enhance tumor control in comparison to Endog-T. Thus, I hypothesize that factors unique to
TCR-T therapy, such as their in vitro pre-activation and/or infusion at a high cell number, promote their
formation of PD-1-Tcf1+ reservoirs in TdLNs instead of PD-1+Tcf1+. I also hypothesize that formation of PD-1-
Tcf1+ reservoirs in the TdLN is actually an advantage for TCR-T therapy, since the PD-1-Tcf1+ population may
possess superior functional potential that can be mobilized through vaccination targeting DCs in the TdLN.
 In this project, I seek to determine 1) why TCR-T cells form PD-1-Tcf1+ reservoirs in TdLNs instead of PD-
1+Tcf1+ like what is described for Endog-T, as well as 2) whether the PD-1-Tcf1+ TCR-T cells in the TdLN have
stem-like characteristics and functional potential that can be unleashed with vaccination. In Aim 1, I will use
fluorescently-labeled tumors in the KP model, flow cytometry, and high-parameter fluorescence microscopy to
determine how infusion of a large number of cells and/or in vitro pre-activation affect TCR-T cell formation of
PD-1+Tcf1+ populations in TdLNs, and how this correlates with their localization near DCs. In Aim 2, I will use
RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ex vivo assays to describe the stem-ness and functional potential of the PD-1-Tcf1+
TCR-T cells in the TdLN compared to PD-1+Tcf1+ Endog-T. I will also evaluate whether a novel T cell
vaccination approach targeting DCs in TdLNs can activate PD-1-Tcf1+ TCR-T cells to promote tumor control.
 Through this work, I will define the mechanisms by which TCR-T cells form Tcf1+ stem-like reservoirs in
TdLNs and potentially identify a therapeutic strategy to enhance TCR-T efficacy by targeting these reservoirs
that could be translated to the clinic to improve patient outcomes."

We intend to request funds to help support the 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Cell Death to be
held July 28-August 2, 2024 and its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) to be held July 26-27,
2024 at the
Jordon Hotel at Sunday River, US
. The Cell Death GRC is among the most highly regarded
international conferences in the cell death community. Participants will give oral presentations, lead
discussions or present their work in poster format. In keeping with the intimate spirit of the Gordon
Conference, attendance will be limited, and presentations will feature unpublished work at the leading edge of
this field. The overall goal of this conference is to expedite progress in cell death research and to use research
findings for the development of new anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer therapies. A secondary goal is to
facilitate collaborations among cell death researchers and investigators in complementary basic, translational
and clinical fields. The “Power Hour” during the GRC will provide a platform to address challenges trainees at
all levels encounter, especially for those who are from under-privileged minority groups. The GRS target
audience are students and postdoctoral trainees. The GRS provides trainees with the opportunity to present
their work in a more peer-to-peer setting. The GRS will also have a few established faculties from industry and
academia who will provide career counseling and advice to the trainees. We believe the GRS will provide the
platform to help trainees launch their own independent research career.
The aims of this conference are to: 1) gather established experts, junior scientists and researchers new to this
field in a setting that supports structured and casual interactions. 2) promote exchange of cutting edge,
innovative and unpublished science relevant to the roles of cell death in healthy and pathologic contexts. 3)
expedite discoveries that advance mechanistic knowledge on cell death and facilitate clinical opportunities for
the treatment and diagnosis of diseases caused by the dysregulation of this process.
The major themes of the meeting will focus on: 1) fundamental mechanisms of different cell death modalities,
2) cell death in inflammatory disorders, 3) host-pathogen interactions, 4) the cross-talk between cell death and
immunity, 5) Targeting cell death mechanisms in disease, 6) Inflammation and tissue homeostasis. The
meeting will facilitate the alignment of recent breakthrough discoveries with the development of new therapies
for infections, immunological disorders, and cancers."

VEXAS (Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome is a newly identified severe
autoinflammatory and hematologic disorder with high mortality caused by somatic mutations in UBA1. Estimated
1/14,000 people are affected by VEXAS syndrome in the US, yet there is no effective treatments and limited
insight into pathogenic mechanisms to date. In this proposal, I will characterize the disease progression in the
newly established VEXAS mouse models to investigate the molecular mechanisms of inflammation by loss of
UBA1.
UBA1 is an E1 enzyme responsible for initiating the majority of cellular ubiquitylation, and is essential for
development. UBA1 mutations in VEXAS patients are acquired within hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and
multipotent progenitor cells, but lineage-restricted in myeloid and mostly absent in lymphoid lineages. Our
previous study showed that the most common UBA1 mutations result in loss of cytoplasmic isoform (UBA1b)
and appearance of a catalytically deficient isoform (UBA1c), which correlated with decreased ubiquitylation and
an increased in the unfolded protein response. Additional disease-causing mutations have revealed that
hypomorphic activity of UBA1 can also lead to disease. There have been extensive efforts made by our lab and
others to establish the VEXAS disease models from patients’ cells to study the mechanisms, but none of them
was adequate to follow the progression of the disease. Loss of Uba1b in zebrafish resulted in upregulation in
inflammatory signals recapitulating human disease, yet these animals die prematurely after birth, which imposes
significant limitations in investigating the pathogenic mechanism of the disease. Therefore, it is necessary to
establish the mouse models to recapitulate the somatic mutations in a cell type specific manner to analyze
disease progression.
We have recently generated and characterized the Uba1 transgenic mouse lines which conditionally removes
all isoforms of Uba1 (Uba1flox/flox) and introduces VEXAS specific Uba1 mutation (Rosa26-Lox-Stop-Lox-
Uba1M41V), mirroring the isoform swap present in humans, and have demonstrated that these animals have
systemic inflammation. By removing UBA1 functions from HSCs and recapitulating VEXAS syndrome in these
mouse models, I will define the role of UBA1 in bone marrow physiology and identify which blood lineages are
dependent on Uba1 and cause inflammation (Aim1). I will further investigate the role of cytosolic isoform of
UBA1, Uba1b, which is diminished in UBA1 mutant myeloid cells and inversely correlates with severity of VEXAS
syndrome in patients (Aim2). Overall, the proposed project aims to advance our understanding of function of
UBA1 in disease, which will provide the fundamental basis to build effective therapeutic strategy to treat VEXAS
patients."
10998986,"Ovarian cancer patients are burdened with a lack of effective therapeutic options resulting in a low survival rate
due to chemotherapy resistance, recurrence, and metastasis. The overall goal of the proposed project is to
establish innovative anti-cancer drug targets by mapping mechanical regulators of ovarian cancer progression.
Cancer metastasis requires cells to deform and migrate through confined spaces. To survive, cancer cells must
sense physical forces and adapt to maintain cellular and nuclear mechanical homeostasis. If we could map the
mechanical regulators of cancer cells—molecules that control cell deformability and migration—this would
enable us to define novel, complementary treatment strategies. To identify novel mechanical regulators, we
developed a high throughput deformability screen that tested the effects of 1280 compounds (Library of
Pharmacologically Active Compounds) on the deformability of human high-grade serous ovarian cancer
(OVCAR5) cells. Our screen revealed drug compounds that reduced cell deformability. A meta-analysis across
top drug hits revealed NUDT5 as a predicted regulator of cellular mechanical behaviors. NUDT5 is a member of
the Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X) hydrolase superfamily. Our preliminary analyses revealed
NUDT5 is highly expressed in various cancer types compared to normal tissue. My preliminary data shows that
NUDT5 regulates cell stiffness, morphology, and migration in OVCAR5 cells.
The goal of my project is to test
the hypothesis that NUDT5 drives ovarian cancer progression by regulating cancer cell mechanical behaviors.
In Aim 1, I will assess how NUDT5 relates to ovarian cancer progression by measuring NUDT5 expression and
localization at different disease stages in distinct histological subtypes, including high-grade serous (HGSOC)
and clear cell (OCCC) carcinoma tumors using patient tissue microarrays. I will also examine in vitro how NUDT5
regulates PARP inhibitor resistance and ovarian cancer cell behaviors, such as proliferation, migration, spheroid
formation, and invasion. In Aim 2, I will determine the role of NUDT5 activity in catalyzing ATP production for
actin cytoskeletal and nuclear remodeling following confined migration. Understanding how NUDT5 regulates
cancer cell mechanical behaviors will guide future clinical treatment strategies to improve patient survival."

Craniofacial malformations represent the largest category of birth defects and a major expense to the healthcare
system and affected families. As craniofacial morphogenesis is complex and requires the coordinated interplay
of several cellular pathways, mutations in many genes in these pathways can give rise to craniofacial defects.
Coiled coil domain containing protein 32 (CCDC32) is an understudied gene recently found to underlie a
craniofacial syndrome known as Cardiofacioneurodevelopmental Syndrome (CFNDS). Patients with defective
CCDC32 exhibit a number of morphological abnormalities including bilateral cleft lip/palate, hypo- or
hypertelorism, and microcephaly among others. Preliminary cellular data have shown CCDC32’s involvement in
endocytosis and ciliogenesis, although molecular data to explain these functions is lacking. I have found that
CCDC32 interacts with the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP2), a key factor in regulating endocytosis, via two well
characterized motifs and exhibits the novel function of disassembling this complex. Moreover, I discovered
CCDC32 binds the related AP3 complex, which is involved in trafficking throughout the Golgi and endolysosomal
compartments. My preliminary data shows that knocking down CCDC32 in cells results in defects in intracellular
trafficking including abnormal and reversible accumulation of ciliary components, and previously unobserved
ciliary assembly dynamics. I hypothesize that CCDC32 promotes ciliary maintenance via AP3, and also regulates
ciliary function via AP2. My approach will use cellular, biochemical, and structural methods to address the
molecular mechanism of CCDC32’s role in endocytosis and ciliary assembly. In Aim 1, I will characterize the
membrane trafficking interactions of CCDC32 that regulate ciliary maintenance. To determine a role for
AP3 in intracellular ciliary trafficking, I will knock down AP3 in cells and observe cilia dynamics. To determine the
molecular mechanism of CCDC32 interaction, I will determine a high-resolution CryoEM structure of the AP3-
CCDC32 complex. To confirm the cellular importance of this interaction, I will use targeted mutagenesis to disrupt
complex assembly in vivo. In Aim 2, I will determine how AP2-mediated endocytosis supports CCDC32’s
role in ciliary function. CCDC32 and AP2 both promote endocytosis and bind one another, although the
necessity and nature of this interaction has not been established. To assess an AP2-dependent function for
CCDC32 in endocytosis, I will use targeted mutagenesis in vivo. I have also shown that CCDC32 disassembles
AP2. To elucidate this novel mechanism, I will obtain CryoEM structures of CCDC32 with AP2 alpha/sigma. I will
validate that AP2 disassembly occurs at membranes using biochemical reconstitution. To understand the effect
of CCDC32 on endocytosis at the cilium, I will use TIRF endocytosis assays. Via these experiments, I will build
the first molecular model of CCDC32 in cilia biology. This study will impact basic research on ciliary maintenance
and membrane trafficking, and on health and disease research in craniofacial disorders like CFNDS."

Introduction: Immunity to Cryptosporidium diarrhea develops by four years of age in children living in an area of
high transmission intensity.
Hypothesis: Children upon repeated infection develop immunity in part via a unique repertoire and functional
capacity of antibodies against the parasite due to Tfh cell activation.
Significance: The proposal will provide insight into the human immune system response to intraepithelial
parasitism and inform vaccine design to prevent the estimated 7 million Cryptosporidium-attributable cases of
diarrhea, 200,000 deaths annually in children under the age of 2 years.
Investigators: The application is the product of 25 years of collaboration between Drs. Petri & Gilchrist at the
University of Virginia and Dr. Haque at icddr,b in Bangladesh, joined by Dr. Campo at Antigen Discovery.
Innovation: The hypothesis is innovative as it challenges the existing paradigm that humoral immunity is
unimportant in immunity to cryptosporidiosis. Innovative approaches include the longitudinal study of infection of
children in an area of high transmission intensity, probing humoral immunity with a parasite protein microarray
and functional measures, and activation-induced marker (AIM) assays of Tfh function during active infection.
Progress over the last 5 years of funding: 51 papers published, demonstrating the acquisition of immunity to
cryptosporidiosis in children living in a high transmission area, identification of 7/233 parasite antigens
recognized by immune sera as associated with protection, discovery of protection from both malnutrition and
cryptosporidiosis with an anti-parasite Cp23 protein antibody response, identification of human genetic
susceptibility via a polymorphism in protein kinase C, evidence of parasite genotype-specific antibody responses,
the importance of the microbiome and prior antibiotics, and transmission during monsoon and within households.

Specific Aim 1 (ADI & UVA): In Depth Characterization of Cryptosporidium Antigens Recognized by the
Humoral Immune Response as Children Develop Immunity from Repeated Infections.
Specific Aim 2 (UVA & ADI): Functional Characterization of Anti-Cryptosporidium Antibodies.
Specific Aim 3 (UVA & icddr,b): Role of T follicular helper (Tfh) Cells in Induction of the Antibody Response.
Environment: The University of Virginia is internationally recognized as a center for Global Health research, the
icddr,b is the premier institution for the study of diarrheal diseases in low and middle income countries, and ADI
Inc. is a leader in protein microarrays."
10999061,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Maintenance of DNA integrity and information is essential for cell viability and genome stability. Various
extrinsic and intrinsic sources of DNA damage induce an especially detrimental form of lesion to chromosomes
known as double-strand breaks (DSBs). Repairing these breaks in pericentromeric heterochromatin is uniquely
challenging. Heterochromatin is mostly composed of repeated DNA sequences, and the availability of up to
millions of potential donor sequences associated with different chromosomes can trigger abnormal
recombination during homologous recombination (HR) repair. Some of the most important components
required for heterochromatin repair are commonly deregulated in cancer and other genome instability
disorders, suggesting heterochromatin repair defects as major contributors for these diseases. Understanding
the molecular mechanisms of heterochromatin repair and genome stability is essential for understanding how
environmental exposure to DNA damaging agents induce cancer and why individual sensitivity varies. We will
work with the D. melanogaster cell line model system, where the organization of heterochromatin in a distinct
domain and established approaches greatly facilitate the study of the molecular mechanisms involved. We will
also extend our studies to mouse and human cells, to establish conserved pathways. We previously identified
a unique pathway enabling ‘safe’ HR repair of heterochromatic DSBs, where repair starts inside the
heterochromatin domain, but it continues only after relocalization of repair sites to the nuclear periphery. A
critical regulator of this pathway is the SUMO protease Ulp1, which is required for restarting repair at the
nuclear periphery through unknown targets. We propose to gain insights into this function, by: i) establishing
the importance of Ulp1 compartmentalization to the nuclear periphery in the spatial and temporal regulation of
heterochromatin repair; ii) identifying functional Ulp1 partners responsible for HR restart at the nuclear
periphery; and iii) identifying Ulp1 targets for heterochromatin repair. This work will provide a deeper
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms protecting repeated DNAs from massive aberrant
recombination and chromosomal rearrangements and illuminate a missing link between HR progression and
the stability of repeated DNA sequences. I expect this research will provide a better understanding of the
mechanisms through which environmental exposures result in genomic instability and cancer, and to enable
the development of better strategies for prevention and treatment."

Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a complex and aggressive disease that requires
multidisciplinary care and has a poor prognosis at advanced stages. Moreover, OSCC is the only site of head
and neck cancer that exhibits significant racial disparities, with African ancestry (AA) patients having worse
survival than European ancestry (EA) patients. However, the causes of these survival disparities are poorly
understood due to the scarcity of AA-OSCC patient data, which hinders the development of better treatments
to address the disparities. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose to conduct a comprehensive and novel study
on AA-OSCC patients, using our unique dataset from the University of Maryland Medical Center/Greenebaum
Comprehensive Cancer Center, which has a high head and neck cancer patient volume and has built one of
the most comprehensive, annotated, racially diverse clinical databases. We will also use additional samples
and data from the Yale Head and Neck Biorepository from Yale Cancer Center to enhance patient
representation. We will analyze 163 AA-OSCC and 836 EA-OCSS cases in this project. We will perform multi-
scale analyses of AA-OSCC samples/patients to evaluate their unique clinical, biological, pathology, imaging,
and socioeconomic characteristics relative to EA-OSCC samples/patients. Our central hypothesis is that
differential biological, physiological, and socioeconomic factors drive race-based survival disparities
in OSCC, leading to pathway abnormalities, differential responses to the therapeutic intervention, and
overall poorer survival. To test our hypothesis, we have designed the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1:
Compare biological differences between AA-OSCC and EA-OSCC patients and assess the role of biological
factors in patients’ survival. Specific Aim 2: Determine imaging biomarkers for survival prediction among AA-
OSCC and EA-OSCC patients. Specific Aim 3: Identify socioeconomic factors related to overall, disease-
specific, and recurrence-free survival among AA-OSCC and EA-OSCC. By integrating the results from these
three aims using artificial intelligence methods, we will produce the first comprehensive study on the AA-OSCC
population. This study will reveal the unique characteristics of AA-OSCC and functionally examine the potential
therapeutic targets and pathways that are activated in AA-OSCC. We will thoroughly investigate different
aspects of the patient data, including biology, imaging, and socioeconomic/clinical data, and synergize the
findings to develop a systematic approach to address disparities. Our research will help identify key prognostic
and/or predictive biomarkers that will be leveraged to advance clinical studies of novel therapeutics or
alternative treatment strategies to improve outcomes of AA-OSCC to reduce disparities. This project will also
advance the field of precision medicine for OSCC by incorporating ancestry information into personalized
diagnosis and treatment strategies."

Delirium exposes patients to a greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, and patients with
Alzheimer’s disease and dementia are more likely to develop delirium. Delirium among elderly patients is
dangerous and common, yet it is underdiagnosed and undertreated. Especially common in patients with
Alzheimer’s disease, delirium is a strong predictor of poor outcomes including post-operative cognitive decline
(POCD) and mortality. The key to reducing the burden associated with delirium is early identification of those at
high risk for it, especially prior to surgery, which is known to be a major risk factor for delirium. However, currently,
there are no reliable tools available to predict the risk of post-operative delirium (POD). Also, there is no clear
understanding of the pathophysiological mechanism of delirium. The long-term goal of this project is to
investigate the role of epigenetics to better understand the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis of POD and
to identify potential biomarkers associated with POD and POCD. We will test for a specific type of epigenetic
modification, DNA methylation (DNAm), which is known to be induced by environmental factors. Previous
searches for biomarkers of delirium in humans led to the proposal that inflammation and pro-inflammatory
cytokines play a key role in the pathophysiology of delirium. Yet, how the aging process enhances cytokine
release remains unclear. Aging is known to have a strong effect on gene expression, and such changes in gene
expression are tightly controlled by DNAm. Thus, it is suspected that DNAm changes over the course of aging,
leading to enhanced cytokine release due to altered control of gene expression, and that such DNAm
modification contributes to delirium. This project will be the first to investigate the role of epigenetics associated
with POD in humans, and the objective of the project is to identify potential biomarkers for elevated risk of POD
and subsequent patient outcomes related to delirium such as POCD and dementia. The proposed research will
accomplish its objective by following a large sample of elderly patients going through hip fracture surgery
throughout their hospital stay, comparing differences in genome-wide DNAm between those who develop POD
and those who do not. Lastly, the project will test if DNAm is predictive of patient outcomes including survival
and long-term memory problem after surgery. This research will enhance our understanding of the epigenetic
mechanisms in the pathogenesis of delirium and its interplay with the progression of dementia, and may identify
biomarkers predictive of their risk. The identification of epigenetic markers of delirium would hopefully lead to
improvement in medical and surgical practice."

Disadvantaged neighborhoods are important predictors of internalizing and externalizing behaviors
(INT/EXT) in children, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, and conduct problems. Critically,
however, neighborhoods are neither static nor unidimensional. Rather, they evolve and change over
time, and may do so differentially across built, social, and toxicant domains. What’s more, although
neighborhoods are virtually always considered as endogenous variables, they are themslves active
products of human investment and selection, among other forces. In an effort to address these
complexities, researchers argue for the importance of quantifying the neighborhood ‘exposome’
across multiple sources and types of data (e.g., sensors, geographic information systems, remotely
sensed imagery, and conventional surveys), and to do so taking into account the emergent qualities of
neighborhoods over time as well as their historical antecedents. With this call in mind, we hypothesize
that historical structural racism (i.e., redlining, higway construction, blockbusting) has had cascading
effects on the neighborhood exposome which, in turn, influences modern-day child INT/EXT. To date,
however, virtually no studies have examined the effects of historical structural racism on either the
neighborhood exposome or on child INT/EXT. The proposed R01 aims to fill crucial gaps in our
knowledge base, augmenting two well-characterized and independent datasets with state-of-the-
science geospatial data collections and analytic techniques to evaluate i) historical structural racism’s
legacy for neighborhood trajectories over time, ii) the role of historical structural racism in modern-day
child INT/EXT, with a focus on children of color, and iii) the linkages between historical structural
racism, the neighborhood exposome, and child INT/EXT. Our first sample consists of ~3800 children
identifying as Black or multiracial and residing in (sub)urban areas across Michigan, as well as
roughly 10,000 additional children residing in rural areas and/or identifying as White. Our second
sample consists of ~1,000 intensively assessed child families that were specifically oversampled to
reside in economically disadvantaged neighborhood contexts. As part of the proposed grant, we will
collect geospatial assessments of historical structural racism (1930-1980) and the neighborhood
exposome (2000-2020) in Michigan, and link these data to existing child INT/EXT data in our two
datasets. The core question we will answer is: What are the modern-day consequences of
historical structural racism for neighborhoods and their youngest residents?"

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious public health concern affecting adolescent girls and young women
(AGYW) in South Africa, with a cumulative incidence of physical or sexual IPV among AGYW aged 15-19
years of 37%. IPV is also a significant contributor to the HIV epidemic among women globally and in South
Africa, where young women with violent or controlling male partners are 1.5 times as likely to acquire HIV.
Biomedical HIV prevention options that do not require participation from both partners, such as antiretroviral
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), are critical. Further, providing options for approved long-acting PrEP (LA-
PrEP) modalities, including the dapivirine ring and long‐acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA), for AGYW
who perceive barriers to daily oral PrEP use, may provide IPV-exposed AGYW in South Africa with greater
agency over their sexual health. Pathways for entry to PrEP care from existing public health touchpoints that
engage with AGYW who report experiencing IPV (e.g., rape crisis centers, centers for women and children) are
not currently available. However, integrating discussions surrounding HIV prevention into existing IPV care can
ultimately serve a population experiencing intersectional stigma to address both IPV and HIV risk. The current
project proposes to conduct formative work to develop a multi-component implementation strategy to link
South African AGYW who experience IPV with PrEP options, including LA-PrEP. Guided by the Exploration,
Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment framework and the Health Belief Model, this study aims to conduct
qualitative in-depth interviews and a brief cross-sectional survey among IPV-exposed AGYW (AIM 1) and key
informants (AIM 2), including potential program implementers and policymakers, to investigate 1) knowledge
and opinions of PrEP; 2) preferences for approved PrEP modalities (e.g., oral PrEP, the dapivirine ring, and
CAB-LA); 3) perceived barriers/facilitators to PrEP uptake and adherence among IPV-exposed AGYW; and 4)
inner and outer setting factors influencing PrEP delivery. Participants will be asked about barriers/facilitators to
PrEP uptake, adherence, and delivery relative to evidence-based PrEP-linkage strategies (e.g., providing
education and/or training, placing a peer navigator at touchpoints, care integration), and suggestions for novel
strategies will also be explored. Additionally, we will probe participants to discuss the role that stigma may play
in PrEP implementation to inform potential resilience resources that can be incorporated into the strategy. This
formative work will be used in AIM 3 to develop a multi-component PrEP-linkage implementation strategy
through iterative consultation with established community advisory board members, including AGYW, local
community members, advocates, service providers, and other key stakeholders (AIM 3), that will be tested in a
future pilot trial. In summary, this research aims to respond to AGYW in a generalized HIV epidemic setting
who are experiencing IPV by optimizing the implementation of approved PrEP modalities. Findings will
ultimately contribute to knowledge on biomedical HIV prevention implementation among priority populations."

Funds are requested to support trainee participation at the 33rd Biennial Cornea Conference to be held at the
Champalimaud Foundation in Lisbon, Portugal on October 4-5, 2024. The program for the conference was
developed by the co-chairs Dr. Ula Jurkunas, MD, Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical
School, Dr. Reza Dana, MD, MPH, Claes H. Dohlman Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School,
and an organizing committee of 27 experts in the field of Cornea from around the world. The program builds on
the success of the previous 32 conferences, first started in the 1960s, but moves the conference to Europe for
the first time in its history. Though there are large conferences that US trainees attend in the states, this
conference is focused on the subspecialty of Cornea and its European location will expose them to even more
experts from around Europe and Asia. Despite advancements in the field, corneal disease and blindness
remain common causes of vision loss and impairment worldwide and across all age groups. It is imperative to
better understand the mechanisms behind corneal disease development and to develop new methods of
diagnosis and treatment. The goals of this conference are to create an opportunity for discussion and for the
formation of collaborations aimed at elucidating the mechanisms that underlie the development of various
ocular surface and corneal diseases, and to provide trainees in the field an opportunity to present their
research and meet leaders in the field. Sessions on the ocular surface, the endothelium & Fuchs dystrophy,
stroma/regenerative therapies, transplantation & eye banking, and innovation and new technologies are
planned. Though panelists are still being determined by the committee, panel discussions on controversies in
corneal pathobiology, and innovation & new technologies have been planned. We anticipate at least 70 poster
presentations that will allow trainees the opportunity to present their research to all conference attendees,
receive immediate feedback, and engage leading experts in cornea in conversation over their work. As is
tradition, the conference honors an accomplished physician scientist and a scientist with the two named
lectures. Dr. Carlos Belmonte, MD, PhD will give the Claes H. Dohlman Lecture and Dr. Victor Perez, MD, will
give the J. Wayne Streilein Lecture. The anticipated attendance for the conference is 250 physicians,
scientists, and trainees. We intend to provide travel awards to attract graduate students and fellows and will
make every attempt to make the conference free of charge for all trainees."
10999076,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease characterized by abnormally elevated
pulmonary pressures and right heart failure resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The pathologic hallmark of
PAH is progressive loss and obstructive remodeling of lung microvessels unresponsive to available therapies.
Studies by our group and others have shown that pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) derived
from PAH patients are highly susceptible to apoptosis and have a lower capacity to form blood vessels (i.e.,
angiogenesis). Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is an essential energy source for PMVECs that requires metabolic
coupling of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Metabolic reprogramming characterized by high
glycolysis, reduced FAO, and mitochondrial/ER dysfunction is a key pathological feature of PAH PMVECs linked
to oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and reduced angiogenesis. Our group has shown that reduced
activity of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2), the most common genetic cause of hereditary and
sporadic PAH, promotes metabolic reprogramming but, given the low penetrance of BMPR2 mutations,
alterations in other genes (i.e., “second hit”) are likely necessary for PAH development. In this proposal, we
will show that carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), a lipolytic enzyme responsible for releasing free fatty acids
from the ER to the mitochondria, is required for FAO and metabolic homeostasis in PMVECs. Our
preliminary studies show that CES1 knockdown in healthy PMVECs results in 1) high glycolysis, 2) reduced
FAO, 3) mitochondrial/ER dysfunction, and 4) oxidative stress. Furthermore, loss of CES1 exacerbates
metabolic reprogramming associated with BMPR2 insufficiency, and restoring CES1 expression improves PAH
PMVEC functional status. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that loss of CES1 in PAH
leads to endothelial dysfunction in PAH through metabolic reprogramming, lipotoxicity, and oxidative
stress. To test this, we propose the following aims: (1): Determine the mechanisms by which loss of CES1
results in metabolic reprogramming and lipotoxicity in PMVECs, (2) Determine whether loss of CES1 promotes
the development and severity of pulmonary hypertension and vasculopathy in mice, and (3) Determine the
contribution of BMPR2 insufficiency and epigenetic repression to reduced CES1 expression in PAH PMVECs.
Using the proposed approach, we will demonstrate that CES1 is essential for properly maintaining and repairing
the pulmonary endothelium and acts as a key modifier of BMPR2 signaling. Given the limited capacity of current
therapies to reverse endothelial dysfunction and prevent small vessel loss, therapeutic interventions that can
restore CES1 expression could serve as a novel treatment approach for PAH."
10999079,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, with age being the
strongest independent non-modifiable risk factor. Calorie restriction (CR), the reduction of total food intake less
than the recommended energy requirement, is the most efficacious dietary intervention to prolong lifespan and
decrease CVD risk. In the largest clinical trial of CR (CALERIETM 2), healthy adults were randomized to either 2
years of CR (n=143) or an ab libitum (AL) (n=75) control group. The CR group achieved ~12% CR over 2 years
and had improvements in cardiometabolic health outcomes such as the change in blood pressure, blood lipids,
and fasting glucose levels from baseline to 2 years. However, preliminary analyses show large interindividual
variability in the magnitude and direction of cardiometabolic health outcomes in response to the CR impacting
intervention efficacy. There was no specific diet prescribed to CR participants in CALERIETM 2, but rather
participants were educated on how to choose their own foods to achieve satiety, mitigate hunger, and to reach
the Dietary Recommended Intakes. Preliminary analysis indeed shows that there was interindividual variability
in the change in diet quality (measured by the Healthy Eating Index) from baseline to 2 years of CR.
Consuming nutrient-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish is beneficial for
cardiometabolic health and are consumed throughout the longest-lived populations. Thus, we hypothesize that
diet quality contributes to the cardiometabolic health outcome variability observed with the 2-year CR
intervention. We will compute novel dietary scores (e.g., Healthy Eating Index and Dietary Inflammatory Index)
from 6-day food records taken at baseline and months 12 and 24 (food records were also taken at months 6
and 18 for the CR group) to measure diet quality. The primary outcome is change in blood pressure, and
secondary outcomes are changes in blood lipids, glucose, insulin, VO2MAX, 10-y CVD risk score, and
biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Then, we will determine whether diet quality scores are
associated with the change in the primary and secondary cardiometabolic health outcomes across each
timepoint. We will also merge untargeted metabolomics data from CALERIETM 2 participants at baseline and
months 12 and 24 with the diet quality scores to identify unique metabolomic cluster signatures for each diet
score. Applying artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, we aim to build prediction models that
will determine the most optimal dietary pattern in the context of CR to improve cardiometabolic health at the
individual level. This project will contribute to the emerging field of precision nutrition research by identifying
factors contributing to outcome variability to dietary interventions. Furthermore, I will learn invaluable skills to
advance my goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher in precision nutrition for healthy aging."

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection that has plagued human health for nearly five centuries.
Over the past 30 years, syphilis cases have skyrocketed, world-wide. Unless the disease-causing agent—
Treponema pallidum—is detected and the patient treated, a multi-system infection occurs which can lead to
death. Current diagnostics are indirect tests that rely on a serological response, which takes weeks to develop.
Furthermore, serology does not report on the status of infection, just exposure. New diagnostics that accurately
detect the syphilis agent, early in disease, would greatly improve patient outcomes by providing immediate
access to effective therapy. The development of new syphilis diagnostic tests has been stalled by several
obstacles, namely the inability to culture T. pallidum in the lab. Recent advances in culture methods have led to
our lab continuously propagating T. pallidum for more than a year and has precipitated several discoveries in
spirochete biology. We have discovered that the bacterium that causes syphilis sheds large amounts of its
peptidoglycan (PG) cell-wall into its environment as it grows. Virtually all bacteria possess PG, but, as it turns
out, the PG of T. pallidum is extremely unique. These findings led us to hypothesize that the detection of shed
T. pallidum PG fragments can act as a biomarker for all stages of the disease, including immediately after
transmission. We have developed a recombinant, monoclonal antibody that is highly specific for released T.
pallidum PG fragments. In this proposal, we will functionalize our monoclonal antibody to covalently attach a
DNA aptamer and use this technology to create an Immuno-PCR diagnostic platform. Using experimental animal
models, along with human patient samples, we will critically test the sensitivity and specificity of our novel system.
If successful, our diagnostic tool will specifically detect infection hours after acquisition and, unlike serological
tests, it will not be impacted by previous exposure. Together, our studies may change the way we diagnose
syphilis."
10978277,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oncogenic stimuli in early cancerous lesions, such as driven by RAS mutations, triggers oncogene-induced
senescence (OIS), which acts as a barrier to prevent malignant transformation. Establishment and
maintenance of OIS is dependent on the sustained DNA damage response (DDR) that stems from aberrant
DNA replication and accumulation of DNA replication stress. Hence, progression to malignancy requires DDR
inactivation and escape from senescence, which, when accompanied by genome instability, accelerates
carcinogenesis. For instance, gains in RAS are prevalent in metastatic prostate cancer, suggesting that this
aberration may be a driver of the prostate cancer progression and aggressiveness. However, the precise
nature of oncogene-induced replication stress and how it affects replication fork integrity remains unclear.
While recent studies have highlighted replication fork reversal as a means to stabilize stressed forks and
promote fork restart, whether oncogenic signaling disrupts fork protection mechanisms, thereby culminating
into fork destabilization remains unclear. Furthermore, whether there exists a distinct program that transmits
upstream oncogenic signaling to a replication fork to cause fork instability is an important outstanding question.
These knowledges are essential for understanding how premalignant lesions restrain from developing cancer,
which would help design therapeutics that sensitizes cells to oncogene-induced replication stress. The goal of
this project is to explicate the mechanism that links oncogene-induced replication stress to DNA replication fork
integrity. We propose that TIMELESS (TIM) in the fork protection complex, an integral constituent of the
replisome, is a key determinant of modulating OIS and transformation. Our preliminary studies reveal that OIS
induced by HRASG12V is accompanied by TIM downregulation in non-transformed cells, which is mediated by
PARP1-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation onto TIM, a novel TIM post-translational modification that primes
TIM for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, TIM is upregulated in OIS-bypassed clones and in the KrasG12D
prostate cancer model, indicating that TIM activity at stalled forks may determine the responses to oncogene-
induced replication stress and resistance to OIS. We thus hypothesize that deprotection of stalled forks via TIM
downregulation is an unappreciated oncogene-induced mechanism that contributes to DNA replication fork
instability to cause OIS. To test this idea in prostate cancer, we will 1) determine how deprotection of stalled
forks is linked to senescence induced by HRASG12V and other oncogenes in cellular models; 2) explicate the
mechanism of TIM downregulation mediated by RAS-PI3K-PARP1 proteolytic signaling; 3) determine the role
of TIM in bypassing senescence and promoting tumorigenesis using KrasG12D-driven prostate cancer organoid
and mouse models. We expect to reveal how modulation of TIM, or stalled fork integrity in general, potentiates
OIS and exerts a selection pressure to bypass OIS for transformation. This knowledge will help develop TIM
gain-of-function as a target to exploit OIS for suppressing tumorigenesis."
10978322,"Title: Development of a smart transformable nanotherapeutic against cancers with acquired resistance to
EGFR-targeted therapies caused by MET amplification
Study Section & Awarding Component Assignment Request: Fogarty International Center
Project summary/Abstract:
 Cancer, a significant public health challenge, is the leading cause of mortality in Thailand and
worldwide. The ongoing rise in cancer cases among Thais, resulting in over a hundred thousand annual
fatalities, has created a compelling necessity and demand for the development of potent pharmaceuticals to
address diverse types of cancer. Unlike conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy minimizes the risk of
side effects by specifically targeting proteins overexpressed or activated in tumors. Among various identified
oncotargets, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represents a particularly appealing one, due to its
overexpression, amplification, and gain of function in several types of cancer. Two classes of EGFR inhibitors
have been clinically approved, including monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Despite a good initial response rate to these drugs, most patients eventually develop drug resistance, mainly
caused by a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) amplification. One promising approach that can
overcome drug resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies caused by MET amplification is co-targeting both
EGFR and MET receptors using a peptide-based nanotherapeutic platform. The specific aims of the proposed
research are (1) To design and synthesize smart transformable EGFR/MET-targeting peptide
nanoparticles (PNPs) and (2) To elucidate the anticancer effects and the underlying mechanisms of the
PNPs on cancers resistant to EGFR-targeted therapies due to MET amplification in vitro and in vivo.
The potential EGFR/MET-targeting peptides will be achieved by the combination between a computer-aided
peptide design strategy and an ultra-high-throughput one-bead one-compound (OBOC) combinatorial library
technology in Dr. Kit S Lam’s laboratory at the University of California, Davis, USA. Dr. Lam is the inventor
of the OBOC technology. Subsequently, the lead EGFR/MET-targeting peptides will be used for the design
and synthesis of smart supramolecular peptides capable of (i) assembling into nanoparticles, (ii) in situ
transformation into nanofibrils upon binding to EGFR/MET at tumor sites, (iii) capturing T effector cells and
facilitating their prolonged retention within the tumor microenvironment, and (iv) releasing the cytotoxic drug
from the nanofibrillar network into cancer cells, maximizing the therapeutic efficacy. At the end of this five-
year project, at least one efficient PNP for treatment of cancer with acquired resistance to EGFR-targeted
therapies due to MET amplification can be obtained, which will be chosen for further clinical studies. The
proposed career development plan will advance not only my research capacity but also essential skills for
manuscript writing, NIH grant writing, and leadership, culminating in publication of high-quality research
articles, submission of R01 grant proposal, professional networking, academic promotion, and development
into a successful, independent researcher."
10978324,"Bacterial cells with the same genetic material can have different transcriptional states. These distinct
transcriptional states are crucial to many important physiological functions, such as sporulation, motility,
metabolic adaptation, antibiotic resistance, and biofilm formation. To identify the distinct transcriptional cell states
that are present in a population of bacteria, we need to measure the expression levels of all genes in individual
bacterial cells across a large number of cells. To do so, we have recently developed a method, called proBac-
seq, which extends the power of commercial microfluidic platforms for single-cell RNA sequencing of mammalian
cells to bacterial cells. Our method uses DNA probes with poly-A tails to tag individual transcripts in fixed bacteria.
The tagged bacteria are then processed with a commercial platform for single-cell RNA sequencing (such as
10X) where the DNA probes are captured and quantified as if they were transcripts of a mammalian cell. In proof-
of-principle experiments, we have applied our method to E. coli, Bacillus, and C. perfringens, identifying known
and new transcriptional cell states. Here, we propose to extend proBac-seq to enable profiling of hundreds of
thousands of individual bacterial cells in a single run and apply it to create an atlas of transcriptional cell states
of Salmonella enterica during infection. Salmonella is an important human pathogen and a major cause of
foodborne illnesses. Intriguingly, pathogenic strains of Salmonella often exist asymptomatically in people. In
addition, Salmonella can infect a wide variety of cell types, colonize different niches, and interact with the immune
cells and gut microbiome. Therefore, to understand pathogenicity of Salmonella and devise effective therapies,
we need to identify what cell states are present during infection, how cells transition between these states, and
at what rates. To answer this question, we will develop a high through-put platform for cost-effective single-cell
RNA sequencing of bacteria (Aim 1). We will incorporate multiplexing into proBac-seq to increase cell numbers,
implement protein readout using DNA-tagged antibodies, and develop a method for enriching for a particular
species of bacteria from a mixture of species prior to single-cell profiling. Critically, we will build the computational
frameworks needed for data analysis. Our platform will be broadly useful. We will therefore openly share
reagents, protocols, and computational pipelines. In Aim 2, we will apply our platform to create an atlas of
transcriptional cell states of Salmonella during infection in culture and using an in vitro model of intestinal
organoids. We will infer how distinct cell states interact with each other, how they are regulated, and the dynamics
of transitions between them. We will identify perturbations that disrupt the virulent cell state or hinder transitions
into that state. In Aim 3, we will validate our findings in an in vivo model of infection using gnotobiotic mice. We
will also measure the interactions between the gut microbiome and cell states of Salmonella using gnotobiotic
mice colonized with naturally acquired microbiota. Our findings can potentially transform our understanding of
pathogenicity of Salmonella. The tools developed here can be broadly applied to other bacterial systems."
10978877,"Project Summary: Our long-term objective is to define the epigenetic mechanisms that ensure accurate genome
maintenance, and to exploit these findings to improve human health. Singe-stranded DNA lesions (SSLs) are
among the most abundant genomic aberrations and are the primary source of Poly-(ADP-ribose) Polymerase
(PARP) activation, which orchestrates downstream repair events. In somatic cells, aberrant SSL repair promotes
mutagenic events that are relevant to tumorigenesis. In cancer, SSL-inducing agents, including topoisomerase
1 inhibitors (TOP1i) and alkylating drugs, are mainstay therapies, which can be potentiated in the presence of
PARP inhibitors. SSL repair is thus fundamentally important not only for normal genome maintenance but also
as a potential cancer vulnerability.
In this proposal, we will investigate the epigenetic control of SSL repair, a feature that remains poorly understood
to date. In recent unpublished work, we have identified macroH2A1, an abundant histone H2A variant in
mammalian chromatin, as an effector of this process. MacroH2A1 exists as two alternative splice isoforms,
macroH2A1.1 and macroH2A1.2, and aberrant macroH2A1 splicing is a shared albeit poorly understood feature
of many cancers. MacroH2A1.1, but not the other isoform, binds poly-(ADP-ribose) derivatives, and our
preliminary data point to a macroH2A1.1-specific role in SSL removal. We further find that macroH2A1.1 levels
are inversely correlated with sensitivity to SSL-inducing agents in cancer cell lines. We hypothesize that changes
in SSL repair proficiency due to altered macroH2A1 splicing have a direct impact on mutation burden, tumor
development and cancer treatment response. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of alternatively spliced
macroH2A1 isoforms in SSL repair, identify specific repair effectors and assess the role of the damage-proximal
chromatin environment on repair kinetics using innovative cell-based reporters. We will then investigate how
macroH2A1 isoform manipulation affects cancer cell sensitivity to SSL-inducing agents. Aim 2 will determine the
impact of macroH2A1 on genome integrity specifically in the context of TOP1-related lesions, which result in
increased mutation burden that is relevant to human cancer. What protects the genome from excessive TOP1
activity remains unknown. We hypothesize that macroH2A1 isoforms control TOP1-associated DNA damage
and mutagenesis. We will test these predictions using genomic approaches and cell-based models. Aim 3 will
establish a proof of principle for macroH2A1 function in cancer in the context of impaired SSL repair. First, we
will determine the dependency of TOP1-associated tumorigenesis on macroH2A1.1 in a mouse model. Then,
we will test whether macroH2A1 splicing imbalance in human tumor organoids predicts sensitivity to SSL-
inducing drugs and PARP inhibitors. Collectively, these studies promise to transform current models of SSL
repair and advance our understanding of the epigenetic pathways that control mutation burden and SSL
sensitivity in cancer."
10978887,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) has been established as an effective, safe, and feasible first-line
option in lung cancer. The quest for dose escalation to increase tumor control and survival benefit, and
simultaneously to minimize normal tissue complication, requires precise radiation delivery to a region including
the cancerous target and the smallest possible ring region around the target (called margin) to ensure sufficient
dose to the target in the presence of positioning uncertainty, mainly caused by respiratory motion. This is
especially critical for SBRT, as it is vulnerable to geometry errors due to high dose per fraction, a steep dose
gradient, and the long delivery time that increases chances of changes in motion. Pre-treatment imaging
technologies have been used to aid the position of tumor against the treatment beam. Yet, a margin size of 6-
10 mm is still routinely used to accommodate systematic and random changes in respiratory motion
magnitude, baseline, and period. Consequently, high dose (close to prescription level) is delivered to a large
volume of normal tissue, yielding toxicity concern. There is a strong, but unmet need for margin reduction in
lung SBRT. The ultimate form of margin reduction is 4D radiotherapy (RT) that modifies multi-leaf collimator
positions in real time in response to tumor motion to always direct radiation to the tumor. Knowing tumor
position in real time is the prerequisite for 4D RT. Nonetheless, to date, no approach can provide accurate and
reliable 3D tumor tracking. To address this problem, our group proposed in 2016 a tumor tracking scheme by
measuring scattered x-ray photons and lately demonstrated its potential feasibility using state-of-the-art photon
counting detection technology. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop and translate a prototype system
with appropriate capability for 3D tumor tracking, to evaluate its performance in phantom and patient studies,
and to demonstrate its clinical impacts, by jointing the strong and complementary expertise of teams at Johns
Hopkins University, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Varex Imaging. We will pursue four specific aims
(SAs). SA1. Develop a prototype hardware system to image tumor region with scattered kV photons. SA2.
Develop a software system for data processing pipeline and tumor tracking. SA3. Integrate the developed
systems to form a prototype and perform phantom experiments to characterize its performance. SA4.
Implement the system in clinic, perform patient studies to demonstrate feasibility and advantages of real-time
3D tumor tracking, and translate it to end users. The innovation of this project is a novel system measuring
scattered kV x-ray photons to image tumor regions and using it to track tumor motion. Deliverability is ensured
by preliminary studies and the team with complementary expertise. Our project will overcome a major hurdle in
4D RT, enabling margin reduction in lung cancer SBRT and hence generate substantial clinical impacts.
Although focusing on lung cancer SBRT, the technology is expected to be translatable to many other tumor
sites facing the same need for real-time tumor tracking."
10999885,"ABSTRACT
Economic choice behavior is specifically disrupted in neurological and mental disorders such as frontotemporal
dementia, major depression, and drug addiction. To shed light on these diseases and to pave the way for
treatments, it is critical to understand the neural underpinnings of this behavior. The past 20 years witnessed
considerable progress. Economic choices are thought to involve two mental stages – subjective values are
assigned to the available options and a decision is made by comparing values. Clinical data, lesion studies,
functional imaging, and neurophysiology link these mental operations to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In
particular, previous work in my lab examined neuronal activity in the OFC of monkeys choosing between
different juice flavors. We identified different groups of neurons encoding individual offer values, the binary
choice outcome, and the chosen value. These variables capture both the input (offer value) and the output
(chosen juice, chosen value) of the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups identified in OFC constitute
the building blocks of a decision circuit. A series of empirical and computational results support this proposal.
Importantly, current notions come primarily from experiments where subjects made simple binary choices,
similar to that between steak and salmon a person might make when dining in a restaurant. However, real life
decisions are often more complex. For example, in many circumstances, options are defined not by a single
good (e.g., steak vs. salmon) but rather by a good bundle (e.g., steak and potatoes vs. salmon and rice).
Furthermore, most restaurants offer many dishes – not just two. That is, choices often involve more than two
options. Last but not least, choices depend on the internal state of the subject, which can vary. Thus, the same
person dining in the same restaurant might choose different dishes on different nights. The overarching goal of
this proposal is to assess how the decision circuit adapts or reconfigures itself to generate choices in different
behavioral conditions. Neuronal recordings will focus on OFC. In Aim 1, we will examine choices between
bundles. Each bundle will be constituted of 2 juice types (A+B vs. C+D design) that, if chosen, will be delivered
sequentially. In Aim 2, we will examine choices between three options varying on three dimensions (juice type,
quantity, probability). We will alternate binary and trinary choices and examine differences in neuronal activity.
In Aim 3, we will assess how changes in the internal state of the subject shape decisions. We will examine
choices under risk, where the internal state is defined by 3 parameters. Theoretical considerations suggest that
changes in the relative value of the juices reflect changes in circuit connectivity. To test this and other
predictions, we will record from large populations of neurons simultaneously, and we will use network inference
analysis to estimate the effective connectivity of the circuit. Independent of the outcome of the experiments,
fulfilling these Aims will significantly advance our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying
economic decisions. Our historic record and robust preliminary results indicate high likelihood of success."
10986289,"Pediatric subglottic stenosis (SGS) is a pathological narrowing of the airway, affecting up to 2% of infants. The
restriction of the airway requires a dramatic increase in breathing effort, and can result in reliance on
tracheostomy tubes, respiratory failure, and death if left untreated. Multiple treatment options presently exist for
SGS, and they range from conservative approaches (eg: observation) to invasive open airway reconstructive
surgeries. A patient's long-term trajectory depends on proper classification of disease severity and selection of
the optimal treatment modality. Diagnosis and treatment planning is currently performed via endoscopy and a
low-fidelity, four-tiered grading system, the Cotton-Meyer scale, which is derived from endotracheal tube sizing.
Cross-sectional imaging is not standard of care for this population and thus no accurate quantitative measures
of the obstruction size and location are available for diagnosis. Additionally, the current diagnostic workup does
not quantify respiratory effort, and there is limited information describing the relationship between obstruction
size and respiratory physiology (eg: breathing resistance). Clinicians are forced to risk-stratify patients and
select a treatment course based on an incomplete and imprecise descriptions of SGS severity. The
management of SGS patients, thus, remains a challenging and drawn-out process with patients often requiring
multiple treatments. We aim to improve the clinical care of this sensitive population by developing a novel
diagnostic pipeline that accurately quantifies stenosis morphology and a patient's respiratory effort. This
pipeline leverages a computer-vision algorithm, structure from motion (SfM), and computational fluid dynamic
(CFD) simulations to generate 3D reconstructions of the diseased airway and then compute the airflow
environment. Crucially, the SfM algorithm reconstructs the 3D airway anatomy directly from standard clinical
endoscopy and requires almost no modification to the current diagnostic protocol. In Aim 1 we will demonstrate
and validate our SfM+CFD analysis pipeline on a cohort of patients receiving both endoscopy and computed
tomography (CT) imaging of the airway; the CT images provide a validation dataset for surfaces derived from
endoscopy using SfM. In Aim 2 we will develop the relationship between parameters measured from our
pipeline (eg: stenosis size, breathing resistance) and clinical severity. Upon completion of this study, we will
have refined and validated our analysis pipeline and identified the metrics that best predict clinical severity in a
small cohort and will be well positioned for a prospective clinical validation study. As our method relies on
standard endoscopy and not cross-sectional imaging, it can be applied across the full spectrum of SGS
patients and be used to study patients longitudinally throughout their treatment course. The rich patient-specific
data-set will enable improved risk-stratification, the identification of predictive factors for surgery, investigation
into treatment failure mechanisms, and improve our understanding of SGS disease progression and the role of
various treatments within the therapeutic ladder."
10987601,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a localized cancer immunotherapy using particle-anchored
cytokines with prolonged intratumoral retention to elicit durable anti-tumor immune responses. It is well known
that immunostimulatory cytokines can elicit robust anti-tumor immune responses in preclinical studies but also
exhibit severe immune-related adverse events due to systemic exposures. The current drug delivery
methodology cannot sustainably supply cytokines for days to weeks, failing to fully address issues of toxicity and
limited efficacy. We hypothesize that anchoring cytokines to large-sized particles for intratumoral injection would
enhance the local retention of cytokines (e.g., IL-12 and IL-15) to drive tumor inhibition while avoiding the
systemic exposures of such cytokines that cause adverse effects. To test this hypothesis, we develop a novel
local delivery system that physically anchors the Fc-cytokine to particles having surface-decorated Fc-binding
peptides. Our preliminary studies show that the intratumoral administration of our new particle-anchored cytokine
significantly increases tumor retention of cytokines and markedly reduces systemic toxicity. Moreover, local
treatments of our micron-meter-sized particle-anchored cytokines promote cures in poorly immunogenic tumor
models, and elicit anti-tumor immunities with controls over distant untreated lesions. Overall, two specific aims
will be pursued in this proposal, including: (i) to develop liposome-anchored cytokines with prolonged tumor
retention over one week and minimal systemic leakage of free cytokines; and (ii) to elucidate the mechanisms
by which particle-anchored cytokines elicit durable anti-tumor immunity to improve efficacies in poorly
immunogenic tumors. Our simple formulation technology would fully address the dose-limiting toxicity problem
in the use of cytokines in cancer immunotherapy, and provide a new and effective treatment option for difficult-
to-treat solid tumors when combined with other immunotherapeutics. This work will also advance the research
on drug delivery technology by elucidating crucial physicochemical characteristics to circumvent systemic
leakage for local drug delivery. This work will also significantly advance our understanding of how localized
immunostimulatory cytokines impact tumor microenvironments, leading to enhanced systemic anti-tumor
immunity and better treatment outcomes."
10988035,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application is a request for funding of a vaccine immunogenetics research program focused on identifying
critical genetic and phenotypic determinants of COVID-19 infection and/or vaccination-induced immunity by
examining associations between gene polymorphisms, HLA allelic variation, and clinical phenotypes and inter-
individual variations in immune response to COVID-19. Our laboratory has done significant work delineating
the effect of gene polymorphisms on mumps, measles, rubella, influenza, and smallpox vaccine immune
responses. Our research demonstrates that variations in immune responses to viral vaccines are multigenic
and not a single dominant allele model and that the genetic contribution to such variations in immune
responses can be quantified. Informed by insights from these studies and given the public health importance of
the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we now turn our attention to understanding genetic associations with
COVID-19-induced immune responses (regardless of whether they are vaccine or infection-induced, or a result
of hybrid immunity). The most thorough and efficient study for such purposes is a comprehensive
discovery/replication genome-wide association study (GWAS), to which we will add a phenome association
study (PheWAS) followed by a more complete characterization of distinct immune effector mechanisms
believed to contribute to protective immunity. Our studies will identify gene polymorphisms and pathways
having the largest or most critical impact on inter-individual variations in immunity among subjects, and how
comorbidities (phenotypes) contribute to these variations. Our Specific Aims are to 1) perform a large,
genome-wide association study to identify novel genetic associations between SNPs and HLA alleles and
inter-individual variations in the humoral immune response to COVID-19 infection or vaccination; identify
polygenic risk scores predictive of antibody response; replicate the findings in an independent cohort; evaluate
significant findings in a cohort with documented infection and no vaccination; 2) conduct a phenome-wide
association study to quantify the effect of additional subject characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity,
BMI), comorbidities, and phecodes (clusters of ICD10 codes) on the antibody response to COVID-19 vaccines;
and 3) Evaluate the effect of genetic variation and host factors on T cell and B cell markers of immune
response following vaccination. These aims will allow us to comprehensively define how inter-individual
variations in immune responses to COVID-19 vaccine are influenced by gene polymorphisms and host
characteristics. Notably, despite the public health implications, there are no population-based studies
identifying associations between COVID-19 vaccine immune response and genome-wide SNPs or clinical
phenotypes. Our study is carefully designed to be rigorous and produce robust, unbiased, and reproducible
results applicable to the US population."
10989868,"Background: One in four Veterans presenting to VA primary care screen positive for hazardous drinking.
However, due to barriers such as Veterans’ stigma about seeking alcohol use treatment and challenges with
traveling to VA, most of these Veterans do not receive any alcohol-related care. Mobile applications (apps) are
an innovative means of expanding access to alcohol use treatment. The evidence for mobile apps, such as
“Step Away”, to improve drinking outcomes is emerging. Nevertheless, poor patient engagement remains the
Achilles’ heel of these apps. Peer Specialists (“Peers”) can facilitate Veterans’ engagement with mobile apps
intended for self-management of hazardous drinking by helping to orient patients to these apps and by
providing technical support and accountability. In a VA HSR&D pilot study (PPO 16-305), we created a Veteran
version of the Step Away app (“Stand Down: Think Before You Drink”) and conducted an open trial in which
Veterans with hazardous drinking used the app while receiving Peer phone support. The intervention (“Peer-
Supported [PS]-Stand Down”) was highly acceptable to patients, and patients reported significant
improvements in drinking outcomes. These data provide a strong foundation for a larger pragmatic trial to test
the effectiveness of the Stand Down app and PS-Stand Down to reduce hazardous drinking among Veterans
seen in primary care, relative to the current standard of care that these patients receive.
Significance: By capitalizing on a high-value workforce shown to improve Veterans engagement in care (i.e.,
Peers), this research can expand access to alcohol care for Veterans with low staff burden and, in turn, reduce
the long-term health consequences associated with untreated hazardous drinking. Our proposed research
responds to HSR&D priorities of Access to Care, Mental Health, and Virtual Care, and the VA MISSION Act.
Innovation and Impact: Poor patient engagement severely limits the potential effectiveness of mobile apps for
self-management of alcohol use problems. Use of Peers to enhance patients’ engagement with such apps is a
novel approach to overcoming this problem. Peers are ideally suited to this role by virtue of their lived
experience with addiction. This approach represents a novel application of the supportive accountability model
of adherence to e-health interventions. Combined with VA’s expansion of Peers on Patient Aligned Care
Teams (PACT), PS-Stand Down, if shown to be effective, can transform the delivery of care for Veterans in
primary care who screen positive for hazardous drinking.
Specific Aims: We propose to evaluate whether the Stand Down app reduces drinking among Veteran
primary care patients who engage in hazardous drinking, and for whom PS-Stand Down is more effective than
the app alone. Aim 1: Test whether Stand Down (vs. Usual Care; UC) and PS-Stand Down (vs. UC and vs.
app only) predicts better drinking outcomes, and test mediators of these effects. Aim 2: Test for differences in
satisfaction with care across conditions, and conduct qualitative interviews with patients and PACT staff to
understand potential barriers/facilitators to implementing PS-Stand Down in primary care. Aim 3: Explore
baseline moderators to elucidate for whom PS-Stand Down (vs. app only) is most beneficial.
Methodology: In a 3-group RCT at the Palo Alto and Syracuse VAs, 274 Veteran primary patients who screen
positive for hazardous drinking, received a brief intervention following a positive screen, and are not currently
in alcohol use treatment will complete a baseline interview, be randomized to either (i) UC, (ii) UC plus Stand
Down, or (iii) UC plus PS-Stand Down (four phone sessions with a Peer over 8 weeks to enhance app
engagement), and be re-interviewed at 8, 20, and 32 weeks. For Aim 2, the CFIR framework will guide key
informant interviews with 12 patients and 12 PACT providers from each site.
Next Steps/Implementation: Depending on the results, we will work with our VACO partners in the Offices of
Mental Health & Suicide Prevention and Connected Care to conduct a large multisite implementation trial."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by the intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), infects one-fourth
of the world’s population. Majority of the infected individuals are latently infected (LTBI), of which 5-10% stand
a risk of progressing to active TB disease (ATB) during their lifetime. There is limited knowledge about the
precise mechanisms and pathways that mediate protective versus pathologic immunity during TB. Using RNA-
sequencing analysis, we recently identified novel immune pathways upregulated during TB latency across
species, namely Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway. The BMP signaling pathway plays a
prominent role in the regulation of lung development and adult lung homeostasis, and tissue repair following
injury. However, the role of lung tissue repair and regeneration during TB latency is unexplored, and the
specific role of the protective BMP-pathway in latent Mtb infection remains unknown. Moreover, our data
suggests that lung tissue damage is being actively repaired in controllers during TB latency, without triggering
a substantial inflammatory response. Therefore, we hypothesize that during TB latency, BMP signaling is
upregulated mediating lung tissue repair, regeneration and Mtb control. This hypothesis will be
addressed in the following two Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the functional role of the
BMP- pathway in Mtb control and TB reactivation. In Specific Aim 2, we will characterize the cellular
mechanisms of BMP-pathway activation during TB latency. These studies can then pave the way for new
strategies that will aid in the development of therapeutic interventions which can deter the progression from TB
latency to TB disease."

In 2021, there was an estimated 29.5 million people that were diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD),
resulting in an estimated annual cost of $249 billion to the US economy. AUD is an ongoing, severe health
crisis that requires further research to identify therapeutic targets. Stress can drive initial and sustained drug
use, as well as trigger relapse during abstinence, however the mechanisms that drive this effect are under
active research. The insula is a highly interconnected brain region that has been implicated in multiple
disorders, including AUD. Interestingly, fMRI studies have shown that alcohol-dependent individuals have
reduced insular cortex volumes, which was correlated with self-reports of impulsivity. PTSD patients have
increased connectivity between the insula and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), suggesting this
pathway is recruited by salient negative affective states. We have shown that the insula-BNST pathway drives
negative affect-like behavior during abstinence, however the molecular mechanisms involved in this pathway
are not understood. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been repeatedly shown to play an
important role in reward and stress involved with drug misuse, however further research is needed to
understand circuit specific nAChRs in these behaviors. Ethanol (EtOH) acts on nAChRs in a subunit specific
manner. Multiple nAChR subunits have been implicated in AUD, one of the most prominent being α4β2, which
are highly expressed throughout the brain. Moreover, multiple compounds acting on α4β2 nAChRs reduced
binge-like EtOH consumption. Chronic alcohol exposure in rhesus monkeys resulted in decreased α4β2
nAChRs in the insular cortex, suggesting a role for these receptors in driving AUD associated behaviors. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize the role of α4β2 nAChRs expressed in mid-insulaBNST
neurons in modulating compulsive-like EtOH consumption and abstinence-induced negative affect-like
behavior. We will use whole-cell electrophysiology and calcium imaging in Aim 1 to determine the changes in
sensitivity to α4β2 nAChRs expressed in insula-BNST neurons following binge-like EtOH drinking, aversion-
resistant drinking and abstinence from alcohol. In aim 2, we will use bidirectional genetic manipulation of β2
nAChRs in this specific cell population to determine whether these receptors are sufficient and necessary for
binge-like drinking and abstinence-induced negative affect. These studies will highlight the potential for
nAChRs expressed in the insula-BNST pathway as a potential therapeutic target for AUD."
10998762,"ABSTRACT
Enzymes do not drift aimlessly within a cytoplasmic soup. Rather cell regulatory events occur within the confines
of highly organized intracellular signaling nanodomains. Protein kinase compartmentalization enhances the
fidelity of signal transduction and permits the parallel processing of chemical signals within the same cell. Our
lab discovered and defined A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs), a prototypic class of signal organizing
proteins. The physiological significance of this mechanism is validated in several diseases. This proposal
explores new PKAc mutants that locally drive cortisol secretion in adrenal Cushing’s syndrome. This is an
endocrine disorder where adrenal cells release excess stress hormone cortisol. This disease afflicts about fifteen
per million people annually and is 3-5 times more prevalent in women than men. Symptoms include adrenal
hyperplasia, midsection weight gain and comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and psychiatric
disorders. Adrenal (also called non-ACTH) Cushing’s is driven by somatic mutations in the catalytic subunit of
protein kinase A (PKAc). Most mutations occur within regions of PKAc that bind regulatory subunits. This protein-
protein interaction is not only necessary for autoinhibition of kinase activity but directs compartmentalization of
PKA holoenzymes through association with AKAPs. The most prevalent mutant PKAc-L205R is found in ~45%
of Cushing’s patients. Other PKAc mutations occur at frequencies of less than 1%. Using an innovative
personalized medicine workflow to screen clinical samples we have discovered a new PKAc-W196G variant in
~20% of adrenal Cushing's patients. This single amino acid change promotes structural perturbations in PKAc.
Preliminary analyses of patient tissues harboring PKAcW196G detect elevated levels of type I regulatory subunit
(RIa). Proximity proteomic screening of adrenal cell lines reveals that PKAcW196G interfaces with RI, dual-function
AKAPs, and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. StAR is a PKA substrate that controls the rate-limiting
step in cortisol biosynthesis. CRISPR/Cas knockout of dual-function AKAP220 in adrenal cells attenuates stress
hormone release. This exciting new data has forged an experimental plan of two specific aims.
AIM 1: EVALUATES THE MUTATIONAL FREQUENCY AND IMPACT OF PKACW196G? Genetic, biochemical, and cellular
approaches will monitor a) mutational frequencies of PKAcW196G and its localization in patient tissues, b) the
physiochemical and activity profile of PKAcW196G and c) how this Cushing's kinase alters endocrine responses.
AIM 2: TESTS IF ANCHORED TYPE I PKA SIGNALING PREDOMINATES IN ADRENAL CUSHING’S SYNDROME? PKAcW196G
and the less common PKAcW196R analog are incorporated into AKAP220 signaling islands via association with
RIa. Whole animal physiology studies and a novel precision pharmacology strategy will establish if a) PKAcW196G
(& W196R) signal through AKAP220 and if b) organellar targeting enhances the efficacy of PKA drugs to reduce
hypersecretion or biosynthesis of stress hormone."
10997678,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with hematologic cancer are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality from severe lung infections due
to both disease and treatment-associated defects in cell-mediated and humoral immunity. CD8 T cell immunity
is critical for survival from these infections, as evidenced by our laboratory’s findings in patients with hematologic
cancer and severe COVID-19 infection. However, persistent antigen exposure during severe infections leads to
loss of T-cell cytotoxic effector function and proliferative capacity, leading to inefficient pathogen clearance.
Therefore, strategies to reverse CD8 T cell dysfunction represent a critical unmet need in patients with
hematologic cancer and severe lung infections. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that mitochondrial redox
stress drives CD8+ T-cell dysfunction during persistent antigen exposure in a manner that can be reversed by
the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac) and recently completed a clinical trial of N-Ac in cancer patients with
severe COVID-19 infection. In my preliminary studies, I found that circulating CD8 T cells from patients with
cancer and severe COVID-19 had significantly reduced expression of Pellino-1 (PELI1) following N-Ac treatment.
PELI1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase known to negatively regulate CD8 T-cell activation. However, its role in limiting
CD8 T-cell function during severe infections remains unknown.
Therefore, my hypothesis is PELI1 is a redox-sensitive E3 ligase that limits CD8 T cell immunity during severe
respiratory infections by selectively degrading substrates essential for self-renewal and cytotoxicity. We will
address this hypothesis through the following Specific Aims. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that PELI1 limits
CD8+ T cell immunity during severe respiratory infections in vivo, by analyzing primary samples from
hematologic cancer patients with a variety of respiratory infections as well as by determining the impact of PELI1
knockout on T-cell mediated pathogen clearance in mouse models of severe pneumonia. In Aim 2, I will
determine the mechanism by which PELI-1 restricts CD8+ T-cell function during persistent antigen exposure. By
performing biochemical and proteomic analyses to identify both PELI1 substrates and redox-dependent post-
translational modifications in PELI-1 to gain insight into mechanisms of PELI1 function and regulation. The
information obtained from this project will lay the groundwork for understanding of how redox regulation impacts
T-cell dysfunction, thereby paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies for patients with severe
respiratory infections, including those with concurrent hematologic cancers."

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) present a complex array of neurodevelopmental challenges, affecting
approximately 1 in 100 individuals globally. Despite substantial efforts to understand the genetic underpinnings
of ASD, therapeutic treatments remain elusive. Transcription factor 4 (TCF4) loss-of-function (LOF) mutations
are implicated in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (PTHS), a syndromic form of ASD. While PTHS pathophysiology has
been extensively studied in murine models, understanding TCF4 function within a human context is imperative.
This proposal aims to utilize patient-derived induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs) to model synaptic transmission,
focusing on presynaptic regulatory roles of TCF4 and the therapeutic potential of RIMBP2 re-expression.
Our recently published data indicate significant deficits in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents
(sEPSCs) and network activity in PTHS hiPSC-derived neurons, potentially stemming from presynaptic
abnormalities. From our differential expression gene analysis, RIMBP2, a presynaptic organizer, emerged as
the most significantly downregulated gene, with its re-expression rescuing deficits in network synchronicity and
sEPSC frequency. In this study, I will explore the impact of TCF4 LOF on presynaptic release, subcellular
protein localization, and ultrastructure, along with mechanism by which RIMBP2 rescues deficits. In aim
1, I will employ live-cell imaging with the glutamate sensor iGluSnFR3 to quantify presynaptic release deficits
and changes in evoked neurotransmitter release, release probability, and coupling distance between release
ready vesicles and calcium channels. Additionally, with time-resolved electron microscopy, I will examine deficits
in synaptic ultrastructure. In aim 2, I will characterize deficits involving calcium channel conductance, expression,
and localization. First, I will measure presynaptic calcium influx with the calcium sensor SynG-Camp6f. Then,
using quantitative microscopy, I will assess the expression and localization of calcium channels along with
related proteins in the active zone. Finally, I will employ live-gold-labeling electron microscopy to measure the
coupling distance between calcium channels and docked vesicles at the nanometer scale.
The significance of this research lies in elucidating the synaptic deficits associated with TCF4 LOF, providing a
foundation for targeted therapeutics. The anticipated results could identify candidate genes and inform novel
approaches to restore presynaptic release deficits linked to TCF4 dysfunction in PTHS. The study's innovative
methodology, incorporating advanced imaging techniques and human-derived models, contributes a unique
perspective to understanding the synaptic architecture of neurons affected by TCF4 mutations. With the support
of my proposed mentorship team and the outstanding training environment, the research and training activities
proposed here will ideally position me for a future career in academic neuroscience research."

Hepatic lipid synthesis and catabolism is tightly regulated. Altered lipogenesis, lipid utilization, and lipoprotein
secretion in liver can adversely affect local and systemic lipid homeostasis. While the critical role of insulin in
promoting hepatic lipid and lipoprotein synthesis is widely studied, major knowledge gaps exist regarding
hormones that suppress hepatic lipogenesis and promote fat oxidation. Since our initial discovery of the
CTRP family of secreted hormones, we have systematically characterized the metabolic function and
mechanisms of action of each CTRP using gain- and loss-of-function mouse models. In this competitive
renewal application, we propose focused studies of CTRP1, based on our recent discovery that this hormone
plays a critical role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism. Adipose and liver are the two major tissues that
express CTRP1. Even on a control low-fat diet (LFD), aged CTRP1 knockout (KO) mice have strikingly
enlarged liver, pronounced hepatic steatosis, and fibrosis. When obesity is induced with a high-fat diet
(HFD), Ctrp1-KO mice develop a significantly more severe non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and this
is associated with a deficit in mitochondrial β-oxidation. When challenged with a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH)-provoking diet, Ctrp1-KO mice have markedly more severe phenotypes. In contrast to the loss-of-
function phenotypes, overexpression of CTRP1 in primary mouse hepatocytes suppresses lipid synthesis
and promotes fat oxidation and mitochondrial respiration. Collectively, these data indicate that liver is a major
target tissue of CTRP1; disrupting CTRP1-regulated pathways in liver affects hepatic lipid metabolism,
inflammation, and fibrosis. We propose two specific aims toward understanding the contribution of CTRP1 to
hepatic lipid metabolism (Aim 1) and the protective mechanisms of CTRP1 in mitigating the severity of fatty
liver, inflammation, and fibrosis in the context of NASH (Aim 2). The completion of these aims will provide
major advancement and critical insights into novel pathways regulating hepatic lipid metabolism by the
secreted hormone, CTRP1. This knowledge may inform innovative strategies to mitigate NAFLD and NASH
in clinical settings."

The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) is sustainable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be further extended by increasing its accessibility to a broader participant population. This application would support the Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) UDN Diagnostic Center of Excellence (DCoE). WashU and BJC Healthcare together represent a large academic medical center, hospital, and outpatient clinical system that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in finding diagnoses for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WashU promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, we propose to continue to advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by utilizing a system for clinical and genomic review of applications and participant cases, with expanded, expert clinical, laboratory, and informatics expertise to solve cases that are and are not suspected to have genetic underpinnings. Specific strengths of our DCoE include neurological disorders (neurodevelopmental, neuromuscular), inborn errors of immunity, inherited pulmonary disorders, and disorders caused by somatic mosaicism. Second, we aim to improve equity and access to the UDN for participants from underserved populations. In particular, we will focus our outreach program for underrepresented minority populations and populations with lower socioeconomic status through a Community Engagement Strategy that includes establishment of a collaboration with healthcare organization supporting federally-qualified health centers and the Saint Louis County Health Department, with appointment of a new Equity Officer. Third, we will implement a Sustainability Strategy including research support, insurance billing, charitable funds, and departmental cost-sharing. We will work closely with the UDN Network and the Data Management and Coordinating Center to implement collaborative, highly effective, equitable, and sustainable methods for undiagnosed patients."
10995887,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanistic link between fetal glucagon and placental
nutrient delivery as a novel, adaptive mechanism for matching nutrient supply to fetal metabolic
demand under adverse uterine conditions. Pregnancies complicated by intrauterine acidosis, hypoxia,
and growth restriction are often characterized by elevated fetal glucagon. While fetal metabolic
hormones have historically been considered for their function in regulating fetal growth, recent
evidence from the Rozance laboratory has suggested glucagon may be regulating maternal nutrient
delivery via placental signaling. In nine-day fetal glucagon infusions in sheep, we observed
dramatically reduced uterine blood flow which resulted in decreased placental transfer of amino acids,
glucose, and oxygen to the fetus. This decrease was accompanied by a robust reduction in maternal
placental lactogen (CSH) concentrations, which we have previously demonstrated results in lower
uterine blood flow and placental nutrient delivery in an in vivo model of placental CSH RNAi in sheep.
Thus, we hypothesize that fetal glucagon regulates placental nutrient delivery by inhibiting placental
trophoblast CSH secretion and uterine blood flow. This proposal will demonstrate that fetal glucagon
acts by matching placental nutrient delivery to fetal growth and metabolic demands by regulating
maternal CSH secretion and NO-mediated vasodilation to alter blood flow. Aim 1 will establish the
mechanism by which fetal glucagon inhibits CSH secretion by the trophoblast. Aim 2 will identify the
link between fetal glucagon, CSH, and uterine blood flow, and how this relationship regulates
vasoactivity and placental nutrient delivery. Expected outcomes: This proposal will be the first
mechanistic physiological investigation into fetal glucagon as an inhibitor of trophoblast CSH
production, regulating uterine blood flow and placental nutrient transfer. Furthermore, it will also
demonstrate the novel vasodilatory role of CSH in uterine circulation. Lastly, this proposal will provide
me critical training in fetal physiology, improve the translatability of my research by working with
human samples, augment my grantsmanship and scientific writing skills, and cultivate key
professional relationships to establish successful future collaborations as a tenure-track, assistant
professor specializing in fetal-placental-maternal communication. Impact: The research outlined by
this proposal will identify a previously unknown mechanism for matching nutrient delivery to fetal
metabolic demand to increase survival during pregnancy complications."

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic disorder characterized clinically by recurring
episodes of pelvic pain and increased urination frequency, significantly impairing patients' quality of life. Irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, as
well as other somatic, visceral, and psychiatric comorbidities. Despite distinct origins, recent studies have shown
a strong overlap between both syndromes and this pathological co-occurrence is believed to be responsible for
the comorbidity of a number of lower urinary tract and colonic disorders, including, but not limited to, IBS,
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), overactive bladder (OAB), and IC/BPS. There is an unmet medical need in
terms of effective diagnostics and treatment. One of the challenges is a lack of understanding of the molecular
and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of neurogenic bladder pain. Moreover, how bladder
inflammation promotes colon sensitization is poorly understood.
Pilot studies showed that MrgprB2 is required for bladder pain and sensitization of colon to mechanical
stimulation induced by intravesical instillation of LL-37. These observations led us to frame the hypothesis that
MrgprB2+ mast cell (MC)-TRPV1+ nociceptor clusters mediate bladder pain and inter-organ sensitization
between the bladder and colon. In this grant proposal we will: 1) Use chemogenetic inhibition of mast cells and
virally mediated ablation of TRPV1+ bladder-innervating nociceptors to investigate in vivo functions of the
MrgprB2+ MC-TRPV1+ nociceptor clusters in MrgprB2-dependent bladder pain; use humanized mouse model
with targeted expression of MrgprX2 in MCs to test if human MrgprX2 also impacts bladder pain; use TRPV1+
nociceptor specific Piezo2 cKO mice and virally mediated ablation of Piezo2 function in bladder-innervating
nociceptors to determine if nociceptor-expressed mechanosensitive Piezo2 channels mediate bladder pain
induced by various irritants including LL-37, compound 48/80, or CYP. 2) Focus on differentiating visceral
nociceptors innervating both the bladder and colon and use unique chemical- and viral-mediated approaches to
either ablate or chemogenetically inhibit these distinct nociceptors to determine if they are required for the
generation of colon pain induced by bladder inflammation caused by LL-37, compound 48/80, or CYP; test if
MC-derived LTC4-neuronal CysLTR2 axis contributes to bladder pain and mediates inter-organ cross
sensitization in the colon.
Our findings will provide cellular and molecular basis for bladder pain and bladder-colon cross sensitization
mediated by the MrgprB2+ mast cell-TRPV1+ nociceptor clusters and will undoubtedly lead to new therapeutic
approaches for treating visceral pain."
10997271,"Vestibular deficits are highly prevalent and cause debilitating symptoms. Degeneration and ototoxin-
induced injury of vestibular hair cells (HCs) are underlying causes of some vestibular deficits. Remarkably,
adult mammals, including humans, can replace some vestibular HCs once they are lost. However, in rodents
and likely in humans, only one type of vestibular HC – type II (HCII) – is naturally replaced, and this degree of
regeneration does not restore vestibulo-motor functions. Functional testing by our group and others’ provides
strong evidence that the other type of vestibular HC – type I (HCI) – must be replaced to reverse vestibular
deficits. HCI are very different from HCII; for instance, they have longer and thicker stereocilia (the
mechanosensitive organelle of HCs), and they synapse on a single large calyx-shaped afferent terminal of a
vestibular ganglion neuron (VGN) rather than on the VGN’s bouton terminals, as HCII do. These features are
thought to endow HCI with functional specializations such as the ability to detect fast-onset, high-frequency
stimuli. However, we understand very little about how these specializations develop or which molecular
mechanisms control their genesis, differentiation, and maintenance in adult mammals. This lack of knowledge
hampers scientists’ efforts to determine how to drive functional regeneration in mammals after HC loss.
 Recently, we found that conditional knockout (cKO) of the transcription factor Sox2 from normal HCII
and from naturally regenerated HCII in adult mice drives many of them to partially convert toward the HCI fate,
including establishing the long, thick stereocilia unique to HCI. Sox2 cKO from adult HCII also triggers VGNs to
remove bouton terminals and extend a full or partial HCI-specific calyx terminal on the converting HCII.
However, reprogramming and synaptic remodeling of regenerated HCII after Sox2 deletion are insufficient to
recover vestibulo-motor functions. The objective of the proposed studies is to exploit these new findings to
investigate molecular mechanisms by which HCIs establish and maintain their type-specific hair bundle and
innervation phenotypes, which are critical for function. Aim 1 will use mouse multiomics and CUT&RUN to
define gene regulatory networks by which SOX2 in HCII blocks acquisition of HCI features, and it will begin to
define SOX2-independent mechanisms that promote the HCI fate. Aim 2 will use targeted gene deletion in
mice to identify novel SOX2-regulated genes that are required to develop and maintain the stereocilia
morphology of HCI. Aim 3 will use targeted loss and gain of gene function in mice to define novel SOX2-
regulated genes that are necessary in HCI to establish and maintain the calyx-type terminal and will employ
snRNAseq to identify new ligand-receptor pairs that may regulate VGN innervation of HCI and HCII. This
project will engage experts from four laboratories to generate new fundamental knowledge about how
vestibular HCs develop and maintain structures that are critical for sensory transduction and synaptic
transmission, providing new insights for strategies to regenerate vestibular HCs in adult mammals."

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which accounts for approximately 85% of all renal cancers, is resistant
to a variety of cancer therapies and is highly lethal. von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is the most important tumor
suppressor in renal cancer, its loss leads to hypoxia inducible factor  (HIF, including HIF1α and HIF2α)
accumulation. Although HIF2α inhibitor has been developed as a potential therapeutic target in renal cancer,
only a small propotion of patients will respond to HIF2α inhibitore treatment, suggesting the importance of
identifying additional therapeutic vulnerabilities in VHL-deficient kidney cancer. Methylation of adenosine (m6A)
determines the fate of modified messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and has recently been shown to play a key role
regulating gen expression critical in cancer development. Although previous research has suggested that m6A
may be important in renal cancer, the molecular mechanism behind its role in ccRCC tumorigenesis and
aggression is not yet well understood. Our preliminary data suggest that VHL binds to m6A enzymatic complex
proteins Mettl3/14 and regulates their interaction. By performing m6A RIP-Seq and RNA-Seq in renal cells with
and without VHL, we have identified a set of genes whose expression may be regulated by m6A in a VHL-
dependent manner. Among them, Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase Regulatory Subunit 3 (PIK3R3), an important
component of PI3K pathway, its mRNA stability is regulated by VHL in an m6A-dependent manner. Functionally,
PIK3R3 depletion promotes renal cell growth and tumor growth while its overexpression diminishes ccRCC cell
growth on 2-D colony formation, 3-D soft agar growth and tumor growth. We hypothesize that VHL regulates
m6A-dependent gene expression, thereby controlling ccRCC tumorigenesis. This is the first study to link
VHL with mRNA stability regulation via regulating the Mettl3/14 m6A enzymatic complex, which characterizes
the noncanonical function of VHL distinctive from its role as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. In Specific Aim 1, we will
determine the molecular mechanism by which VHL regulates m6A modification in kidney cancer. In Specific Aim
2, we will examine the functional role of VHL-m6A signaling in ccRCC tumorigenesis. Specifically, we will
examine the therapeutic efficacy or PI3K and AKT inhibitors in kidney cancer xenografts and patient derived
xenografts. Successful completion of these aims will provide mechanistic insight into a novel signaling pathway
on how VHL regulates gene expression important in ccRCC and set the foundation for therapeutic intervention
targeting the VHL-Mettl3/14-m6A signaling axis in ccRCC."
10998195,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The prevalence of cigarette smoking among individuals with substance use disorders (SUD) is nearly three times
higher than the prevalence of smoking among the general population. Individuals with SUD are more likely to
die from smoking-related illness than from complications associated with substance use. In addition to the direct
deleterious health effects of tobacco, continued smoking during SUD treatment is associated with worse
substance-related outcomes and greater odds of relapse. However, few SUD programs offer tobacco cessation
services and even when available, quit rates for individuals with SUD remain lower than the general population.
Tobacco cessation interventions that have been shown to be effective in general SUD treatment settings have
been multicomponent interventions that are time- and resource-intensive and expensive to implement. Thus,
there is a strong need to implement low-intensity, appealing interventions that can reduce the harms from
combustible tobacco among individuals in SUD treatment. Tobacco harm reduction strategies to reduce tobacco-
related morbidity and mortality among an SUD treatment population are an appealing and pragmatic approach
that may lead to greater uptake among clients, as well as program staff and leadership and may provide a viable
alternative to better serve clients (when deemed appropriate, but not as a replacement to cessation). One harm
reduction strategy is to ask smokers to switch completely to a non-combusted, electronic nicotine delivery system
(ENDS). A handful of rigorous RCTs have now shown that switching to ENDS has the potential to promote
abstinence from cigarettes better than traditional forms of pharmacotherapy in a general population of those who
smoke and are motivated to quit. However, switching to ENDS as a harm reduction strategy has yet to be
compared to pharmacotherapy among individuals with SUD (efficacy) and evaluated for acceptability and
appropriateness among clients, program staff and leadership (implementation). Further, smoking cessation
during SUD treatment has been shown to improve SUD outcomes and therefore it is critical to evaluate the
impact of tobacco harm reduction interventions on SUD outcomes and engagement. This study proposes a
Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of switching
to ENDS compared to quitting tobacco with an FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation (nicotine
replacement therapy [NRT]). This trial will enroll 240 clients across 3 South Carolina outpatient SUD programs.
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either switch to an ENDS product or to quit smoking with NRT. We will 1)
assess whether switching to ENDS better promotes biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence from
cigarettes at the 12-week end of treatment visit compared to NRT (Aim 1), 2) evaluate patient, provider, and
organizational-level implementation outcomes using mixed methods according to the Proctor framework (Aim
2), and 3) assess SUD treatment outcomes and engagement between groups to test for non-inferiority (Aim 3)."

Once thought to be immunologically privileged except in disease, the central nervous system (CNS) is now
understood to interact closely with the immune system even in the absence of pathology. Astrocytes, the most
abundant CNS glial cell, are key mediators of brain-immune cross-talk, interacting closely with microglia, forming
the glial limitans interfacing with and regulating the blood-brain barrier, and recruiting peripheral immune cells
into the CNS via the secretion of chemokines in disease. In response to CNS inflammation, astrocytes undergo
dramatic transcriptional and functional changes – a response termed ‘astrocyte reactivity’. Reactive astrocytes
are a common feature of nearly all injury and disease in the nervous system, yet our understanding of the role
of these cells in the pathogenesis of disease remains limited. Continually emerging evidence has shown that
astrocytes consist of heterogeneous subpopulations that vary greatly across different regions of the brain;
however, inflammatory astrocyte reactivity is still widely viewed as a homogeneous response. To explore
heterogeneity in reactive astrocyte responses to inflammation, I have performed paired single-nucleus RNA and
ATAC sequencing of astrocytes from mice injected with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
producing acute neuroinflammation and astrocyte reactivity. By profiling astrocytes across the whole forebrain,
I identified that, in the early phase of the inflammatory response, telencephalic reactive astrocytes highly express
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a secreted factor with anti-inflammatory properties in peripheral tissues. In
contrast, diencephalic reactive astrocytes produced 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (HPGD), the
enzyme responsible for degradation of the inflammatory eicosanoid prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The goal of this
proposal is to investigate the role of region-specific reactive astrocyte expression of HGF and HPGD in
the progression of neuroinflammation. Given HGF expression has been previously described as attenuating
inflammatory cytokine production by peripheral immune cells, I hypothesize that telencephalic reactive astrocyte
HGF inhibits microglial reactivity, reducing the production of inflammatory cytokines and suppressing
neuroinflammation. To test this hypothesis, experiments in Aim 1 will assess the effect of HGF on microglial
reactivity in vitro and in vivo using astrocyte-specific Hgf conditional knockout mice following LPS injection. As
hypothalamic PGE2-responsive neurons have been implicated in altered body temperature and anorexia during
neuroinflammation, Aim 2 will explore the effects of reactive astrocyte HPGD expression on the abundance of
PGE2 in the diencephalon, body temperature, and sickness behaviors following LPS injection in astrocyte-
specific Hpgd conditional knockout mice. Together, these experiments will provide novel characterization of the
functional roles of two region-specific reactive astrocyte factors which may affect the pathophysiology of
neuroinflammation, identifying new mechanisms which would contribute to many neurological diseases."
10999063,"Project Summary/Abstract
Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are the most common human birth defect. Although CHDs are highly
prevalent, knowledge regarding disease onset is currently limited, restricting therapeutic progression. CHDs
can arise due to the altered contribution of cardiac progenitor cell populations, including cardiac neural crest
cells (NCCs), a vital migratory and multipotent cell population for proper mammalian heart formation. The
fundamental Hippo signaling pathway is crucial in regulating heart development and homeostasis. Patient data
and animal models have indicated that changes in Hippo signaling result in various types of CHDs. The
canonical Hippo downstream effectors Yap and Taz are essential for NCC regulation throughout the developing
embryo, yet their role in NCC-derived heart development remains unknown. I maintain a mouse cohort with a
Cre recombinase conditional deletion of Yap/Taz in the NCC population and found that Yap/Taz deficiencies in
NCCs result in external and internal cardiac defects, creating a CHD mouse model. Furthermore, I identified
that deficiencies of Yap/Taz reduced cardiac outflow tract (OFT) cell migration capabilities ex vivo and in vitro.
This project aims to define how mutant Hippo signaling drives the dysregulation of NC and cardiac
development. I hypothesize that the Hippo signaling effectors Yap/Taz regulate proper cardiac remodeling
during NCC-derived heart development. Aim 1 will investigate the role of Yap/Taz in cardiac OFT development
by characterizing altered cellular composition due to Yap/Taz deficiencies and performing sc-multi-omics on
control and Yap/Taz deficient cardiac OFTs. Aim 2 will explore the mechanism underlying Hippo-regulated NCC
differentiation and its impact on cardiac tissue stiffness both in vivo and in vitro. This project will elucidate the
roles of Hippo signaling in NCC-derived heart development. Findings from these proposed studies will shed
light on the molecular mechanisms regulating heart development and help develop novel diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies for CHDs."
10976283,"This application for R21 grant, entitled, “Humanized mouse model of periodontitis”, proposes to develop a
humanized mouse model of periodontitis to study the possible pathogenic roles of Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D)
expressed on human osteoclasts in periodontitis lesion. NSG-SGM3-W41 mouse strain which is one of the
most advanced immunodeficient mouse strains developed by Dr. Shultz at the Jackson Laboratory allows to
reconstruct the full immune compartments containing both myeloid and lymphoid cell populations following
transplantation of human hematopoietic stem cells (hHSC) and thymus organoids both of which will be
developed from the same HLA-homozygous iPS cells without conditioning by irradiation. This humanized
mouse can have osteoclasts differentiated from monocyte linage cells derived from hHSC. We hypothesize
that Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg)-mediated upregulation of Sema4D expressed by human OCs, but not T
cells, promotes pathogenic bone resorption and inflammation, but suppresses OB-genesis in periodontitis
induced in humanized mice. Aforementioned hypothesis will be tested by following two aims: 1) To profile
immune compartments and OCs of human origins in humanized NSG-SGM3-W41 mice which are induced of
periodontitis, and 2) To establish the roles of Sema4D released from human OCs in promoting periodontal
bone loss and suppressing OB-genesis using a humanized mouse model of periodontitis.
Because periodontal bone loss induced in rodents is spontaneously regenerated after the removal of
inflammatory stimuli, it has been argued that rodents may not be appropriate models for human periodontitis.
However, we for the first time developed and published irreversible bone loss induced in mice by live Pg-soaked
ligature attachment. To discriminate the possible engagement of Sema4D produced by platelets, T cells and
OCs, using a liposome-clodronate protocol that depletes human platelets, T cells and mouse monocyte lineage
cells (including osteoclasts), we will evaluate the periodontal bone outcomes from the Sema4D increased on
the human OCs in humanized NSG-SGM3-W41 mice in the absence of mouse OCs.
This humanized mouse model of periodontitis would allow us to investigate the interaction between the human
host immune system and human periodontal pathogens, such as Pg, in the physiological context. A humanized
mouse model of periodontitis would also provide a platform for understanding the susceptibility of individuals to
develop a particular systemic disease and support preclinical examinations of precision medicine. Upon our
successful completion of this proposed study, it is anticipated that the roles of human Sema4D produced by
human osteoclasts, in comparison to that produced by T cells and platelets, in periodontitis will be
characterized. In sum, the proposed humanized mouse model of periodontitis has potential to be the next
generation biological tool for pathophysiological and pharmacological studies of periodontitis."
10978351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Radiation therapy (RT) is widely used to treat localized prostate cancer (PCa). However, cancer cells often
develop resistance to RT through unknown mechanisms, resulting in cancer recurrence. To improve RT, there
is a dire need to uncover cellular events that cause cells to become resistant. We previously demonstrated that
PCa heterogeneity, particularly in prostate cancers with an abundant mitochondria subpopulation, often survive
and regrow after RT (termed radiation resistant prostate cancer, or RR-PCa). Elevation of mitochondrial mass,
number, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and biogenesis markers is acquired in RR-PCa cells. We further
demonstrated that knockdown of the mitochondrial biogenesis regulator, TFAM (transcription factor A,
mitochondrial), significantly restored the sensitivity of RR-PCa cells to RT. Hence, our overarching hypothesis is
that RT-activated mitochondrial biogenesis, via ROS, is an acquisition mechanism that drives PCa survival post-
RT, a premise that will undergo stringent examination in the proposed studies. ROS are known to directly and
indirectly regulate mitochondrial homeostasis through fusion, fission, mitophagy, and biogenesis. We screened
FDA-approved drugs in search of compounds that are nontoxic to normal cells and have the ability to raise the
level of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide (mtH2O2) in PCa cells while blocking mitochondrial protein translation.
We found azithromycin (AZM), a macrolide antibiotic, to be an effective prototype compound that possesses
both properties. We further demonstrated that AZM combined with RT enhances the death of PCa cells with an
abundant mitochondrial subpopulation, compared to AZM or RT alone. Thus, we propose to advance our findings
and identify the mechanism(s) that effectively inhibit the survival of post-irradiated cancer cells, to improve RT
efficacy. The specific aims are: 1) to define the molecular mechanism(s) by which RT-activated mitochondrial
biogenesis promotes cell survival and metabolic adaptations of PCa cells with abundant mitochondria, both in
vitro and in vivo; 2) to determine if overloading mtH2O2 to target inherent mitochondria and RT-acquired
mitochondria while blocking mitochondrial protein translation in RT-acquired mitochondria enhances
radiosensitivity of RR-PCa cells, and 3) to improve RT using a mtH2O2 generator and a mitochondrial protein
translation inhibitor, AZM as prototype, in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model and a patient-derived xenograft
model of PCa with activated mitochondrial biogenesis. This study uses state-of-the-art platforms including the
reverse phase protein array, stable isotope-resolved metabolomics, super-resolution microscopy with Imaris
software, TEMPOL-enhanced MRI imaging, and a high resolution O2k-FluoRespirometer. The proposed studies
are expected to uncover novel molecular insights by which concurrently targeting mitochondrial redox capacity
and mitochondrial biogenesis improve RT efficacy of RR-PCa."
10978400,"The world is rapidly heading towards a pre-1940’s scenario when it comes to fighting infectious disease.
Antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem on a global scale, greatly hampering our abilities to quell worldwide
epidemics such as influenza, SARS, COVID-19, tuberculosis and malaria, as well as the simple staphylococcus
infection. Unless innovative strategies are developed to produce robust and effective new classes of antibiotics,
health care costs will continue to climb and we will completely lose our ability to combat even the most common
infection. Influenza and coronavirus (SARS and COVID-19) create an even more urgent need for targeting
resistant bacteria related to lung infections, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), a common
example of CRE being Klebsiella Pneumoniae (KP). Recent article by J. Gerberding, former CDC director states
“The patients at greatest risk from superbugs like CRE and other bacterial pathogens that cause lung diseases,
are the ones who are already more vulnerable to illness from viral lung infections like influenza, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS), and COVID-19. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, for example, claimed nearly
300,000 lives around the world. Many of those deaths — between 29% and 55% — were actually caused
by secondary bacterial pneumonia, according to the CDC.” A recent study (Zhou, Lancet 2020, 395, 1054-1062)
from Wuhan reports that almost 50% of COVID-19 related deaths showed evidence of secondary bacterial
infections (pneumonia, sepsis, bloodstream infections).
Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistance to 2-3 classes), extensive drug resistance (XDR, resistance to
most classes except colistin or tigecycline) and even pan drug resistance (PDR, resistance to all classes)
nosocomial bacterial infections have skyrocketed in recent years, and the emergence of pan drug-resistant
isolates are making these infections increasingly difficult to treat. Hospital-acquired infections like these account
for up to 4% of all hospital stays in the United States and are incredibly diverse in causative pathogen, antibiotic
resistance profile, and severity. A significant cause of nosocomial infection is the Enterobacteriaceae family,
which includes Gram-negative bacilli that can be commensal or pathogenic. Enterobacteriaceae have a
widespread clinical and economic impact due to the diversity of infections they cause; this family causes many
infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections (BSIs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), and intra-abdominal
infections (IAIs). The World Health Organization (WHO) lists carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)
as having a critical need for novel antibiotics on their Priority Pathogens list. Because the mortality of these multi
drug-resistant infections is between 30 and 50% and there is such difficulty in finding viable treatments, the need
for novel therapeutics for these pathogens must be addressed.
One of the challenges of research in infectious diseases is to find ways to use the increasing knowledge of the
mechanisms underlying disease biology, transformation and progression to develop novel therapeutic strategies
targeting MDR, XDR, and PDR bacterial infections. Targeting heavily conserved RNA sequences and structures,
present in the 4 billion years old bacterial ribosome, and involved in proliferation and survival of bacteria, is a
promising approach. RNA, the essential nucleic acid component of the ribosome, is a validated target for drug
design, both as therapeutic and as a target. We will target specific rRNA single strands, which are conserved
across prokaryotes, essential for translation initiation but absent in eukaryotes, ensuring that a drug targeting
this sequence can function as a broad spectrum therapeutic. In the proposed work, we will construct sequence-
specific chemically modified rRNA targeting oligomers that can be effectively delivered inside the cell. Short RNA
will be exploited as target for synthetic molecules that inactivate the functioning of the ribosome, stopping
bacterial protein synthesis and causing bacterial death. NUBAD’s unique experimental approaches and
technologies will allow us to target rRNA combinations not previously explored for susceptibility against bacteria.
The work proposed is a multidisciplinary effort encompassing solid-phase organic synthesis, oligonucleotide
stability and delivery, RNA targeted screening, antimicrobial activity, ADME TOX, and in vivo efficacy studies
describes the development of sequence-specific cell permeable binders of rRNA. The success of the proposed
work would be a significant addition to currently available ribosome-specific approaches in drug development.
We propose using a small rRNA target sequence, heavily conserved in prokaryotes, to design conjugates that
can be employed to inhibit microbial growth, opening possibilities for developing sequence-specific RNA targeted
therapeutics. This work addresses an important world health issue, antimicrobial resistance, and presents
creative steps towards a novel solution to this problem."
10999144,"Abstract
The lethal rabies encephalitis diseases are caused by members of the zoonotic lyssavirus genus. The high
genetic diversity separates lyssavirus members into three phylogroups, while cross-phylogroup (especially to
phylogroups 2 and 3) protection has not been established by current post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) or
antibody therapeutics. To achieve more broadly effective countermeasures to rabies disease worldwide and to
prepare for the emergence of new lyssaviruses, effective therapeutic agents against all phylogroups are
necessary. Lyssavirus G glycoprotein is the sole antibody target on the virion surface, which adopt distinct
conformations between pre- and post- fusion states as other class-III viral fusion machineries. Domain-III of
lyssavirus G glycoprotein encompasses a large neutralizing antibody-accessible surface in the native state.
Sequence analysis on domain-III revealed several conserved patches across all phylogroups, which could
potentially serve as target epitopes for pan-lyssavirus neutralizers. Antigen-specific nanobodies have been
considered as promising therapeutic agents against various infectious diseases and non-infectious diseases,
which have the advantage in binding compact and hidden epitopes that are out of reach for conventional
antibodies. We hypothesized that by focusing immune recognition on the lyssavirus G domain-III conserved
epitopes, we can identify pan-lyssavirus neutralizing nanobodies for immunotherapeutics. In this study, we
propose two specific aims: (1) to use a structure-based and antibody-guided approach to design and characterize
the antigenicity of lyssavirus glycoprotein domain-III, a site of viral vulnerability targeted by several broadly
neutralizing antibodies, for revelation of the antibody neutralization mechanism; (2) to identify and characterize
pan-lyssavirus neutralizing nanobodies for therapeutics by focusing immune recognition on lyssavirus G domain
III conserved epitopes."
11000195,"ABSTRACT: 13th International Conference on Neural Tube Defects
Neural tube defects (NTDs), including spina bifida (SB) and anencephaly, are common and severe birth defects
that arise from complex gene interactions, which are influenced by environmental stresses. One of the best-
known but still poorly understood influences on NTD risk is the folate-one carbon metabolic pathway. In
susceptible clinical populations, folic acid (FA) supplementation can prevent up to 70% of NTD occurrences.
This still leaves 30% of the population without options for improving gestational outcomes. Despite FA fortification
of the food supply and vitamin supplementation, NTDs affect up to 2,300 births in the US annually and hundreds
of thousands more worldwide. Advances in surgical and supportive care have progressively extended the life
expectancy of SB patients, who nevertheless face numerous concomitant challenges beyond physical mobility
that threaten length and quality of their lives. Today, over 75% of SB live births survive into adulthood and some
166,000 individuals with SB currently live in the US, more than half of whom are adults. Thus, it is imperative to
not only understand the mechanisms leading to SB, but also the attendant mechanisms that underlie the
postnatal developmental delays and comorbidities to SB that impact health related quality of life (HRQOL).
Significant co-morbidities go well beyond hydrocephalus requiring CSF shunting, and include orthopedic issues,
bladder and bowel dysfunction. Among these co-morbidities, neuropathic bowel dysfunction is the least
understood and perhaps the most limiting in terms of social isolation and maintenance of skin integrity. In addition
to these physical challenges, the range of cognitive developmental outcomes in SB patients can vary widely.
Prognosis for an affected infant is difficult to accurately assess. Knowledge of individual genetic SB risk could
enrich prognosis capabilities to indicate metabolic inefficiencies, improve options for tailored early behavioral
intervention, early screening for epilepsy risk, or indicate propensity for chromatin remodeling or epigenetic
influences that could be regulated to optimize neurodevelopmental outcome. In the setting of these clinical and
experimental challenges, there is a critical need to form synergistic collaborations to accelerate the translation
of research findings into better diagnoses, preventions, and treatments for NTDs.
The 13th International Conference on Neural Tube Defects will bring together expert scientists, clinicians and
epidemiologist/public health officials who collectively spend their energies trying to develop innovative evidenced
based preventative and treatment paradigms that can mitigate the myriad of clinical and societal problems
associated with these devastating disorders. The proposed meeting of this group in August 2024 will bring
together the leading experts in the world as well as their trainees to share their latest research and clinical
findings concerning NTDs. The success of the previous twelve conferences has spurred a vast number of new
collaborations and created a consortia of research teams around the world who are striving for the day when
preventable NTDs are indeed, prevented."
11000227,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The main goal of the RUNX1 Research Program 8th Annual Scientific Conference and Patient Meeting is to
create a dynamic convening in order to foster collaboration and provide opportunities for knowledge and data
sharing among a diverse set of researchers, clinicians, and patients and their families for a rare disease called
RUNX1 familial platelet disorder with predisposition to hematologic malignancies (RUNX1-FPD or FPDMM).
Individuals with the disorder have a 35-50% lifetime risk of developing a hematologic malignancy. Of those who
develop a malignancy, over 50% are diagnosed with AML. It is the only convening of its kind and continues to
be an important part of discovery and future therapies for the disorder as well as an opportunity for early career
investigators, posts and graduate students to present their research.
Conference participation has grown each year. We had over 181 attendees for the virtual conference in 2021.
In 2022, we had 130 individuals - 40 patients and 90 scientists, clinicians and genetic counselors - who
attended in-person in Princeton, NJ. Due to NCATS/NIH funding, we were able to award five (5) deserving
young investigators with travel scholarships to attend the conference in 2022 and present at the poster
sessions. In 2023, we returned to a virtual format with 397 registrants and 219 participants. We also once
again held a poster session with four (4) young investigators - three of which were women and one was
African-American.
In previous years, over 50% of research attendees were women, 30% of attendees were post-docs or graduate
students, and 15% of independent investigators were 5 years or less in their first faculty position. We plan to
continue to engage a diverse audience of investigators. RRP is committed to engaging patients, clinicians
and/or researchers from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to broaden participation from these
communities at our conference and beyond.
The agenda includes research-specific sessions open to all stakeholders as well as a track dedicated to
RUNX1-FPD patients and family members. The objective is to promote and drive patient-engaged research
forward, with direct patient input in the development and planning of the sessions via our 23-member Research
Guided by Patients Committee (RGPC).
The research focused portion of the meeting will bring together experts from the fields of hematology,
immunology, oncology, cell therapy and basic science who are committed to uncovering the mechanisms
underlying the pathogenesis of RUNX1-FPD with the goal of developing therapeutic interventions that impact
both the bleeding issues and most importantly the predisposition to malignancy. The audience will include
investigators devoted to studying RUNX1, leukemia progression, clonal hematopoiesis, gene editing, and
hematopoietic stem cell transplants. It has become increasingly clear through the NHGRI-sponsored natural
history study of RUNX1-FPD that immune dysfunction and inflammatory disorders are common. RUNX1-FPD
includes a unique patient population where there may be a nexus between immunology and oncology based
entirely on activity of a single master regulator, RUNX1."
10999946,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and overweight/obesity (OOB) are highly prevalent conditions that contribute
substantially to global disease burden. Alongside recent increases in the prevalence of AUD and alcohol-
attributable mortality, projections indicate that up to one half of U.S. adults will live with obesity by the end of
this decade. Because each condition confers increased risk for numerous chronic health conditions, those with
co-occurring alcohol use disorder and overweight/obesity (AUD-OOB) are at increased risk for negative health
outcomes. The emergence of highly effective incretin-based therapies for diabetes and OOB, including
glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, is rapidly expanding the range of effective treatments for
those with OOB and cardiometabolic disorders. Moreover, preclinical findings and clinical observations suggest
that GLP-1 receptor agonists can reduce alcohol consumption. Tirzepatide, the first dual GLP-1 and GIP
(glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptor agonist, shows superior efficacy for weight loss
compared to the most effective GLP-1 receptor mono-agonists. Tirzepatide (Zepbound) received FDA approval
for the treatment of overweight/obesity in November 2023. Recent findings further show that tirzepatide has
protective effects on cardiovascular risk outcomes and projected risk of cardiovascular disease. Based on
epidemiological trends and the high prevalence of metabolic conditions in those with alcohol use disorder, an
increasing number of heavy drinkers are likely to receive treatment with tirzepatide. Should tirzepatide prove
effective for reducing alcohol consumption, the identification of a treatment for co-occurring alcohol use
disorder and overweight/obesity could achieve significant long-term health impact. The aim of this study is to
expedite clinical research on dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists in participants with AUD-OOB by conducting a
Phase II randomized trial of tirzepatide. Adults with AUD-OOB will be recruited for a double-blind, between-
subjects trial using dose-escalating treatment with tirzepatide (Zepbound) over 8 weeks. Prospective changes
in alcohol use, weight, and cardiometabolic outcomes will be measured at weekly clinic visits. By expediting
clinical research on tirzepatide, a new treatment poised for widespread clinical use, this project will position the
field for larger clinical trials of dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists as potential treatments for co-occurring AUD
and OOB."

Exosomes are a type of small extracellular vesicle (EV) secreted from all kinds of cells, derived from
endosomes. They have many physiological and pathological functions, such as cell proliferation and
differentiation, angiogenesis and wound healing, regulation of immunity, and cancer progression. They also
play roles in maintaining tumor microenvironments and driving cancer metastasis through cargo delivery to
recipient cells in paracrine and autocrine manners. The laboratory of Dr. Alissa Weaver (Unit Director) at
Vanderbilt University School of Medicine studies the regulation of cancer cell migration and invasion by
exosomes and the role of cancer cell exosomes in cancer aggressiveness and metastasis. The lab also carries
out research on the biogenesis of RNA-containing exosomes and the development of imaging tools to track
exosomes. The proposed studies for this R50 application of Dr. Bong Hwan Sung (Research Specialist) are
related to two NCI-funded R01 grants: 1. Exosome secretion in breast cancer progression. This project tests
the central hypothesis that adhesion molecules carried by cancer and fibroblast exosomes drive multiple steps
of the metastatic cascade in breast cancer. 2. Regulation of extracellular vesicle biogenesis through cell
adhesion. This project tests the hypothesis that the biogenesis of motility-promoting EVs in cancer is controlled
by syntenin-dependent regulation of EV formation and cargo loading downstream of activated leukocyte cell
adhesion molecule (ALCAM)-mediated adhesions. Dr. Sung has worked with Dr. Weaver for the past 15
years. As an expert in cell biology, EVs, and imaging techniques, Dr. Sung has set up state-of-the-art imaging
techniques, and developed experimental and imaging tools and image analysis methods in her laboratory.
This project will support those ongoing efforts."

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) and recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) continue to increase worldwide and in the
U.S. and are associated with Diabetes Mellitus (CP-DM). Observational studies indicate higher morbidity in
individuals with CP-DM compared to Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Observational mostly retrospective
studies also describe worse glycemic control in CP-DM compared to T2DM; earlier and increased need for
insulin, and an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia requiring assistance from third party in CP-DM when
compared to T2DM significantly impacting the quality of life of these patients. Therefore, there is a need to test
better and specific antihyperglycemic therapy for CP-DM with scientifically rigorous clinical trials. To our
knowledge, very few or no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the efficacy of
antihyperglycemic therapies when compared to control or to each other in CP-DM. Animal model data indicate
that pioglitazone (PIO) may be a safe and effective treatment for hyperglycemia in pancreatitis. Extensive
human investigations indicate that PIO improves insulin resistance and insulin secretion in T2DM. When tested
in T2DM, RCTs of PIO have shown antihyperglycemic efficacy, durability, and favorable impact on
cardiovascular (CV) disease and hyperlipidemia. PIO also decreases systemic inflammation. Safety of PIO has
been extensively studied and confirmed though it should be used with caution in the long-term. SGLT2
inhibitors particularly Empagliflozin (EMPA) also improve hyperglycemia, decrease blood pressure, and body
weight and decrease CV and renal adverse events in T2D. They could also be associated with unique adverse
events. We are proposing a pilot, parallel group, randomized, dose escalation clinical trial of PIO versus EMPA
lasting 24 weeks with dose escalation at 12 weeks or earlier based on pre-specified rules at 2 of the sites
(Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN and U of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) in the NIH funded consortium for chronic
pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer (CPDPC). Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
HbA1c lowering with PIO is non-inferior to EMPA in CP-DM with primary end point of the trial being
improvement in Hemoglobin A1c. Secondary end points are multiple and include other measures of efficacy,
mechanism, and safety. This is a pilot clinical trial for CP-DM without a precedent for this type of study; this is a
challenge and precedent in itself for trial design but successful completion of this trial will enable the design
and conduct of a multi-center RCT intervention to be conducted by the CPDPC in a larger CP-DM population
to improve glycemic control."

 About 50% of high grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) exhibit defects in homologous recombination (HR;
e.g. BRCA1/2 mutations). Approximately 20% HGSOC and 50% of serous endometrial cancer (EMCA) exhibit
CCNE1 amplification. About 50% clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC) have ARID1A loss. My research goal is to
exploit genetic vulnerabilities in gynecological cancers with scientifically rational drug combinations.
 First, CCNE1 amplification promotes loss of G1-S checkpoint and increased reliance on the G2-M checkpoint
for survival. Ovarian and endometrial cancers with CCNE1 amplification are platinum resistant with poor
outcomes. I will test new therapies that exploit survival pathways critical for survival in CCNE1 oncogene addicted
cells. I will also determine if other biomarkers in addition to CCNE1 correlate with response to effective targeted
therapies.
 Second, rare gynecological cancers lack preclinical models for drug discovery. We will expand our existing
PDX and organoid platform to include rare tumor types. We will also test new strategies that exploit the genetics
of these rate tumor types such as low-grade serous ovarian cancer. In addition, I will perform deep genomic and
transcriptomic studies to identify biomarker signatures that predict response to DNA Damage Response (DDR)
inhibitor combinations using PDXs and patient samples from an ongoing phase IB clinical trial. I will also identify
new targets for ARID1Amut clear cell ovarian cancer using a CRISPR screen targeting functional protein domains.
 Lastly, PARP inhibitors (PARPi) represent a significant advance in ovarian cancer treatment with HR deficiency;
however, tumors ultimately acquire resistance. I showed that combination PARPi-ATRi overcomes PARPi
resistance in cell lines and PDX models (Nature Commun, 2020) which led to Phase II clinical trial. We will now
determine if combination therapy can be augmented by activating the immune system. We will test new strategies
such as radionucleotides to overcoming PARPi resistance. Lastly, we will further evaluate a non-invasive
molecular imaging tool to predict response to PARPi therapies.
 In summary, these studies have a significant impact to advance cancer therapies for women with
gynecological malignancies into the clinic."

Ostechondritis dissecans (OCD) is a developmental orthopaedic disease affecting children and young adults. It
is characterized by formation of osteochondral flaps or fragments within joints which causes pain and disability
and predisposes to early onset osteoarthritis. Although recent studies demonstrated that discrete areas of
epiphyseal cartilage necrosis (termed osteochondrosis), caused by focal failure of vascular supply, are the
clinically silent precursor lesions of OCD, it is yet to be established how the extent of the inciting vascular
failure, along with exposure to biomechanical trauma, determine whether these lesions heal or progress to
clinically apparent disease.
The overall objective of this proposal is to use porcine models to understand factors that influence the
development, progression, and healing of OCD lesions. To achieve this objective, we will use two specific aims
to test our central hypothesis that the extent of ischemic epiphyseal cartilage necrosis determines the
development of OCD, and that lesion progression is influenced by biomechanical stress. Specifically, our aims
have been designed (1) to investigate the relationship between the severity of vascular injury to the femoral
trochlear epiphyseal cartilage and the formation and progression of OCD precursor lesions and (2) to
determine the role that low vs. high impact biomechanical stress plays in the formation of subclinical
osteochondrosis lesions and their progression to clinically apparent OCD.
Our study will establish how the extent of vascular failure and exposure to biomechanical stress drive the
clinical course of OCD and determine characteristic gene expression profiles across OCD lesion types.
Conducting these studies in a large animal model will ensure timely translation of our results to inform clinical
decision making in human patients, and will also help establish controlled exercise as a component of non-
operative treatment. Importantly, these findings will also have applicability to other juvenile orthopaedic
disorders of vascular origin such as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease."

Tick-borne Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging public health threat, but has been understudied to date.
Since its discovery in 1958, human cases of POWV have been reported in the United States, Canada, and
Russia. Starting in 2006, confirmed cases of POWV have increased in both frequency and scope in New
England and the Upper Midwest. Notably, POWV is now considered an emerging public health threat because
it has been frequently associated with the aggressive, human-biting blacklegged tick vector, Ixodes scapu-
laris. The future spread of POWV is unpredictable, but it will be important to understand the potential for more
widespread emergence. The goals of this project are to evaluate whether there are regional, local, and even
hyperlocal differences in the genetic structure of tick and POWV populations that affect patterns of POWV
host/vector competence, virulence, and evolution. These questions are important because our knowledge of
how tick-borne flaviviruses are maintained in distinct transmission foci and how new transmission foci emerge
is limited. Accordingly, through this NIH/NIAID R01, we will seek to examine these relationships across Minne-
sota and New York, two states with increasing burdens of tick-borne disease risk. There are 3 specific aims:
1. Assess the distribution and genetic structure of POWV and Ixodes scapularis from distinct foci
 in the Northeast (NY) and Midwest (MN) U.S.
2. Evaluate the extent to which tick population interacts with viral genotype to drive local adapta-
 tion and regional variability in Ixodes scapularis competence for POWV.
 3. Determine how POWV genetic variability and regional selective pressures impact host compe-
 tence and disease heterogeneity.
In these studies, we will expand POWV surveillance activities in MN to intensely sample POWV genomes and
tick populations from across the state. The NY State Department of Health has a robust POWV surveillance
program in place for this project that we will leverage. We will also seek to understand the phenotypic and ge-
notypic underpinnings of virus–host dynamics for POWV using mouse and tick experimental systems. These
studies are critically important because POWV likely will continue to emerge in the future. Therefore, under-
standing how POWV overcomes evolutionary barriers to emerge and cause disease in humans will be critical
for prediction, prevention, and control of this arboviral disease."

βII-spectrin, a ubiquitous component of the neuronal cytoskeleton, plays multifaceted roles in the organization
and function of neurons. We recently reported that de novo variants in SPTBN1, which encodes βII-spectrin,
cause a pediatric syndrome characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, ADHD, autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), movement deficits, and epilepsy. However, the neuronal types and pathways that are
most vulnerable to deficits in βII-spectrin function are largely unexplored.
We found that mice with selective loss of βII-spectrin in cerebellar granule cells exhibit symptoms and behaviors
consistent with the clinical presentations observed in individuals carrying pathogenic SPTBN1 variants. The
cerebellum, previously assumed to mostly modulate fine-motor coordination, plays important roles in cognition
and is suspected to contribute to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental diseases. Thus, it is important to
define the normal and pathogenic mechanisms modulated by βII-spectrin function in the cerebellum.
To accomplish these goals, we will combine cellular, biochemical, live and super-resolution microscopies, and
electrophysiological techniques with behavioral paradigms to 1) determine the molecular mechanisms underlying
disruption of excitable axonal domains and synaptic transmission in cerebellar granule cells caused by βII-
spectrin deficiencies and 2) leverage novel transgenic mouse models carrying clinically relevant Sptbn1 variants
to assess their effect on cerebellar molecular, cellular, and synaptic function and clinically relevant behaviors."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Non-Coding RNA Biology: New Roles and
Diversity, organized by Drs. Sebastian Kadener, Irene Bozzoni and Luisa Cochella. The conference will be held
in Keystone, Colorado from January 27–31, 2025.
Recent investigation into non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have revealed a wide range of key functions in both cellular
and organismal processes. These molecules come in varied sizes and shapes, ranging from small to large, linear
to circular, containing standard nucleotides to heavily modified structures. Some ncRNAs are known to regulate
gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by facilitating or disrupting interactions
between RNA-RNA, protein-RNA or DNA-RNA complexes. However, while the field has focused on identification
of ncRNAs and molecular mechanisms, their diverse in vivo functions are only beginning to emerge.
Therefore, this conference program was designed to reveal these essential functions of ncRNAs to fill this
knowledge gap. The sessions are organized to promote crosstalk and synergy between researchers working
on distinct types of RNAs, to elucidate common mechanisms of action or impacts on common cellular
processes and outcomes. The goal is to unite different sub-fields of ncRNA research, by bringing together
scientists studying different systems, approaches and types of ncRNAs, as well as mRNAs with non-coding
functions, to collectively address key roles in cellular and organismal biology. This conference will be held
jointly with the Keystone Symposium on RNA Mediated Regulation of Immunity: Mechanism, Disease and
Therapeutics to enable cross-disciplinary insights and collaborations towards mechanisms and impacts of
ncRNA on immune system function."
10986273,"There is widespread agreement that fairness—ensuring equitable performance across similarly situated
individuals and across groups—is a fundamental principle for ethical development of artificial intelligence for
health care (AI-HC). In the U.S., the NIH has launched initiatives to address unfairness due to lack of diversity
in datasets, such as the All of Us Research Program and the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium.
Other efforts focus on diversity and representation among researchers. However, it is not yet clear whether
these initiatives are sufficient to achieve fairness in AI-HC. Concepts and practices associated with diversity
and representation shape the extent to which AI-HC researchers and developers achieve goals for fairness.
Yet insufficient understanding of how diversity and representation are conceptualized and put into practice
within AI-HC projects is an impediment to achieving fairness in AI-HC datasets. Prior studies of biomedical
research indicate that scientists often hold differing concepts of diversity (e.g. genetic or other biomarkers, self-
reported race/ethnicity) and representation (e.g., the inclusion of specific historically underrepresented groups
in datasets vs. addressing how structural inequalities impact the data for underrepresented groups). In turn,
these concepts shape implementation of the practices used to achieve diversity and representation in datasets,
such as diversification of researchers, research participants, or technical solutions to bias. We propose to
assess how diversity and representation are conceptualized and put into practice in 50 NIH-funded AI-HC
research projects. Our analysis will be guided by Steven Epstein’s “inclusion-and-difference paradigm” as a
conceptual framework. We will employ a “microethics” perspective, which focuses analysis on how high-level
ethical goals, like fairness, are understood and put into practice in technical fields. This perspective allows
examination of how different actors (e.g. data scientists, clinicians, annotators) involved in AI dataset
development perceive three sets of issues: how diversity and representation are defined; trade-offs in scientific
and diversity goals; and the downstream impact on fairness. Informed by these findings, we will develop
evidence-informed practical guidance to support the future creation of fair datasets in AI-HC. Our aims are to:
Aim 1: Assess data scientists’ concepts and practices relevant to diversity and representation in
creating datasets for AI-HC will be achieved through a review of policy and guidance documents (Aim 1a)
and interviews of approximately 100 investigators from 50 systematically sampled NIH-funded AI-HC research
projects (Aim 1b). Aim 2: Formulate and disseminate practical, evidence-informed guidance to support
fairness in AI-HC development will be achieved through a modified Delphi process engaging experts in areas
relevant to fairness, diversity and representation in AI-HC. We will use a multi-pronged strategy to encourage
uptake and implementation of guidance through the Bridge2AI program, the Center for ELSI Resources and
Analysis, and interactive, case-based design exercises and workshops."
10986364,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects a patient’s memory, language, and
executive function. AD affects one in nine (>10%) in the US aged 65 years and older. The specific pathogenesis
and the underlying neurophysiology of AD have not been fully understood. The white matter (WM) regions of the
brain, making up approximately 50% of the total brain volume, provide the communication pathways necessary
for information exchange between gray matter (GM) cortical regions, and many brain disorders have been
associated with WM deficiencies. Recent developments in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(rfMRI) have enabled the study of the human brain’s functional connectivity and functional networks. Studies
have found that there is detectable functional connectivity within WM regions and between WM and GM regions.
However, these findings were based on healthy adults, and WM-rfMRI of typical aging and AD are not known.
In this study, we will systematically characterize the signal properties of WM-rfMRI of typical aging, mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and AD progression. We will characterize the functional connections between the WM and GM
regions and the underlying WM structural tracts. We will also investigate how WM-rfMRI is associated with
phenotypic traits in MCI and AD. We will use five large neuroimaging datasets with a total of more than 5,200
subjects for the aims of this study.
The rationale for this study is based on our preliminary studies that investigated WM-rfMRI of healthy adults from
the Human Connectome Project dataset. We found that WM-rfMRI was associated with GM-rfMRI functional
networks and that there was a significant overlap between the WM--rfMRI and the underlying WM structural
tracts. In this study, we will build on our previous studies to examine WM-rfMRI properties of typical aging, MCI,
and AD. Aim1: To characterize WM-rfMRI of typical aging. Aim 2: To characterize WM-rfMRI of MCI and AD;
Aim 3: To investigate WM-rfMRI–phenotype associations and the predictability of phenotypes in MCI and AD.
Aim 4: To develop and disseminate a WM-rfMRI in Aging, MCI, and AD toolbox. We hypothesize that the WM-
rfMRI properties will have significant test-retest reliability, will be significantly different among typical aging, MCI
and AD and can reliably predict clinical scores of MCI and AD. We will apply advanced analytic and machine
learning approaches on WM-rfMRI for the aims of this study. To the best of our knowledge, this study will be one
of the first to perform a comprehensive analysis of WM-rfMRI in typical aging, MCI, and AD. This study will
contribute towards uncovering potential WM-rfMRI markers of MCI and AD, and will facilitate the use of WM-
rfMRI in future aging studies. This study will also provide a strong foundation to study brain function and
dysfunction as an integrated system of both WM and GM. The long-term goal of this project is to better
understand the effect of WM structure and function on cognition, and to apply rfMRI for more reliable diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment of AD."

 Cognitive dysfunction (CD) is a common neuropsychiatric manifestation of childhood-onset systemic
lupus erythematosus (cSLE) that remains poorly diagnosed and undertreated. CD and other neuropsychiatric
symptoms of cSLE can negatively impact school function, self-management, and psychosocial health, as well
as lifelong health-related quality of life and occupational opportunity during adulthood. While prior studies in
patients with cSLE point to the association of CD with volumetric reductions of gray and white matter, the
functional neurobiological aberrancies underlying CD and their relationship to negative health-related behaviors
remain largely understudied. Furthermore, in a heightened inflammatory state, the homeostasis of the CNS is
likely compromised, implicating neuroimmune systems such as the choroid plexus, which serve as blood-
cerebral spinal fluid or immunological barriers. Disruptions localized to the choroid plexus may initiate a range of
outcomes, including neuroinflammation, alterations in gray and white matter structural properties, or
neuropsychiatric manifestations including CD. The goal of this R21 is to characterize the biobehavioral basis of
CD in cSLE by cross-sectional interrogation of (i) prefrontal and parietal cortices with fNIRS and fMRI, (ii)
microstructural white matter properties using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), (iii) volumetric properties of the
choroid plexus using high-resolution structural MRI, (iv) neurometabolite (e.g., choline (Cho) and myo-inositol
(mIns)) concentrations using single-voxel MRS, (iv) cognitive function using the Pediatric Automated
Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (PedANAM) and supplementary cognitive tests (e.g., Digit span task)40,
41, and (v) psychiatric symptom (brief psychiatric rating scale [BPRS]42) and disease (SLE Disease Activity Index-
2K [SLEDAI-2K]43) severities. We will prospectively enroll 20 cSLE patients (12-18 years old, male or female)
and 20 age-sex matched healthy controls (HCs). To better understand the role of comorbid mood symptoms in
cSLE, we will also enroll 20 children with depressive or anxiety disorders. We will leverage existing structural
MRI datasets (30 cSLE patients + 30 matched HCs). Our hypothesis is that CD in cSLE is underpinned by a
combination of dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, altered white matter microstructure, and compromised
choroid plexus barrier function marked by morphological change. Understanding the biological basis and
behavioral outcomes of CD can improve recognition of neuropsychiatric cSLE and realign therapeutic strategies
with neurobiological phenotypes. We propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Investigate functional CNS
properties associated with CD in cSLE. Aim 2: Determine the associations among white matter microstructure
with severity of CD in cSLE. Aim 3: Quantify the choroid plexus volume in cSLE and its relationship with CD,
glial activity, and disease activity. To carry out this work, we assembled a team with complementary experience
in the treatment and investigation of cSLE, neuroscience, immunology, psychiatry, neuroradiology, and statistics."
10989052,"Proposal Abstract
 The yolk sac is an extra-embryonic organ that is vital for early embryo development, serving as the
nutrient supply center during the first trimester. It absorbs nutrients and synthesizes lipoproteins, which are
transported to the embryo through the vasculature and blood cells that are also produced by the yolk sac.
Accordingly, severe damage to the yolk sac by environmental insults, such as maternal infection, disease, and
chemical agent, leads to death or maldevelopment of the embryo. An example is diabetic embryopathy, in
which high levels of glucose impair the yolk sac to cause embryo abnormalities. However, our knowledge of
environmental factors that are harmful to the yolk sac is still scarce. More investigations on the yolk sac are
crucial to maintain healthy embryos. Since actual human yolk sac tissue is generally inaccessible, many
studies are conducted using animals, namely rodents, which have provided mechanistic insights into the yolk
sac formation. Notably, distinct differences exist between the yolk sacs of rodents and human, which
necessitate the establishment of human yolk sac models that are amenable to experimental interrogations.
The objective of the proposed project is to create an in vitro yolk sac model, or yolk sac organoid, using human
pluripotent stem cells, with the long-term goal of utilizing it to study the impact of harmful environmental factors.
We have recently developed a culture protocol, which allows aggregates of human pluripotent stem cells to
form large cysts surrounded by blood vessel-like structures. These cysts strongly express various transcripts
that are enriched in the human yolk sac. We hypothesize that these stem cell-derived cysts represent the
morphological and functional properties of the human yolk sac, and can serve as yolk sac organoids to be
used for further investigations. In Aim 1, we will characterize the stem cell-derived cyst at the cellular and
molecular levels to reveal which properties of the human yolk sac are captured. In Aim 2, we will test the roles
of key regulator genes in the yolk sac-like cyst formation to assess functional similarities between the rodent
and human yolk sacs. In Aim 3, we will examine the effects of high glucose levels on the yolk sac-like cyst
formation to provide insights into the mechanisms underlying diabetic embryopathy. The proposal is significant
because it aims to establish an experimentally tractable model of the human yolk sac. As the yolk sac is a vital
organ to support embryo development, understanding of its susceptibility to environmental disturbances is
crucial to ensure a healthy pregnancy. An in vitro model made of human pluripotent stem cells should be of
great value to facilitate investigations on the human yolk sac. The proposal is innovative because the creation
of an organoid that represents the human yolk sac at the morphological and functional level is highly unique,
and the idea of applying the yolk sac organoid to discover reproductively harmful factors is novel."
10998020,"Suicide is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and worldwide. The number of people who experience
suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is even larger. Although effective for treating suicidal behaviors,
traditional outpatient treatments for suicidality are time intensive. Given that the average number of
sessions attended by an individual is five, suicidal individuals are unlikely to receive an adequate dose of
these treatments. Additionally, there are too few mental health clinicians, and many providers are unwilling
to treat suicidal individuals. To address accessibility barriers, a number of brief suicide-specific
interventions have been developed. Brief interventions, including single sessions, reduce future suicidal
behavior and increase the likelihood of attending outpatient appointments. Extant treatments (both brief
and traditional) appear to have a limited impact on suicidal ideation. However, suicidal ideation as an
“upstream” target may have an impact on suicide attempts and deaths “downstream.” In line with NIMH’s
RDoC initiative, focusing on the core mechanisms that give rise to suicidal ideation may represent a more
potent and parsimonious approach to care. ‘Ideation-to-action’ theories outline specific mechanisms that
contribute to the onset and maintenance of STBs. These mechanistic theories point to a limited number of
potentially malleable processes (i.e., hopelessness, perceptions of social relatedness) that can become
the focus of intervention, yet this empirical literature has not been incorporated into treatment
development. The proposed study will compare a novel, mechanism-focused, Single Session Intervention
for STBs (SSI-STB) to treatment as usual (TAU) on an inpatient psychiatric unit. We aim to test whether
targeting the putative processes (hopelessness and negative perceptions of social relatedness) that
maintain STBs indeed engages those mechanisms and, consequently, prevents future STBs. The
applicant will also examine whether patients who receive the SSI-STB are more likely to attend their
follow-up mental health appointment relative to TAU. Participants admitted for suicidal ideation and/or
suicide attempt to the inpatient psychiatric unit will be randomized to the SSI-STB or TAU conditions,
receive the intervention that corresponds to their assigned condition, and will complete a post-intervention
self-report assessment directly after the intervention, and follow-up assessments at one week and one
month after discharge. Results will help us address the critical need of integrating established mechanisms
that maintain suicidality into a disseminable intervention for STBs. Moreover, this application describes an
excellent research environment for the proposed work, supported by a collaborative mentorship team with
relevant expertise. The applicant will learn new skills in mechanism-focused treatment development. This
clinical trial research experience will be invaluable toward the applicant’s goal of becoming an independent
physician/scientist."
10998022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine the effect of pharmacological, genetic, or activity -
based intervention to restore the neurogenic response to enriched environment (EE) in a mouse model of
prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). If successful, these studies may provide potential avenues of intervention for
hippocampal dysfunction associated with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The current proposal is
designed to test the overall hypothesis that increasing the survival of newborn neurons will reinstate the
neurogenic effect of enrichment in PAE mice. This proposal is premised on prior work demonstrating that
gestational exposure to moderate levels of alcohol have no effect on adult hippocampal neurogenesis when mice
are housed under standard conditions, but markedly impairs the ability of mice to mount a neurogenic response
to social and physical environmental enrichment. This impairment is not the result of reduced proliferation or size
of the progenitor pool, but results from impaired survival of newborn dentate granule cells (nDGCs) during the
activity-dependent stage of circuit integration. Using a well-characterized limited access voluntary drinking
paradigm, I will test our overarching hypothesis by addressing the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To
determine the therapeutic potential of fluoxetine (FLX) to restore EE-mediated neurogenesis in PAE mice.
For these studies, I will chronically administer the SSRI antidepressant, fluoxetine, (previously documented to
enhance the survival of nDGCs), during EE to determine its effects on the neurogenic response in PAE mice. In
addition, I will correlate the neurogenic response with behavioral assays of hippocampal function. Specific Aim
2: To determine the therapeutic potential of apoptotic inhibition, using inducible BAX knockout mice, to
restore EE-mediated neurogenesis in PAE mice. I will utilize a genetic approach to prolong the survival of
nDGCs in PAE-EE mice. Specifically, I will generate and characterize a triple transgenic mouse line,
NestinCreERT2:tdTomato:BAXf/f, to test whether selective deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene, BAX, within
hippocampal progenitors and their downstream progeny will facilitate EE-mediated neurogenesis in PAE mice.
Specific Aim 3: To determine the therapeutic potential of chemogenetic activation of nDGCs, to restore
EE-mediated neurogenesis in PAE mice. Here, I will utilize DREADD technology (designer receptors
exclusively activated by designer drugs) to selectively drive neuronal activity in nDGCs. Specifically, I plan to
generate and characterize a triple transgenic mouse line, NestinCreERT2:tdTomato:hM3Dq, and utilize the
DREADD agonist, deschloroclozapine (DCZ), to stimulate nDGCs in PAE-EE mice. These aims are in
accordance with the NIAAA’s mission to develop treatment strategies to address alcohol-related issues across
the lifespan. This proposed research also serves as an important framework for training in alcohol-related
neuroscience, utilizing state-of-the art approaches within the collaborative research environment of the New
Mexico Alcohol Research Center."
10998092,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Chronic low back pain (LBP) is extremely common worldwide yet poorly understood due to its multidimensional
complexity of biological, psychological, and sociological factors. Social determinants of health are non-medical
factors that influence health outcomes and can be measured partly by sociodemographic factors and social
health factors (i.e., social isolation, social participation, and social roles). An individual’s social factors may
interact with that individual’s biology during an acute LBP episode by influencing specific immune responses,
which may provide two pathways for interventions to prevent the development of chronic LBP. The goal of this
proposed project is to elucidate the relationship between social and biological factors’ influence on the transition
from acute to chronic LBP. To achieve this goal, we will use extant data on participants experiencing an episode
of acute LBP and determine if sociodemographic and social health factors influence the transition to chronic LBP
at three months. Then we will begin exploring the role of the immune system in this model by cross-sectionally
examining the association between social factors and the immune system during an acute episode of LBP. The
overall hypothesis of this proposal is that social factors are directly associated with the transition from acute
to chronic LBP and may influence biological pathways initiated during an acute episode of LBP. This
proposal will achieve the goals of the proposed study in three specific aims: first, by determining if race or racial
identity is associated with the transition from acute to chronic LBP; second, by determining if social health factors
are associated with the transition from acute to chronic LBP, as well as examining the potential moderating effect
of race on this relationship; third, by identifying the relationships between social factors and the immune system
during acute LBP. These aims will advance our knowledge of risk factors for developing chronic LBP. The
proposed work will have broad clinical implications for treating, managing, and/or preventing chronic LBP through
potential targeted treatments of social health risk factors (i.e., isolation, roles, or participation) or potential
immunotherapy treatments for sub-groups (i.e., race) at high risk for transition to chronic LBP."
10997877,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Violence is a widespread public health problem, yet sexual and gender diverse (SGD) populations are
disproportionately impacted by multiple forms of violence, affecting feelings of safety and contributing to physical,
mental, and behavioral health disparities. SGD populations also experience disparities in poverty rates and
financial security as a result of structural vulnerability in employment, education, and wages. Strengthening
financial security is a promising violence prevention strategy that has not been examined for SGD populations.
This study will improve insights into financial security as a determinant of violence and safety and evaluate the
role of policy in shaping SGD violence disparities, informing the utility of violence prevention strategies promoting
financial security for SGD populations. To accomplish this, specific aims are to: 1) Examine the association
between household income and violence victimization rates and assess moderating effects of sexual and gender
identity; 2) Explore the role of financial security in feelings of safety; and 3) Evaluate state Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) expansions for their impact on SGD violence rates.
Aim 1 will utilize linear mixed effects models to assess the relationship between household income and violent
victimization rates by sexual and gender identity in a secondary analysis of National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS) data from 2017-2023. Aim 2 will leverage the data and infrastructure of an existing study conducting
lifeline interviews with 60 transgender, nonbinary, and gender diverse people in Baltimore City to qualitatively
explore the relationship between financial security and feelings of safety. Aim 3 will apply innovative policy
evaluation methods, including comparative interrupted time series designs and synthetic control modeling, to
examine the impact of state EITC expansions and state-level violent victimization rates among SGD populations
in 22 states using NCVS data. This multi-method study uniquely combines an in-depth exploration of financial
security as a mechanism by which societal factors lead to violence disparities with the investigation of an
actionable policy approach to advance health disparities science. This research will contribute to the evidence
base for upstream prevention strategies concerned with redistributing social and structural determinants of health
to alleviate disparities and promote SGD safety and well-being.
The proposed research will fulfill the dissertation and degree requirements for Ms. Kennedy, PhD student at the
Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The training will be mentored by experts in SGD health
equity, policy evaluation, social science methods, and translational science with one Sponsor, one Co-sponsor,
and two Collaborators. The training plan outlines didactic coursework, trainings, and workshops, experiential
learning via research assistantships, mentored dissertation study, and other advanced training opportunities to
prepare Ms. Kennedy to meet her career goal of becoming a leading health equity researcher and advocate in
violence prevention for SGD populations."
10997930,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci) are Gram-positive cocci that usually exists as a commensal of the
human nasopharyngeal mucosa but are often characterized as pathogens due to its ability to disseminate from
the nasopharynx and into the inner ear and lower respiratory tract. High bacterial load during lower respiratory
tract infection, such as bronchitis and pneumonia, restricts the efficacy of the mucociliary escalator, leading to
inflammation and limited gas exchange. Mucus serves as a protective barrier between the lung epithelium and
the environment and a nutritional source for the pneumococcus. We found that mucin serves as a key nutritional
cue for S. pneumoniae, preventing autolysis and facilitating prolonged bacterial survival in stationary phase
compared to traditional media. Since mucin is abundant in pneumococcal environmental niches, we wanted to
assess the impact of mucin on various aspects pneumococcal biology. We found that mucin effectively blocked
pneumococcal autolysis via inhibition of the primary autolysin, LytA. A fundamental aspect of pneumococcal
biology is the capacity of the bacterium to rapidly undergo autolysis following entry into stationary phase during
standard in vitro cultivation leading to a rapid loss in culture viability. We observed that mucin-mediated autolysis
inhibition not only prevented this process but also promoted long-term stationary phase survival of the
pneumococcus both planktonically and in biofilms. This phenotype was highly conserved amongst genetically
diverse strain backgrounds and independent of capsular serotype. The mucin-mediated autolysis inhibition was
found to be dependent upon the direct inhibitory activity of physiological concentrations mucin on LytA using
peptidoglycan hydrolysis assays. Additionally, mice that over produce mucus were found to have enhanced
pneumococcal nasal colonization. Based on these preliminary findings, we aim to determine 1) the specificity
underlying mucin-mediated autolysis inhibition; 2) the impact of mucin-mediated autolysis inhibition on
pneumococcal evolutionary tools such cytotoxicity; and 3) the genetic determinants that are required for
prolonged stationary phase survival in mucin. Environmental context is critical to understanding the fundamental
biology of pathogens. The primary host niche for the pneumococcus is the nasopharynx, which is replete with
mucins. These data suggest that environmental niches harboring mucins may promote pneumococcal
colonization over invasive infection by preventing host cell death and prolonged bacterial survival."

 PROJECT SUMMARY
 Biomolecular cues that mediate homeostasis are not fully elucidated. During the most recent
funding cycle, AR043799 found that intracellular glucose increases during differentiation of diverse
cell types where it controls multimerization of nucleic acid binding proteins, independent of its role in
energetics. This new role for glucose is analogous to action as a second messenger. In epidermis,
glucose directly bound specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs), including DDX21, as well as specific
DNA binding protein (DBP) transcription factors (TFs), including IRF6, to alter their dimerization in
ways essential for differentiation. To understand principles of glucose action in homeostasis, this
competing renewal will define the function of glucose binding to additional RBPs and TFs.
 For RBPs, we found that DEAD-box DDX RBPs were among the most enriched glucose binding
proteins essential for epidermal differentiation. Glucose binding dissociated DDX21 dimers,
propelling DDX21 monomers out of the nucleolar rRNA production machinery into nuclear
complexes controlling splicing of essential pro-differentiation mRNAs. In contrast, glucose binding
altered DDX50 association with an entirely different set of interactors and had no effect on RNA
splicing, indicating that glucose binding engages a diversity of pro-differentiation mechanisms for
specific DDX RBPs. Aim I will characterize glucose-enabled DDX50 pro-differentiation functions as
well as the impacts of glucose binding on the subcellular localization, protein interactions, RNA
interactions, mRNA splicing, and RNA-dependent protein assemblies of 3 other glucose-binding
RNA helicases essential for epidermal homeostasis, namely DDX1, DDX17, and DDX18.
 For TFs, we found that glucose binding to IRF6 – in contrast to its dissociating effects on both
DDX21 and DDX50 RBP dimers - induced IRF6 homodimerization, along with IRF6 DNA binding,
genomic targeting, and differentiation gene transcription. This raised the question as to how glucose
impacts other glucose-binding TFs essential for epidermal homeostasis. Among the latter is the pro-
differentiation TF, TFAP2A, which binds DNA as a dimer with other AP-2 subunits. Aim II will
characterize the effects of glucose binding on TFAP2A dimerization and target gene induction.
Epidermal differentiation is enabled by other known factors, including calcium, specific adhesion
proteins, and dominant differentiation-driving TFs. Aim II will therefore also determine the interplay
between physiologic elevation of intracellular glucose and differentiation enabled by representative
important contextual factors in epidermal cells.
 This effort will define the function of glucose-binding regulators in epidermal differentiation to
expand insight into the mechanistic actions of newly identified biomolecular cues in homeostasis."

 Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a pathobiont that causes dangerous infections during pregnancy and in
the neonatal period. The goal of our proposed project is to determine molecular mechanisms that cause fetal
injury, preterm labor, and stillbirth during GBS intraamniotic infection. The scientific premise of our work stems
from the fact that GBS is a common and asymptomatic commensal member of the intestinal microbiota in up to
30% of healthy adults, yet when GBS transits to the intraamniotic space it demonstrates host cell invasiveness,
cytotoxicity, and pro-inflammatory characteristics that can be catastrophic to pregnancy viability. We
hypothesize that significant drops in micronutrient availability that occur when GBS moves from its colonizing
niche in the intestine and vagina into the nutritionally austere environment of amniotic fluid activate cellular
stress responses that promote expression of virulence factors and drive adverse pregnancy outcomes. This
nutritional virulence hypothesis is supported by multiple studies published by our group, which point to small
molecule byproducts of nucleotide synthesis pathways—upregulated during host invasion—as molecular
mediators of the GBS phenotypic shift from commensal to virulent in amniotic fluid. Our own preliminary data
are further supported by evidence from other, independent laboratories, whose findings conform to a model of
shifting bacterial metabolism as a signaling event that promotes GBS virulence. Our multi-institutional, multi-
disciplinary consortium will deploy a unique set of experimental capabilities to examine how environmental
growth conditions interact with genetically encoded stress responses to produce distinct metabolomic profiles
in GBS. Through three specific aims, we will 1) determine the impact of the GBS metabolome on expression of
known virulence factor pathways; 2) evaluate how altering the GBS metabolome affects its propensity to
invade and inflame human fetal membranes; 3) use direct intraamniotic injection in a mouse model of
gestational GBS infection to assess in vivo the impact of altered GBS metabolic states and signaling molecule
production on clinically relevant pregnancy outcomes of fetal demise and preterm delivery. These studies will
establish a new paradigm for understanding a consequential infectious cause of pregnancy loss worldwide,
generating translatable insights into mechanisms of intraamniotic infection by GBS."

Mitochondria uptake Ca2+ via the uniporter, a Ca2+-activated Ca2+ channel within the inner membrane. The
uniporter comprises the pore-forming subunit MCU, its paralog MCUb, a metazoan-specific regulator EMRE,
and the EF-hand Ca2+-sensing proteins MICU1-3. Calcium stimulates mitochondrial ATP production by
upregulating the TCA cycle dehydrogenases. However, excessive Ca2+ uptake can lead to the activation of
apoptotic pathways. Hence the processes involved in mitochondrial calcium uptake and efflux, cumulatively
referred to as the calcium cycle, must be precisely regulated. Recent studies have documented a broad spectrum
of pathologies associated with impaired mitochondrial calcium cycle. The recessive loss of function mutations in
MICU1 underlie an unusual metabolic myopathy and fatigue. Impaired uniporter function is a likely cause of
cardiac and skeletal myopathies associated with Barth syndrome. Common single nucleotide polymorphism in
MCU and MCUb is associated with cardiometabolic traits. MCU and MCUb expression is elevated in various
forms of muscular dystrophy, while ablation of MCUb in macrophages leads to impaired skeletal muscle
regeneration. A comprehensive understanding of the uniporter function and its role in a broad context of the
mitochondrial calcium cycle is essential in specific muscle diseases, inflammation, and innate immunity. Hence,
we plan to: (1) Reconstitute the mammalian Ca2+ uniporter holocomplex in proteoliposomes. A fully
functional in vitro reconstitution system will allow detailed structure-function studies of Ca2+ transport and
regulation of mammalian holocomplex, understand specific regulation by MICU1 splice variants such as
MICU1.1, a muscle-specific isoform, and verify candidate chemical inhibitors that we have identified. (2)
Characterize the function of MCUb, the paralog of MCU. The current dogma in the field is that MCUb is a
non-conducting subunit of the uniporter that can exert dominant-negative activity. Our preliminary studies
indicate an alternative possibility, which we will explore using both genetic loss of function studies, biochemistry,
and functional reconstitution. (3) Define the mitochondrial calcium cycle. We have devised a high-throughput,
pooled genetic screening technology called permeabilized-cell mitochondrial function sequencing (PMF-seq) to
identify genes whose ablation positively or negatively impacts mitochondrial voltage response to Ca2+. We will
now perform follow-up experiments on selected new genes we identified and perform additional sensitized
genetic screens on the genetic knockout and chemical inhibitor backgrounds. These studies will yield a complete
and detailed map of interdependencies between mitochondrial calcium cycle genes and their effectors."

In this project, we study the mortality experience of the U.S. foreign-born population in unprecedented detail
leveraging innovative individual-level data linkages between census and Social Security records that contain
data on over 5 million foreign-born persons. Between 2000 and 2020, the foreign-born population of the U.S.
grew by 42% reaching 44 million individuals in 2020. The population has become increasingly diverse by birth
country and race/ethnicity. Despite the recent and projected growth and increasing diversity of the foreign born,
available data to study their mortality have been limited. We do not know the full extent to which foreign-born
subgroups are experiencing differing levels of healthy/unhealthy assimilation and how factors such as birth
country, age at migration, economic mobility, and race/ethnicity are associated with their mortality.
 Our proposed project is designed to overcome the challenges faced by previous research by: (1) including a
large sample of the foreign born permitting detailed analyses by country and world region of birth and by
race/ethnicity; (2) avoiding the numerator/denominator bias that is present when using vital statistics data and
census records; (3) capturing deaths occurring outside of the U.S., which avoids “statistical immortality”; and (4)
including the role of earnings trajectories as well as other markers of integration (age at migration, duration of
U.S. residence, type of education, citizenship, language ability, and household characteristics) to understand
key life-cycle determinants of foreign-born mortality, (5) measuring the contribution the foreign born to widening
geographic inequalities in U.S. mortality, and (6) measuring the role of internal migration on mortality.
 We will construct a unique individual-level database from census records linked to longitudinal information on
death records, earnings, and U.S. place of residence. Aim 1 will provide the first set of country and world region-
specific life expectancies for the foreign born across all major sending countries. We test the roles of birth
country-specific, migration-related, and post-migration factors on mortality. Aim 2 tests the role of earnings
trajectories on mortality by country/world region of birth. We test whether downward (upward) earnings
trajectories are associated with higher (lower) mortality, thereby providing novel evidence on healthy and
unhealthy assimilation. We develop a detailed portrait of immigrant earnings trajectories for all major foreign-
born subpopulations. Aim 3 identifies the foreign-born contributions to widening geographic inequalities in U.S.
mortality by race/ethnicity. We further estimate the role of internal migration on foreign-born and U.S.-born
mortality and compare the mortality of U.S.-born internal migrants to foreign-born movers and non-movers by
race/ethnicity. Given the uniquely large sample of foreign-born persons and the rich longitudinal structure of
these data, this project will provide the most comprehensive study of U.S. foreign-born mortality to date
contributing to knowledge about the key social, migration, and economic factors that shape foreign-born health
as they incorporate into American society."
10980286,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hazardous alcohol consumption remains a significant public health issue among U.S. young adults aged 18 to
25. While interventions exist for college students, non-collegiate young adults, who constitute 38% of this
demographic, are underserved. Text messaging, with its extensive reach and asynchronous communication,
emerges as a promising intervention medium. While existing text-based interventions have shown efficacy,
there's potential for enhancement by addressing influential environmental factors. Our solution, ASPIRE
(Accountability Support through Peer-Inspired Relationships and Engagement), guided by the Social Cognitive
Theory, integrates environmental factors alongside traditional cognitive and behavioral elements. A pilot trial with
non-collegiate participants from 31 US states revealed promising results: a significant reduction in binge drinking
days and related consequences after three months of exposure to ASPIRE. Our next step involves a comparative
study of ASPIRE against a Cognitive Behavioral Intervention (CBI). In a proposed assessor-blind, randomized
trial, participants will be allocated to either CBI or ASPIRE for three months. Bi-weekly text assessments will
measure drinking patterns and peer interactions. While both groups will receive regular feedback, the ASPIRE
group will gain additional support targeting positive peer influences and strategies to modify their physical
environment. Outcomes, measured using online surveys at multiple intervals, will gauge alcohol consumption
and its associated negative consequences. Additionally, GPS data will be collected periodically to analyze
patterns, such as time spent at drinking locations. Three primary objectives guide this research: 1. Assessing
ASPIRE's effectiveness in reducing hazardous alcohol consumption compared to CBI. 2.Deciphering the
mechanisms underpinning behavior change, focusing on the role of peer influence and physical environment. 3.
Identifying which subgroups benefit most from ASPIRE to enable more tailored interventions in the future. This
research aligns with NIH's priorities, especially NIAAA's strategic plans, emphasizing a broader scope of
research and evaluating innovative behavioral interventions for non-collegiate young adults."
10980431,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating X-linked disease with no current cure. DMD is
caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin. Dystrophin is a protein necessary for the maintenance of
muscle structure and is essential for skeletal and cardiac muscle integrity. As muscle damage progresses, the
respiratory muscles become weak and fibrotic leading to hypoventilation and respiratory insufficiency. Sadly,
most patients die from respiratory failure. Further, 1/3 of DMD patients also have neurological manifestations
and central nervous system (CNS) pathology. However, the impact of the CNS pathology in the respiratory-
related morbidity in DMD is unknown. Defining the respiratory muscle and neuropathology is essential as novel
gene therapies using AAV-microdystrophin (AAV-µDys) for DMD enter clinical trials and become FDA-approved.
Several pre-clinical trials with AAV-μDys reveal promising results with dystrophin production resulting in
improved survival and ambulation; however, in these studies the diaphragm was not adequately transduced, and
respiratory outcome was not assessed. Thus, there remains a critical need for a therapy that will halt or reverse
respiratory disease. In our first aim, we will comprehensively examine breathing and the respiratory motor units
in novel humanized mouse models and compare these to the established mdx DMD mouse model. We will then
utilize these DMD mouse models to elucidate the impact of dystrophin deficiency on respiratory neuro-pathology.
Finally, we will examine the efficacy of a novel AAV capsid carrying μDys in treating respiratory pathology and
neuro-pathology in the DMD mouse models. The fundamental hypothesis driving this proposal is that
dystrophin deficiency in both the respiratory muscles and CNS leads to breathing impairments, and
AAV-μDys will correct both the respiratory myopathy and neuropathology. In Aim 1 we will identify the
impact of dystrophin deficiency on respiratory function and histopathology in the humanized mouse models of
DMD. In Aim 2, we will perform physiological, histological, transcriptional, and molecular studies to define the
impact of dystrophin loss on the respiratory centers and motor neurons of the medulla and cervical spinal cord.
Then, we will examine the ability of a novel AAVcc47-µDys to effectively transduce and correct respiratory
muscle and neuro-pathology (Aim 3). The proposed experiments are innovative because the impact of
dystrophin deficiency on breathing and neuropathology in humanized mouse models has not been previously
examined. Defining this pathology will provide clinically relevant outcome measures for future therapeutic
studies. Finally, the use of the novel AAVcc47 to deliver µDys and target respiratory pathophysiology and
neuropathology will provide a much needed therapeutic option for respiratory insufficiency in DMD. Since AAV-
µDys gene therapy is already in clinical trials, this work has the strong potential to quickly translate to clinic and
inform and impact the clinical treatment of boys and young men with DMD."

The goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanism(s) by which programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) reverse
or intracellular signaling acts as an immune regulator in the liver during both acute infection, chronic infection
and chronic disease. Our studies have outlined a major role for PD-L1 reverse signaling in the control of dendritic
cell (DC) migration, DC activation and in regulating T cell cytokine production. These findings are consistent with
PD-L1 acting to mitigate type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling events. Using a murine model where just three amino
acids in the cytoplasmic domain of PD-L1 are mutated to alanine, to limit reverse signaling, we find increased
fibrosis in a murine model of Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and decreased liver
pathology in an acute systemic listeria infection model. Therefore, in this proposal we aim to better understand
the different functions of PD-L1 reverse signaling (ie, DC migration vs activation) and how they contribute to T
cell programming in listeria infection and MASH. We also aim to better understand which PD-L1 expressing cells
in the liver contribute to effector T cell responses and liver fibrosis in the absence of PD-L1 reverse signaling
using a murine model of MASH. Finally, we aim to address the importance of PD-L1 reverse signaling in the liver
in the setting of acute versus chronic infection of LCMV. Together these Aims will define how a widely targeted
immune regulatory molecule, PD-L1, functions in the liver through intracellular signaling events not previously
recognized or appreciated."
10995551,"Abstract: Novel inner ear organoid models for studying hair cells in normal development and in the deaf-
blindness disease Usher Syndrome Type 1F
The fundamental human sense of balance, which comprises both movement through the world and one’s body
position in space, begins with specialized biological detectors called “hair cells” responsible for converting
mechanical stimuli into electrical signals (also known as mechanotransduction). Hair cells perform this function
by converting mechanical stimuli on their apical surface (received by a specialized structure of actin-rich
stereocilia) into electrical impulses on their basolateral surface (produced by specialized ribbon synapses).
Despite their critical role and decades of study in animal models, many aspects of the hallmarks of hair cell
development specifically in developing human tissue have yet to be explored. To circumvent the difficulty in
access, collection, and preservation of in vivo or ex vivo human tissue, human induced pluripotent stem cell
(hiPSC) derived inner ear organoids (IEOs) have emerged as a new model for studying human development.
IEOs are 3D aggregates of cells containing many internal vesicles lined with inner ear sensory epithelia and
synapsing neurons. Strong histologic and limited transcriptomic data of IEOs show that the in vitro organoids
recapitulate many of the diverse features found in the in vivo inner ear. Unfortunately, the sensory cells of interest
are buried by a large population of supporting and mesenchymal cells, preventing their long-term developmental
and functional study. My recent work in the lab has shown that perturbation of extracellular matrix proteins
reverses the polarity of the sensory epithelia such that the progenitor epithelia remain on the surface and have
their apical surfaces pointed outwards into the media. The outwardly facing hair cells with this new method are
now both accessible and imageable, overcoming the limitations of previous IEO versions. Based on initial
characterization, I hypothesize that inverted apical-out IEOs yield more numerous and more functionally mature
hair cells. In Aim 1, I will characterize the genetic and physiologic properties of the human hair cell population
that is now accessible through our in vitro model. I will perform single cell RNA sequencing in the mature organoid
and bathe the organoids in artificial solutions that mimic in vivo endolymph to attempt to mature the transcriptomic
and electrophysiological profiles of the hair cells. In Aim 2, I will use a patient-derived hiPSC line from a patient
with a devastating genetic deaf-blindness mutation known as USH1F to investigate the development of critical
apical structures and the disrupted effects that damage hair cell function. I will then attempt to use viral-mediated
gene therapies before the onset of hair cell dysfunction to restore proper hair cell development. These
experiments will reveal the first generation of many applications of this new approach to generate apical-out
inner ear organoids in order to study human development, disease progression, and as a platform to develop
novel therapeutics."

 The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnant women living with HIV is an effective way to prevent
mother-to-child transmission. However, HIV-exposed, but uninfected (HEU) children experience higher mortality
from common infections and severe respiratory disease. However, the independent and combinatorial effects of
HIV and ART on fetal immune cell development remain unknown. We propose to utilize the well-established
rhesus macaque model of ART-treated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection to test our hypothesis that
maternal SIV and ART exert differential effects on the development and maturation of the fetal immune
system, resulting in dysregulated functional responses. To address the differential effects of suppressed
SIV infection and ART, we will study three experimental groups of females. In the SIV/ART group, females will
be infected with SIV and then suppressed with ART before undergoing timed-mated breeding. We will have two
control groups: an ART-only group and an untreated/uninfected healthy pregnancy group. We acknowledge that
the ART-only group is not a clinically relevant scenario, but necessary in the context of the proposed studies to
distinguish the contribution of ART per se to the fetal immune phenotype exhibited by the offspring of SIV/ART
dams. We do not have an untreated SIV-infected group, as this is not relevant to the vast majority of pregnant
WLWH. GD130-135 fetuses will be obtained via Caesarean section and studied as outlined in the following
Specific Aims. Aim 1. Determine the effects of maternal SIV/ART or ART on fetal immune system function.
HEU children exhibit altered lymphocyte function and blunted responses of monocytes to pathogens. However,
little is known about the effects of HIV/ART and ART exposure on lymphoid and myeloid cell activation during
fetal development. Therefore, we will study the effects of SIV/ART or ART on both the innate and adaptive arms
of the fetal immune system in circulation and in fetal tissues using a combination of flow cytometry, functional
assays, and single-cell transcriptomics. Aim 2. Determine the effects of maternal SIV/ART or ART on fetal
hematopoiesis. SIV/ART or ART may impact fetal immune system development by altering fetal hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Therefore, in this aim, we will isolate HSPCs from the fetal liver and fetal
bones and determine the transcriptional landscape and functional reconstitution abilities of HSPCs from
SIV/ART, ART alone, and control fetuses. Given the increasingly prevalent use of ART in women of reproductive
age, this study will further our understanding of the effect of ART on fetal immune development. The ultimate
goal of the proposed studies is to identify fetal immune system developmental pathways that can be targeted by
therapeutics and interventions to improve immune outcomes for this vulnerable population of infants."

Black women are disproportionately impacted by HIV accounting, for 54% of new infections while constituting
only 13% of women in the US in 2019. These disparities are even more prevalent in the South. Pre-exposure
prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective biomedical preventive measure for HIV. PrEP is available in both oral and
injectable formulations, providing options for enhancing PrEP uptake and persistence. However, PrEP is
underutilized among women, with only 10% of eligible women being prescribed PrEP in 2019. In the South,
historical racism, gender-based discrimination, and the absence of integrated family planning and
prevention-oriented sexual healthcare combine to contribute to low PrEP use Black women. Such
factors include: limited PrEP awareness, low perceived risk of acquiring HIV, HIV-related stigma and
discrimination, concerns about side effects, costs, limited marketing to Black women, medical mistrust, and
limited availability and access to PrEP. Further, systemic racism, sexism and classism, race-based
stereotypes, gendered social norms, and microaggression may render Black women less empowered to make
decisions on their sexual health. Given the complex interplay of HIV-related stigma, racism and
discrimination experienced by Black women, a holistic approach encompassing PrEP education,
enhancing access, building resilience, and sexual empowerment has the potential to facilitate PrEP
deliberation, decision-making, uptake, and persistence.
Although Black women are at higher risk for HIV, limited interventions are available to optimize PrEP uptake
and persistence among this population. This study aims to address this by developing and pilot testing the
telehealth intervention EMPOWER (Enhancing and Motivating PrEP Options among Women through
Empowerment and Resilience). The study aims include: Aim 1. Assess the sexual health and PrEP-
related values, preferences, perceptions and needs of Black women to inform development of the
EMPOWER intervention. Guided by a conceptual framework of intersecting racial and gender-based
discrimination theories (Theory of Gender and Power and the Minority Stress Model), in-depth interviews will
be conducted with 20 Black women and 20 healthcare providers. Aim 2. Refine the EMPOWER intervention
and online platform for improving PrEP decision-making among Black women. An open trial with 20
Black women will be used to evaluate and refine intervention content and delivery, interventionist training and
supervision, fidelity rating, and study assessment procedures. Aim 3. Conduct a waitlist-controlled,
randomized pilot trial of the 6-session group intervention using a cross-over design with 80 Black
women. We will assess the intervention’s feasibility and acceptability. Clinical outcomes will be PrEP uptake
and persistence measured by Tenofovir Diphosphate (TDV-DP) concentrations in dried blood spot at baseline,
3- and 6-months post-intervention compared with standard of care (opt-out PrEP) at the intervention site."

Imagine having to choose between an apple or an orange for a snack. To decide between these famously
incomparable options, you may think back to previous experiences you have had with either fruit and choose the
one you enjoyed the most. To make a choice in this manner, it is crucial that you remember your previous snacks
with a relatively high level of detail, specifically when it comes to the identity of the fruit. Conversely, imagine a
decision-maker who is asked to choose between two novel options: a new brand of chocolate, and a fruit they
have never tasted before. In this case, choosing the right snack relies on abstracting over the details of past
experiences to infer the high-level value of chocolate versus fruit – the specifics of each experience are no longer
relevant. Thus, less precise memory can facilitate the generalization of value to novel exemplars of a particular
kind, while hindering people’s ability to choose between similar options. Here, we propose to test this hypothesis
by leveraging the decreases in memory precision that occur naturally in healthy aging. We will collect fMRI data
while participants take part in two variants of a decision task that relies on estimating value from past experience
in service of choice. In Aim 1, participants will choose between items that are semantically and perceptually
similar, meaning that precise memory is necessary for accurate choice. We predict that older adults will perform
poorly at this task because of decreases in the precision with which they can remember stimulus identities.
Furthermore, we predict that decreased pattern separation in the posterior hippocampus – a phenomenon by
which similar items are kept separate in memory via enhanced neural differentiation – will be at the root of this
effect. In Aim 2, participants will be asked to make choices between novel exemplars of specific categories
whose value they can learn over time. We hypothesize that older adults, because of this same decrease in
memory precision, will actually generalize category value faster than their younger counterparts, who may be
more biased by noise from individual exemplars. Neurally, we expect to find greater pattern completion (the
opposite of pattern separation) in the hippocampus of older adults, as well as increased connectivity between
the hippocampus and other brain regions known to track category information (ex: medial prefrontal cortex). We
will also characterize these effects computationally by comparing the performance of an “object only”
reinforcement learning (RL) model in which each exemplar is assigned a separate value to a model that
understands categories by separating them into discrete states towards which value can be assigned."

Project Summary
 Replication stress often occurs when DNA replication is disrupted, leading to DNA double-strand
break (DSB) formation. Replication stress can also be triggered by oncogene expression and is
associated with tumor development. Notably, replication stress creates vulnerabilities in cancer cells that
can be exploited for cancer treatment. Nevertheless, our understanding of the detailed DNA repair
mechanisms upon fork breakage due to replication stress, as well as our capacity to effectively target the
associated vulnerabilities for cancer treatment, remains limited.
 DNA polymerase θ (POLQ) is a specialized DNA polymerase critical for DSB repair, and
compromised POLQ function leads to genomic instability and radiation sensitivity. Substantial evidence
suggests that POLQ plays an important role in microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Given the
prevalence of microhomologies at cancer breakpoints, POLQ-mediated MMEJ is thought to be involved
in promoting genome instability associated with cancer, but the precise underlying mechanism remains
unclear. In this study, we discovered a unique role of POLQ in repair of DSBs linked to fork breakage,
revealing a new mechanism that requires POLQ to cope with replication stress.
 Based on the role of POLQ in repair of damaged forks, we found that inhibiting POLQ leads to
cell death under replication stress, and this effect is significantly intensified when ATR is inhibited. We
propose that combined therapeutic strategy utilizing POLQ inhibitors and ATR inhibitors would
synergistically eradicate cancer cells experiencing high replication stress. Given the current proposed
use of POLQ inhibitors is primarily for treating BRCA-deficient tumors, this study will substantially
broaden the application of POLQ inhibitors.
 We hypothesize that the role of POLQ in repairing broken forks forms the basis for treating
replication-stressed cancer cells with POLQ inhibitors and ATR inhibitors, and propose to investigate the
mechanism behind POLQ-mediated MMEJ in repair of broken forks. We will examine how POLQ is
engaged to repair replication-associated DSBs and study the collaborative functions of POLQ-mediated
MMEJ and break-induced replication (BIR) in repairing broken forks. We will use cell-based assay and
xenograft mouse model to explore cancer therapeutic strategy of using POLQ inhibitors and ATR
inhibitors. This study will not only shed light on the role of POLQ-mediated MMEJ in coping with
replication stress, but will also lay the groundwork for potential cancer treatments by targeting cancer
vulnerabilities associated with replication stress. Since replication stress is highly associated with cancer,
this study will additionally bring insights into the DNA repair mechanisms that modulate genome integrity
during tumor development."
10996852,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The recent successes of checkpoint blockade therapies have highlighted the potential of immunotherapy for
cancer treatment. Still, only about 30% of treatment recipients experience long term tumor regression. Thus,
understanding the mechanisms that drive therapy resistance is essential for improving patient
outcomes. We now understand that the efficacy of immunotherapy depends on the presence and persistence
of functional immune cells within the tumor. Tumor-specific CD8 T cells are activated by tumor antigens and
directly kill tumor cells. However, tumor infiltrating CD8 T cells encounter chronic antigen stimulation and a host
of environmental stressors (e.g hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, etc) that suppress their function. This suppressive
tumor microenvironment ultimately induces an altered CD8 T cell differentiation state called exhaustion,
characterized by reduced effector function, immune inhibitory receptor expression, and a distinct epigenetic and
transcriptional program. Our lab and others have demonstrated that the suppressive microenvironment drives
mitochondrial stress and altered metabolism, which promotes CD8 T cell exhaustion. While we understand that
mitochondrial insufficiency is a driver of CD8 T cell exhaustion, the mechanisms that underly this connection
remain understudied. Interestingly, CD8 T cells accumulate lipids and repress lipolysis as they differentiate
towards an exhausted state. In this study, we aim to understand the impact of increased lipid accumulation on
CD8 T cell differentiation and function. Citrate transported from the mitochondria is converted to acetyl-CoA in
the cytosol, where it acts as a substrate for de novo lipogenesis. Thus, citrate transport connects mitochondrial
metabolism to cytosolic lipid synthesis and accumulation. Preliminary data show that in vitro inhibition of the
mitochondrial citrate transporter (SLC25A1) preserves effector function in chronically stimulated T cells and
reduces lipid content. These data suggest that as exhausted CD8 T cells may reprogram their metabolism to
shuttle citrate from dysfunctional mitochondria, resulting in increased de novo lipogenesis and lipid accumulation
in the cytosol. Thus, we hypothesize that chronically stimulated CD8 T cells inappropriately store
mitochondrial citrate as lipids, which inhibits effector function and promotes differentiation to an
exhausted state. We will test this hypothesis by (1) evaluating the impact of abolishing citrate transport on
carbon utilization and effector function of CD8 T cells within the tumor microenvironment and (2) determining the
role of stored lipids in CD8 T cell function. The insights gained by these studies will help us understand whether
accumulated lipids represent ‘dead weight’ in exhausted CD8 T cells, or whether accumulated lipids represent
an untapped source of fuel that may be the key to their reinvigoration."
10996727,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer associated fibroblasts and pancreatic stellate cells (PSC/CAF) and abnormal tumor blood vessels are
two major factors that contribute to treatment failure. PSC/CAF contribute to the collagen-rich extracellular matrix
(ECM) which impairs drug delivery, promotes cancer cell survival and contributes to an immunosuppressive
environment. CAF have been shown to have a similar role in supporting metastatic sites of disease in
PDAC. Currently, no agent is available that can simultaneously selectively reduce activated PSC/CAF and
normalize angiogenesis. Both activated PSC/CAF and angiogenic endothelial cells selectively express high
levels of integrin v3. There is no expression of integrin v3 in normal tissue. We developed ProAgio, an
innovative protein drug with a distinct mechanism of action from currently available integrin-targeting agents in
targeting integrin v3 at a novel non-ligand binding site. ProAgio induces apoptosis of integrin v3
expressing PSC/CAF and angiogenic endothelial cells with a high efficiency by recruiting and activating
caspase-8 at the cytoplasmic domain of. Our preliminary data shows ProAgio has anti-tumor activity in
multiple PDAC models and enhances the effect of gemcitabine. Histologic analyses showed ProAgio decreased
collagen and depleted PSC/CAF in tumors. In a phase I clinical trial, single agent ProAgio has demonstrated
excellent safety profile, promising pharmacokinetic profile and anti-tumor activity in patients with PDAC.
We hypothesize that, by inducing apoptosis of integrin v3 expressing cells, ProAgio will specifically deplete
both angiogenic endothelial cells and activated PSC/CAF leading to inhibition of collagen deposition in PDAC
tumors, which will enhance drug delivery and increase the sensitivity of PDAC to established therapies. This
Project has three Specific Aims: 1) To characterize the toxicity and determine the recommended phase II dose
of ProAgio in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. We will conduct a phase I clinical trial of ProAgio
in metastatic PDAC patients with no prior therapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The goal is to determine
the recommended phase II dose, evaluate pharmacokinetics of ProAgio, and characterize toxicity. A secondary
objective is to obtain preliminary activity data (overall response rate) for ProAgio with gemcitabine and nab-
paclitaxel in PDAC. 2) To analyze the effect of ProAgio in patient tumors and validate the mechanism of drug
action. PDAC patients enrolled in the expansion phase will undergo paired pre- and post-treatment biopsies. We
will validate mechanism of ProAgio action by assessing changes in intratumoral collagen, blood vessels,
PSC/CAF subtypes, immune cells, and αvβ3 expression in these patient samples. Samples will be analyzed via
multiplex immunofluorescence with spatial quantification and single cell RNA sequencing. 3) To evaluate the
pharmacodynamics effects of ProAgio on angiogenesis and tumor perfusion. The perfusion changes in tumors
after treatment with ProAgio plus chemotherapy will be measured using quantitative DCE-MRI in all patients."

The goal of this proposal is to dissect the distinct molecular roles of Polycomb Repressive
Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1&PRC2) and upstream factors in establishing silencing at
developmentally regulated genes. The PRCs are conserved chromatin modifiers that represses
transcription via chemical and structural alterations of chromatin architecture. PRC1 mutations
cause neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disabilities,
and dysmorphic body features, while mutations in PRC2 are the main cause of Weaver
syndrome making it crucial to gain understanding about polycomb repression during early
development. Despite ubiquitous expression, PRC1 and PRC2 can target distinct sets of genes
for silencing in different cell lineages, resulting in cell-type specific expression. Though there are
decades of research on Polycomb protein function, a key unanswered question is how
polycomb repressive complexes select different target genes as cells differentiate into different
cell types. While we understand the interplay of PRC1 and PRC2 during the maintenance of
polycomb silencing, we do not understand the order of events in the establishment of new
polycomb domains at de novo silenced genes.
Others in the field have shown that correct PRC2 localization can be re-established de novo in
mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) after ablation, indicating that there is information
upstream of PRC2 dictating localization. Additionally, my preliminary data from a genome wide
knock out screen implicates several factors of interest in regulating polycomb establishment
including RNA binding protein ERH. I will investigate the regulatory role of PRC1 and these
additional factors identified by the screen in PRC2 localization during the establishment of
polycomb domains in mESCs with the following specific aims.
In Aim 1, I will utilize acute protein degradation to investigate PRC1’s ability to re-establish
correct localization on chromatin after depletion. Using a similar strategy with an orthogonal
dual-degron line, I will also determine if PRC1 is necessary for correct PRC2 localization during
establishment.
In Aim 2, I will investigate the functional roles of candidates I identified in my genome wide KO
screen during PRC2’s re-establishment on chromatin in mESCs, leveraging my lab’s expertise
in designing acute protein degradation lines. The experiments in this proposal will elucidate the
order of events and factors involved in the establishment of silent polycomb domains.
To achieve these aims, I have developed with my sponsor a rigorous and comprehensive
training program with three primary goals: 1) become an expert in epigenomics methods, 2)
sharpen my scientific communication skills to broad audiences, 3) increase proficiency in
bioinformatics and data analysis.
I am confident that my choice of sponsor combined with my diverse training background and
the collaborative nature of my training environment will enable me to achieve my goals and
the proposed research plan simultaneously."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressive disease that affects more than 13
million Americans and results in a long period of disability and reduced health related quality of life (HRQoL).
Individuals with COPD are at high risk of financial burden from illness due to costly inhaled bronchodilators,
unplanned ED visits and hospitalizations for acute exacerbations, as well as income loss due to disability.
Financial toxicity, a term that describes the objective financial burden and subjective financial distress resulting
from treatment for illness, has not been studied in COPD but is prevalent in other chronic medical conditions
and has been associated with worse health outcomes. In contrast to absolute cost, financial toxicity takes into
account the proportion of cost to an individual’s or family’s income and its psychological and behavioral impact.
While cost has not been directly associated with worse outcomes in COPD, limited observational studies
relying on self-reported adherence suggest that cost of treatment may contribute to suboptimal medication
adherence. Poor adherence, in turn, is associated with worse outcomes including increased risk of
exacerbations and mortality. Due to the high risk for financial burden in COPD, understanding the association
between financial toxicity, a potentially modifiable determinant, and health outcomes is key to informing future
interventions.
The main objective of this proposal is to describe the impact of financial toxicity on health outcomes in
individuals with COPD. We hypothesize that financial toxicity from treatment of COPD is associated with
increased disability, decreased health related quality of life (HRQoL), and decreased medication adherence
over time. We will use both quantitative and qualitative methods to comprehensively evaluate the role of
financial toxicity in individuals with COPD. Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a large
nationally-representative longitudinal panel, we will assess the association between material financial toxicity
resulting from treatment of COPD with disability and health related quality of life (Specific Aim 1) and
medication adherence (Specific Aim 2). To better understand the impact of financial toxicity on patient
outcomes, we will conduct qualitative semi-structured interviews with individuals who report financial burden
related to treatment for COPD (Specific Aim 3). Taken together, the work from these complementary aims has
the potential to identify areas for a future intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of financial toxicity in this
population, which would serve as the basis for the applicant’s future career development award. This proposal
will also provide the applicant with the skills needed to pursue an independent career as a health services
researcher studying COPD."

unique medium to study this relationship. This proposal posits that ASL's spatial-linguistic features, particularly its
classifier constructions, which depict objects, their orientation, and movement through space, may enhance visual-spatial
abilities in its users. By exploring these connections, we seek to uncover insights into the cognitive impacts of ASL use
and its potential implications for promoting better health, well-being, and healthy aging in Deaf individuals.
 To investigate this, the study will employ electroencephalography (EEG) for its high temporal resolution, focusing
on the mu rhythm over the sensorimotor cortex. This approach aims to uncover how signers process spatial and motor
information during communication and how this translates to skills like navigation and perspective-taking.
 The proposal sets forth two primary objectives:
 1. Examine the Link Between ASL Proficiency and Non-Linguistic Spatial Tasks: This aim addresses how
 proficiency in ASL, characterized by spatial expressions that require frequent perspective shifts, shapes spatial
 cognitive abilities. It hypothesizes that fluent ASL users will demonstrate superior performance in
 perspective-taking, navigation, and orientation tasks, marked by greater accuracy and efficiency.
2. Explore Neural Responses in Spatial Cognitive Tasks Among ASL and Non-ASL Users: This objective seeks to
 understand the neural mechanisms behind spatial cognition in relation to ASL proficiency. It hypothesizes that
 proficient ASL users will exhibit distinct neural patterns, particularly reduced sensorimotor cortex activity during
 spatial tasks, suggesting more efficient processing of spatial information.
The significance of this research lies in its potential to reshape our understanding of the cognitive strengths of ASL users,
with implications for public health. Insights could inform educational and therapeutic approaches, leveraging ASL to
enhance spatial cognition in both deaf and hearing populations. This study not only aims to contribute to the academic
understanding of spatial cognition and language processing but also seeks to influence practical applications in cognitive
health care for diverse populations."
10976880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality across the world.
A considerable portion of healthcare and societal costs associated with the illness are secondary to poor
functional outcomes driven by cognitive impairments. To date, remarkably little is known about the neural and
molecular contributors to functional outcome in mid- to late-life SSD. Iatrogenic effects from the over-prescription
of anticholinergic medicines, including benztropine and trihexyphenidyl, that is common in the chronic phases of
SSD, represents an important and preventable contributor to cognitive impairment, functional disability, and poor
quality of life in mid- to later phases of this condition. Studies from our own and other groups have demonstrated
the negative impact of anticholinergic burden (ACB) in SSD on diverse areas of cognition, which may be
mediated by reductions in prefrontal cortical gray matter and activity. Further, we have shown that connectivity
across a variety of regions linked with neural circuitry of the basal forebrain consistently predicts functional
disability in chronic SSD. In addition, exciting preliminary data from our large SSD outpatient treatment program
showed that it was feasible to deprescribe anticholinergic medications in many long-term patients with clear
benefits to verbal memory and recall, as well as quality of life. Understanding the neural mechanisms of ACB
holds the potential for identifying novel treatment targets in mid- to late-life SSD and is consistent with NIMH
strategic plans to leverage existing treatment strategies (ACB reduction via deprescription) that may optimize
treatment outcomes and develop clinically relevant biosignatures that contribute to our understanding of illness
trajectories. In response to PAR-24-023, “Schizophrenia and related disorders during mid- to late-life”, this
project proposes to conduct a prospective study of the neural, molecular, and functional impacts of
anticholinergic reduction via deprescription in mid- to late-life patients with SSD. A total of 80 individuals with
SSD, ages 40-70, will be studied over the course of 6 months in a randomized controlled trial with half of the
patients (N=40) receiving ACB reduction and the other half (N=40) continuing with their usual care. A separate
sample of 25 healthy volunteers will also be studied to provide normative estimates on study measures and their
reliability. Specific aims focus on understanding the impact of ACB reduction on (1) cognition and quality of life,
(2) neural mechanisms underlying cognitive control and memory, and (3) glutamatergic changes in hippocampus
and anterior cingulate cortex. We address these aims with a diverse team of researchers with expertise in SSD
research, lived experience, psychopharmacology, psychosocial treatment, outcomes research, geriatric
psychiatry, and neuroimaging. Findings are expected to yield new insights into neural and molecular
contributions to outcome in mid- to late-life SSD and identify novel mechanisms to improve functional outcomes
and quality of life in this greatly underserved population."

10980384,"PROJECT SUMMARY (RESEARCH PROJECT 1: THE ROLE OF VULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION ON
THE EFFECTS OF CO-OCCURRING HEAT, AIR POLLUTION, AND WILDFIRE ON HEART FAILURE
HOSPITALIZATIONS)
To protect human health in the changing climate, research is urgently needed to understand adaptation and
mitigation efforts impact on public health while protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring health equity. The
climate-related hazards of high heat and high fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5), related to wildfire (WF-
PM2.5), are increasingly occurring at the same time in California and other regions adversely affecting human
health. Heart failure (HF) as a proposed sentinel climate change and health outcome exposes vulnerable
individuals to heat and PM2.5 health effects due to heightened susceptibility. The research objective is to elucidate
the joint effect of high heat, PM2.5, and WF-PM2.5 on HF hospitalizations and readmissions then evaluate how
these effects may differ by vulnerability factors and adaptation strategies to inform solution-oriented policies and
interventions. An electronic medical record (EMR) enriched with patient neighborhood characterization and state
administrative hospitalization data are used to estimate the effect of co-exposure to heat and (WF-)PM2.5 on HF
hospitalizations (Aim 1). Longitudinal EMR data will allow 30-day readmissions examination as a secondary
outcome. Individual (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status) and neighborhood characteristics (e.g.,
sociodemographics, social vulnerability index, climate vulnerability index) and power outages are assessed to
understand if they modify heat- and PM2.5-effects (Aim 2). Possible adaptation strategies aimed at either the
community (cooling centers/public spaces, community pools, greenspace) or individual level (air conditioning)
are examined to observe how adaptive policies might change heat- and PM2.5-effects (Aim 3). These results will
inform future action-oriented policies, programs, and targeted interventions to mitigate climate change health
effects, especially among the most vulnerable. Research Project 1 will contribute to the University of Southern
California’s (USC) CLIMAte-Related Exposures, Adaptation, and Health Equity (CLIMA) Center’s capacity
building efforts to engage a scientifically diverse research team in conducting and developing approaches for
impactful transdisciplinary climate health research."
10980385,"PROJECT SUMMARY (RESEARC PROJECT 2: The Role of Adaptation and Resilience in a Changing
Climate: Cardiovascular Risk and Allostatic Load Among Youth)
Climate change (CC) is rapidly intensifying, and while mitigating CC is a critical goal, there is an urgent need to
reduce vulnerability to its cardiovascular health (CVH) impacts. Of the rapidly emerging CC threats, heat stress
and wildfire (WF) smoke are strongly linked to adverse CVH outcomes, yet little is known about how CC may
influence CVH profiles across the age spectrum, particularly in youth when adaptation strategies to increase
resilience may be most impactful on long term health. Growing evidence indicates measures of CVH in youth
are associated with cardiovascular endpoints and events in adulthood. While studies have linked air pollution
exposures with early cardiovascular changes in youth, less is known about WF smoke, heat stress, and how co-
exposure may influence these relationships. This question is critical for individuals and communities with lower
CC adaptive capacity and resilience which helps withstand and quickly recover from CC-related hazards.
Allostatic load (AL) correlates with reduced biological resilience to the effects of environmental exposures and
stressors. The AL model posits repeated chronic exposure to (or anticipation of) hazards and stressors – similar
to those experienced with CC - can dysregulate the body's adaptive systems leading to “wear and tear” on organ
systems and greater risk of adverse outcomes over the life course, including CVH. Recent evidence has linked
CC with stress, anxiety, and mental health impacts due to experiencing or anticipating CC hazards; however,
few studies have begun to conceptualize AL's role in CC adaptation and resilience. We hypothesize AL may
serve as a sensitive early indicator of individual, biological resilience to CC-related heat stress and WF smoke
exposures and risk of adverse CVH across the life course. We will investigate these questions in the MetaAir2
cohort, a subset of the Southern California Children's Health Study with 20+ years of active follow-up and
comprehensive CVH assessment of young adults starting in childhood. We aim to understand how lifetime heat
stress and WF smoke exposure independently and jointly impacts blood pressure and pulse rate over time (Aim
1), and AL (Aim 2) in adulthood. We will assess whether neighborhood climate adaptation vulnerabilities (e.g.,
urban heat islands, tree canopies, climate and social vulnerability indices) could modify risk (Aim 3). We will
investigate the association between AL and carotid ultrasound measures of vascular injury in adulthood to inform
AL's utility as an early marker of adverse CVH outcomes and a precision screening measure of individual
biological resilience to CC (Sub-Aim). Developing a greater understanding of CVH impacts of lifetime heat stress
and WF smoke and AL's utility as a personalized measure of biological resilience to CC can inform targeted and
scalable risk screenings. Evaluating the role of neighborhood adaptation vulnerabilities in this context is critical
to designing interventions and action plans that increase climate resilience and mitigate long term CVH impacts."

from historically marginalized communities across all ages to engage in climate resiliency efforts. This will be
achieved by expanding community-academic partnerships, advancing a climate justice framework, integrating
neighborhood-level exposures (Methods Development Research Core, MDRC) and cardiovascular health and
resilience measures (two Research Projects) into dissemination activities, and developing partnerships
necessary to create an actionable community climate and health equity plans. The CEC will leverage community-
engaged and participatory strategies to advance research and understanding around the needs of communities
to address climate equity and implement a program to increase community power through increasing knowledge,
advancing local solutions, and improving dissemination of climate change research. The CEC will be guided by
the following aims: (1) facilitate an intergenerational and multi-directional communication structure that fosters
interaction, shares the Center’s research findings and engagement models with local/regional/national
audiences, and increases Center’s investigators’ understanding of community concerns, with guidance from our
community advisors; (2) build capacity of youth and residents of all ages from environmental health disparity
populations to respond to the climate crisis and associated health burdens and to address those burdens through
community science and public policy; (3) disseminate CLIMA Center research findings to local/national
audiences by utilizing innovative communication methods, tailoring print, audio, and web-based materials and
resources for intended audiences and amplifying our reach through strategic social media communication efforts;
and (4) evaluate the success of CEC activities using several key benchmarks, including (a) engagement of

10977993,"Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability. Two FDA-approved treatments—and ketamine and
accelerated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
(DLPFC)—have emerged as highly effective alternatives to first-line antidepressants, capable of delivering
rapid antidepressant effects even for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) cases. Clinicians who are choosing
between ketamine and rTMS usually rely on a trial-and-error approach that can take months. Biomarkers for
informing this key clinical decision point have the potential to transform the management of TRD by rapidly
matching individual patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them. Leveraging recent technical advances
and building on an extensive foundation of preliminary data establishing the feasibility of predicting accelerated
rTMS and ketamine treatment outcomes, we propose a two-phase project aimed at developing, optimizing, and
testing a new approach to selecting the most effective treatment for individuals with TRD. Individual differences
in treatment outcomes can be understood in part by considering the antidepressant mechanisms of action
underlying these very different treatments and how they interact with neurobiological heterogeneity in TRD.
Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in antidepressant responses to rTMS and ketamine are
due in part to heterogeneity in the neurobiology of depression. We hypothesize that whereas connectivity
deficits involving the prefrontal cortex are a marker of TRD patients who are likely to respond to ketamine-
induced synaptogenesis, intact connectivity between the DLPFC stimulation site and downstream targets in the
anterior cingulate and insula will be associated with enhanced rTMS responses. In the UG3 phase, we will use
state-of-the-art machine learning methods to optimize statistical classifiers (“neuroimaging biomarkers”) for
predicting antidepressant responses in individual patients. We will enhance model performance by a) refining a
subtyping procedure we developed; b) incorporating precision functional mapping of network topology; and c)
optimizing for robust and reproducible results in held-out data. In parallel, we will validate our biomarker
approach in a prospective pilot study, validating the reliability, acceptability, and feasibility of fMRI biomarkers.
In the UH3 phase, we evaluate the efficacy of this approach in a prospective clinical trial, randomizing to
receive DLPFC-rTMS or ketamine, informed by our biomarkers, and evaluate their utility for supporting new,
highly scalable models for predicting outcomes without the need for fMRI data in a subset of individuals."

The UC Davis ReACH Equity predoctoral training program responds to NINR’s call to action to address the
impacts of societal inequities in health and healthcare by training a new generation of scientists to employ
advanced, multidisciplinary, multi-level methods to improve health equity. We will provide a rich training
environment for 26 predoctoral trainees to establish the evidence base for improving health equity across the
lifespan among historically and presently marginalized communities (HMCs) through research at the
systemic/policy, community/services, and family/individual levels. The objectives are to: 1) recruit and retain a
diverse group of predoctoral trainees who conduct rigorous, innovative, equity-focused research in prevention
science and population health; 2) empower ReACH Equity trainees to make informed decisions about the
breadth of research-focused career paths, including academia, public policy, and industry; and 3) educate
trainees in multidisciplinary approaches to equity-focused prevention science and population health, including
core doctoral competencies (e.g., conceptual knowledge, developing important research questions, community
engagement, all facets of study design, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination, and professional
development). These objectives are accomplished in a carefully structured program that leverages the
expertise of 50 mentors, the majority of whom are underrepresented in science, from 17 individual
Departments in three Colleges, the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing, and the School of Medicine on both
our Sacramento and Davis campuses. These mentors’ expertise cuts across the disciplinary spectra (e.g.,
nursing science, human development, psychology, sociology, nutrition, computer science, public health
sciences, health policy), focuses on a wide variety of HMC populations, and addresses inequities from prenatal
populations through older adults. We will use the peer-onsite-distance model of mentoring, where trainees will
be matched to a primary mentorship team that includes one experienced mentor and one mentor-in-training;
this team will serve as their content experts. Each cohort also will have a cohort mentor to facilitate group and
peer mentoring. Trainees will engage in didactic and experiential learning that will provide them with the core
competencies and in-depth theoretical knowledge required for successful careers in health equity by ensuring
that advances in equity-focused prevention science and population health are utilized among HMCs. We will
engage in continuous quality improvement through ongoing internal evaluation of processes and outcomes, as
well as reviews from an external advisory board and a local community advisory board comprised of patients
and families. The disciplinary diversity combined with expertise mentoring individuals from HMCs among our
pool of mentors will support trainees to invoke research questions that enable collaboration with a
multidisciplinary team of investigators to elucidate the complex interplay of factors that contribute to health
inequities, and then to use multiple perspectives and methodologies to identify sustainable solutions."
10999951,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mass production of tissues and organs is the ultimate goal of biomanufacturing, but this goal will not be
achieved without the assistance of engineering design tools that predict how three-dimensional, multicellular
structures, comprised of cells that dynamically respond to each other and their environment, self-organize into
spatially patterned tissues. To date, no such design tools exist, and our high-risk, high-reward proposal seeks
to develop and validate the first multiscale computational model to inform the design, fabrication, and self-
assembly of tissues comprised of heterogeneous cell types engineered with synthetic gene circuits regulating
cell adhesion. We recently published a relatively simple agent-based computational model, that when coupled
with machine learning algorithms, identifies design parameters that generate multicell spheroids, or simple
tissues, comprised of heterogeneous subpopulations of cells that self-organize into specific patterns (e.g.,
striped, soccer ball, core/shell, and core/pole). The proposed work will greatly elaborate this simple model to a
multiscale computational model to predict how collections of bioprinted spheroids form into spatially patterned
“assembloids.” We will utilize mixed populations of two cell types genetically engineered with highly modular
synNotch synthetic gene circuits, which propagate intracellular signals to regulate cell-cell adhesion strength
based on cell-cell interactions. We will also leverage state-of-the-art 3D printing spheroid positioning
technology developed at our institution to precisely place three-dimensional spheroids adjacent to one another
within a synthetic biomaterial that facilitates the formation of engineered tissue constructs. In Aim 1, we will
develop a novel multiscale agent-based computational model that predicts how synNotch-mediated
intercellular signaling and intracellular signaling in individual cells gives rise to self-sorting of heterogeneous
cell populations, leading to the emergent patterning of three-dimensional tissues. We will run tens of thousands
of simulations and apply clustering algorithms to extract design parameters that favor certain three-dimensional
tissue patterns over others. In Aim 2, we will experimentally validate that the computational model can be
reliably used to design three-dimensional multicellular tissue constructs by challenging it to identify the design
parameters (e.g., initial number of cells, ratio of cell subpopulations, heterotypic and homotypic cell-cell
adhesion strengths) that will generate three-dimensional assembloids with specific multicellular patterns. We
will culture synNotch cells into spheroids and spatially position them into tissue assembloids according to the
design parameters predicted by the computer model, and then we will assess if the experimental tissues,
imaged using confocal microscopy, exhibit the spatial patterns predicted by the computational model. We
expect that our project, which tightly integrates computational modeling with experiments, will significantly
advance the fields of three-dimensional bioprinting, biomanufacturing, and multiscale computational modeling
of multicellular tissues and enable the robust generation of complex tissue structures by design."
11000157,"Abstract
Animal venoms are complex natural secretions that comprise a mixture of bioactive compounds often referred
to as toxins. Although the number of venomous animals is often underappreciated by the general public, venom
is in fact one of the most frequently evolved functional traits among animals, with over a hundred independently
evolved venomous lineages across the animal trees of life. Despite this diversity, the molecular structure and
targets of toxins, which include receptors and voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, are relatively conserved
throughout the animal kingdom. These features make venoms extremely successful evolutionary innovations
and ideal candidates for discovery and development of therapeutics to treat a wide range of human pathologies.
Indeed, there are currently six commercially available venom-derived drug peptides, and venom research is
growing exponentially, as evidenced by the increase in venom publications, symposia, biomedical applications,
and biotech startup companies. Consequently, the World Economic Forum recently designated Venomics as
one of the four most promising frontiers of science, highlighting the socio-economic impacts of these activities.
Venoms also represent a significant burden on human health, with World Health Organization classifying
snakebite as a “Category A Neglected Tropical Disease” and launching a global strategy for prevention and
control of snakebite envenoming. Realizing the full potential of venom and addressing its societal burden
remains challenging due to a scarcity of opportunities to create a cohesive research community covering the
many diverse facets of venom research, which span health and socioeconomic concerns to essentially all areas
of basic and applied bioscience. Hence, no single conference links experts in the basic and applied sciences of
venomous animals to those investigating the clinical, physiological and pharmacological applications of venom.
The 2024 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Venom Evolution, Function and Biomedical
Applications (Venoms-GRC/GRS) aims to overcome these hurdles by coalescing an interdisciplinary group of
academic and industry professionals to address venom as both a global health problem and a route to innovation
in health solutions. Our goals are to evaluate needs and roadblocks pertaining to drug discovery and
development, foster cross-sector collaborations that better meet the challenges in development and
implementation of novel treatments of envenoming and identify future directions for venom research, enabling
the field to grow. The conference chairs are making significant efforts to invite a culturally, ethnically, and gender
diverse group of 150 established and younger faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students to the 2024
Venoms GRC/GRS. These scientists bring expertise from a broad diversity of fields, from clinical to ecological
to genomics/proteomics, and we made a special effort to invite early career speakers that are emerging leaders
in their specialties, Our program will foster a community of experts focused on complementary and integrative
topics in venoms, drug discovery and development – key issues that are particularly relevant to the NCCIH."

Exons in the genome that lead to the introduction of premature truncation (stop) codon and mark these
transcripts as targets for nonsense-mediated decay are called poison exons (PEs). These PEs are alternatively
spliced throughout mouse and human neurodevelopment and function. Moreover, genetic variants that perturb
the splicing of PEs have been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including epilepsy,
malformations of cortical development and a pediatric neurodegenerative disorder. These exons are also
targeted by antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) based therapies in active clinical trials in rare genetic epilepsies.
However, the prevailing contribution of these elements to neurological disease is unknown for several reasons,
(1) we do not know how these genetic variants lead to ectopic PE splicing (2) the full repertoire of PEs used
throughout neurodevelopment is unknown and (3) the genomic features that define these elements are not
known. To address these challenges, we propose a multidisciplinary effort that integrates conventional splice
reporters, proteomics, patient-specific stem cell models, combinatorial long-read single-cell sequencing and
machine learning methods that will elucidate the characteristics of PEs used in neurodevelopment and the
properties of genetic variants that lead to aberrant splicing and neurological disease. In Aim 1 of this study, we
will determine how the PE spliceosome is perturbed in individuals with epilepsy who harbor pathogenic
variants that cause ectopic SCN1A PE splicing. We will determine the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that lead
to ectopic splicing and use ASOs to modulate splicing and correct the aberrant PE inclusion in patient-specific
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. For novel PE discovery we have previously successfully
used long-read transcriptome sequencing to detect these exons in iPSC-derived organoids and human brain
tissue, and enhanced their discovery by inhibiting NMD with cycloheximide (CHX). In Aim 2, we will use MAS-
ISO-seq which integrates both long-read and single-cell sequencing to generate cell-type specific maps of PE
usage across neurodevelopment. Moreover, we will use high-depth short read-sequencing, including of CHX
treated cells to boost the discovery of PEs. In Aim 3 we will determine the genomic features that define PEs
and use this information to detect genetic variants that can perturb splicing of these exons. We will mine
publicly available genome sequencing data from individuals with NDDs to identify additional individuals with
putative pathogenic variants that alter PE splicing and develop a webtool for dissemination to the community.
Collectively, the outcomes of this study will provide a comprehensive map of PEs used throughout
neurodevelopment facilitating future studies in brain development and function, resolving undiagnosed NDDs
and other neurological disorders, as well as therapeutic ASO targets for neurological disease."
10978395,"Familial dysautonomia (FD), also known as HSAN type III or Riley-Day syndrome, is a rare, fatal,
congenital sensory and autonomic neuropathy caused by a splicing mutation in the Elongator
acetyltransferase complex subunit 1 (ELP1) gene. This mutation results in variable tissue-specific
skipping of exon 20 with a corresponding reduction of ELP1 protein, mainly in the central and peripheral
nervous systems. Patients with FD have a complex neurological phenotype with diminished pain and
temperature perception, decreased or absent myotatic reflexes, proprioceptive gait ataxia, and
progressive retinal degeneration. ELP1 is reduced in both the central and peripheral nervous systems;
however, for reasons that are still unknown, ELP1 reduction preferentially impacts peripheral neurons.
While the development of a splicing modulator therapy to treat FD patients has been a primary focus
of my laboratory, over the past several years, we have also worked to develop and characterize several
mouse models for FD, to elucidate the developmental pathways that are disrupted by ELP1 reduction,
to identify genes that are specifically dysregulated in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and to
evaluate the phenotypic consequences of ELP1 splicing correction. Despite remarkable progress in
each of these areas, there are still key gaps in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying the cell-type-specific neuronal degeneration that characterized FD. We know that mis-
splicing of ELP1 occurs at different levels in all cell types, but it is much worse in neurons. We also
know that subpopulations of peripheral neurons are exquisitely sensitive to the loss of ELP1, but we
don’t know precisely which cell types or the underlying transcriptomic changes that lead to specific cell
loss in FD. It is this overarching question that lays the foundation for the Aims of this renewal
application. We have assembled an excellent team with varied expertise, and together we will 1)
identify cell-type specific dysregulated genes and networks in the nervous system of our FD mice 2)
spatially characterize ELP1 mis-splicing and its contribution to cell-type-specific gene dysregulation in
DRG and retina and 3) define cell-type-specific pathogenetic mechanisms and validate the
dysregulated gene networks using human neuronal models of FD. This study will not only unravel the
molecular mechanisms of cell-type specific degeneration in FD but will also shed light on the role of
ELP1 and Elongator in neuronal gene regulation and how its disruption leads to human developmental
neuropathies."
10978396,"Project Summary
This project’s long-term objective is to elucidate mechanisms that control hair-bundle development and function,
show how defects in these mechanisms cause deafness and vestibular disorders, and identify pathways that
could be modulate to ameliorate these syndromes. Because the ability to control bundle development may assist
in hair-cell regeneration strategies, our project aims to uncover the mechanisms a hair cell uses to regulate and
modulate steps in bundle growth. Although our past work focused on postnatal development of bundles of apical
inner hair cells (IHCs) from the mouse cochlea, here we expand our scope here to include embryonic
development, outer hair cells (OHCs), and hair cells from apex to base of the cochlea. In the first Aim, we will
collect (and share) datasets of stereocilia actin and key row-specific proteins for IHCs from mid cochlear regions
to the base and OHCs from apex to base. Our goal is to discern the broad developmental plan for cochlea
bundles, and to identify the steps that individual hair cells modulate to create the distinct arrangements of
stereocilia in these diverse bundles. In the second Aim, we will characterize the first stage of stereocilia growth,
stage II in Tilney’s categorization, by measuring stereocilia dimensions, determining locations and concentrations
of key proteins, and revealing the presence of interstereocilia links during embryonic development. Importantly,
we will use mouse mutants to determine roles for the tip-link cadherins CDH23 and PCDH15, as well as the
molecular motors MYO15A, MYO7A, MYO3A, and MYO3B. In the final Aim, we address how the pattern of
stereocilia arrangement on the hair cell’s apical surface is determined. Our hypothesis is that spacing is initially
set when stereocilia grow during stage II; as they are tightly packed together then with their spacing set by
stereocilia width, their pattern is set and stabilized by growth of the rootlets and their interconnections through
rootlet-rootlet filaments and the cuticular plate. Mice lacking ANKRD24, GRXCR2, MYO7A, or SPTAN1 have
substantially altered stereocilia packing in mature hair cells, suggesting that these four proteins—and likely many
others—participate in setting stereocilia spacing."
10979021,"PROJECT ABSTRACT / SUMMARY:
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment, but many patients fail to respond.
Expanding the response to ICIs is a major goal in immuno-oncology. We and others recently discovered that
blocking exosome biogenesis through the genetic depletion of nSMase2 can overcome resistance to ICIs in
multiple mouse models leading to robust antitumor immune response and inhibition of tumor growth. Therefore,
we hypothesize that small molecule inhibition of nSMase2 could be a novel therapeutic strategy to promote
antitumor immunity. There are no clinically available nSMase2 inhibitors. Current inhibitors have low potency,
unknown selectivity, and poor physicochemical properties. Our team recently carried out a human nSMase2 high
throughput screening campaign followed by structural optimization of the hits. These efforts led to the
identification of PDDC, the first nanomolar potent (IC50=300-600nM), selective, and orally bioavailable nSMase2
inhibitor. PDDC, however, exhibits limitations that hamper its clinical translation including moderate potency,
poor solubility, high protein binding, and unexpectedly low exposures in higher species (rat, dog, primate).
Despite these limitations, we present preliminary data showing the effectiveness of PDDC in an ICI-resistant
mouse model. Here, we propose three aims to build on these findings with the goal of identifying an optimized
nSMase2 inhibitor that is effective across multiple mouse and human cancer models and ready for advancement
to IND-enabling studies. In AIM 1, we will synthesize PDDC analogs to improve potency, solubility, and
pharmacokinetics (PK). Analogs will be tested in vitro for potency, chemical stability, solubility, interspecies
metabolic stability, permeability, and selectivity. Compounds meeting prespecified in vitro criteria will advance to
PK and tumor target engagement studies in mice. Inhibitors passing mouse criteria will be prioritized for PK in
rats and dogs. A predefined Preclinical Target Product Profile will guide our optimization activities. In AIM 2,
PDDC and selected optimized analogs which are shown to provide robust inhibition of tumor nSMase2 activity
in vivo in Aim 1 will be evaluated for efficacy/tolerability in multiple mouse syngeneic models. We will compare
their effectiveness to nSMase2 knockout models as well as test their ability to suppress growth after tumors are
well established. We will delve into the mechanism of action by evaluating the impact of the inhibitors alone or
together with ICIs on the immune infiltration into the tumors using single-cell analytic tools. In AIM 3, we will
evaluate the efficacy/tolerability of the optimized PDDC analogs in human models of cancer. We will evaluate
the ability to block tumor exosome production in vivo and again compare small molecule inhibition to genetic
knockout in regulating the ability of immune cells to effectively target and kill their cancer cell targets. Successful
completion of these aims is expected to produce 1-2 prodrugs will good oral bioavailability (F%>30), acceptable
safety profile and robust efficacy in inhibiting tumor growth of both mouse and human cancer models through an
immune-dependent mechanism. Such a result would be highly significant as it has the potential to greatly expand
the number of patients who respond to immune therapies."

Visual decision-making in the brain is thought to depend on two behaviorally distinguishable computational
components: one that converts uncertain visual inputs into a decision variable, and a second that applies a rule
to the decision variable to commit to a choice. Our long-term goal is to understand the neural mechanisms that
implement these computational components of high-order visual processing, which represent key building blocks
of cognition. Here we propose to examine where and how visual decision rules are implemented in the brain.
We build on three primary innovations: 1) a novel theoretical framework predicting that normative decision rules
tend not to be static, as prescribed in many commonly used decision models, but rather dynamic with flexible
adjustments both within and across decisions; 2) a novel task design that allows us to control the decision
variable and measure decision commitment directly for each decision; and 3) measurements and manipulations
of neural activity at multiple cortical and subcortical components of a key oculomotor pathway to assess their
relative contributions to implementing and updating flexible decision rules. We have three Specific Aims. Aim 1
is to characterize flexible decision rule use by monkeys. Aim 2 is to identify correlative relationships between
neural activity in the oculomotor pathway and decision rules on single trials. We targe the frontal eye field and
lateral intraparietal area of the cortex; the substantia nigra pars reticulata, which is a major output structure of
the oculomotor basal ganglia; and the superior colliculus, which receives input from the other three regions. Aim
3 is to identify causal relationships between neural activity in these brain regions and decision rules on single
trials. Results from the proposed project will provide new, theoretically motivated, and empirically grounded
insights into circuit mechanisms that control a major building block of deliberative information processing in the
brain: the rules that govern when and how to end the deliberations and commit to an action. These results will
help to provide a solid foundation for investigating cognitive impairments associated with dysfunction of the
cortico-basal ganglia pathway."

Stillbirths and neonatal deaths are two adverse birth outcomes of critical global health relevance. In 2021, an
estimated 1.9 million babies were stillborn, and 2.3 million liveborn babies died before reaching 28 days of age.
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) stands out globally as the world region having the largest number of stillbirths and
neonatal deaths (respectively 847,000 and 1,067,000 in 2021). These large numbers not only reflect large
population sizes, but also high levels of stillbirth and neonatal mortality in the SSA region. Moreover, not only
are neonatal mortality rates high in countries of the SSA region relative to other world regions, but in many
SSA countries, they are high relative to the country’s own levels of postneonatal mortality. This indicates the
existence in many SSA populations of a distorted age pattern of mortality at early ages with excess mortality at
neonatal ages, impeding their ability to meet Sustainable Development Goals targets. In spite of the
significance of these patterns, measurement and understanding of stillbirth rates and neonatal mortality in
SSA countries are hindered by major gaps in data availability and quality. Undercount of stillbirths and
neonatal deaths as well as misclassification of neonatal deaths vs. stillbirths in existing, mostly retrospective
sources remain major concerns. Issues with availability and quality of information on preterm, low birthweight
and small for gestational age – three major risk factors that can play a large role in both levels and age patterns
of early-age mortality – are additional gaps that further impede proper monitoring of patterns of mortality
during the late fetal and neonatal periods in the SSA region. The goal of this project is to improve our
understanding of why many SSA populations stand out globally in terms of both their levels and age patterns of
mortality during the late fetal and neonatal periods by collecting new prospective data in three surveillance
sites located in three different SSA countries (Ethiopia, Gambia and Guinea-Bissau), covering a variety of
contexts. While the focus of this project is on three SSA populations located in Ethiopia, Gambia and Guinea-
Bissau, results will have methodological and substantive implications for other low-income countries, including
other SSA countries, which are characterized by a high burden of stillbirths and neonatal mortality as well as
large data gaps in their stillbirth and neonatal mortality information."
10999747,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer (PCa) is a clinically and molecular heterogenous disease, with distinct subtypes. These
subtypes are associated with characteristic genomic alterations, gene expression profiles, and treatment
responses, implying truly distinct biology. We have defined one such molecular subclass of PCa characterized
by recurrent missense mutations in the ubiquitin ligase SPOP -- representing about 10-15% of PCa, in both
primary and metastatic disease. These SPOP mutant cancers display distinct biology and response to
therapies. However, other key players in the SPOP pathway influencing its action in PCa, and the
broader ability to specifically target this axis for patient benefit, remain incompletely understood.
Preliminary data generated by our multidisciplinary, collaborative group have defined novel elements of the
SPOP signaling pathway, including the upstream regulator G3BP1, and suggest that the subclass of PCa
defined by deregulation of SPOP signaling are preferentially targetable with novel therapeutic interventions.
The overall objective of this proposal is to define the mechanistic, biological, and therapeutic consequences of
alterations to the SPOP signaling pathway, including its upstream regulator G3BP1. Using novel models and
human prostate cancer samples, our preliminary data demonstrate that a novel endogenous inhibitor of the
SPOP ubiquitin ligase, G3BP1, can potentially phenocopy the oncogenic effects of SPOP mutation, and that
modulation of this effect with small molecule inhibitors can be a viable therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, we
show that modulating SPOP activity reprograms androgen receptor (AR) function through key downstream
substrates, altering chromatin accessibility and transcription driven by AR and making these cancers highly
reliant on AR activity.
This project will elucidate the molecular details underlying these phenomena through the following Aims: 1)
define the role of G3BP1-driving prostate tumorigenesis in model systems and human prostate cancer, and the
ability to target this upstream axis. 2) establish the therapeutic potential of targeting the SPOP axis by modulating
targetable downstream signaling nodes. To accomplish this, we will leverage unique, biologically and clinically
relevant model systems, novel small molecule inhibitors, innovative approaches to modulating ubiquitin ligase
signaling, and data from human prostate cancer samples. This project will define the critical dependencies in
specific subtypes of prostate cancer and broader applicability to treatment response, and provide the foundation
for precision clinical trials and novel strategies to attack this subclass of cancer."
10986511,"The basis for the onset and progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related dementias remains unknown,
but the formation and spread of aggregates of the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn) between neurons has been
identiﬁed as a likely mechanism. Thus, understanding the molecular underpinnings of this prion-like spread is
a key step that would set the stage for developing therapies to delay or alleviate PD-related motor dysfunction
and dementia. However, to date, there has been no viable method to comprehensively investigate the under-
lying phenomena of aggregation in live cells, and certainly not in vivo. The long-term goal of this research is
to deﬁne the molecular mechanisms that contribute to neurodegeneration in people with PD and related de-
mentias, in order to stimulate the development of new therapies. The overall objective of this application is to
establish a role for aSyn-mediated membrane permeabilization in the spread of aSyn neuropathology in PD.
The central hypothesis is that aSyn oligomers derived from internalized preformed ﬁbrils (PFFs) facilitate the
endocytic escape of aSyn seeds by permeabilizing the endocytic membrane from within. This hypothesis will
be addressed with the following speciﬁc aims: (i) Deﬁne aSyn assembly states in different subcellular loca-
tions of PFF-treated neurons; and (ii) Deﬁne aSyn assembly states at various stages of PFF-mediated aSyn
propagation in vivo. The project entails ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) studies with neurons,
where lifetime depends on aggregation level, as well as steps to application in vivo, enabled by high-resolution
three-dimensional ﬂuorescence localization with point-wise lifetime information (and hence insight into the aSyn
self-assembly state) at various positions in the brain over time. Notably, ﬂuorescence quenching and hence
lifetime reduction, similar to what occurs in ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), has been shown
by the group to occur when aSyn fused to a ﬂuorescent protein (aSyn-FP) undergoes self-assembly to a beta-
sheet-rich, aggregated state, with a lifetime that reduces with increasing aggregate size. This provides a means
to study aSyn aggregate formation and spread using high-resolution FLIM (Aim 1). Drawing on the group's
conceptualization and demonstration of a means to image ﬂuorescence parameters in vivo and through heavy
scatter, and also at high resolution using computational imaging with localization, ﬂuorescence lifetime param-
eters determined at a set of locations in the brain should yield aSyn aggregate and spread information (Aim 2).
Upon completion of this project, live-cell studies will have allowed aSyn aggregation and spread to be character-
ized, which should lead to understanding of the molecular process, and critical steps to optical sensing of aSyn
aggregate spread in the whole brain of animals will have been achieved. This approach is innovative because it
is focused on new technologies and research avenues related to the propagation of aSyn pathology in PD and
related dementias. The research is signiﬁcant because the new knowledge from this study would set the stage
for developing therapeutic strategies to interfere with the spread of aSyn aggregates in the brains of patients."
10987220,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Epilepsy is responsible for about 1% of the global burden of disease, with the highest disease-related
burden found in sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of people with epilepsy (>80%) live in low-resource
settings, as is found in Kenya, where most have limited access to care. Delay in antiseizure medication
(ASM) initiation and ASM non-adherence increase the disease-related burden in terms of low quality of life,
high healthcare costs, and risk for seizure-related injuries and premature death. Our prior study at a tertiary
public hospital in western Kenya showed that only 28% of newly diagnosed people with epilepsy (PWE)
returned for follow-up, indicating a large treatment gap. Cost-effective, context-specific, and culturally
appropriate interventions are critical to addressing access to care and improving epilepsy care retention and
ASM adherence in PWE. The long-term goal of our research program is to address access to care and
improve epilepsy treatment outcomes across the lifespan in western Kenya. We hypothesize that an
evidence-based, task-sharing intervention supported by patient tracking data using an Epilepsy Medical
Record System (EMRS) will provide a scalable and cost-effective approach to improving care retention, ASM
adherence, and epilepsy care outcomes in western Kenya. Aim 1 is to build clinical and research capacity
through the development of EMRS, the clinical training of less specialized staff to implement task-sharing
intervention and the mentorship of a Kenyan investigator. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness, identify the
mechanisms, and explore the sustainability of the task-sharing intervention supported by EMRS in
improving epilepsy care outcomes. We will conduct a cluster-randomized trial comparing usual care and
intervention groups to quantify the intervention's effectiveness in improving epilepsy care outcomes. Aim
3 is to conduct incremental cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of the intervention relative to
usual care. In a long-standing partnership with the Government of Kenya, the Academic Model Providing
Access to Healthcare Partnership (AMPATH) has expanded its clinical scope of work in rural western Kenya to
address issues with chronic disease management. The proposed research will be conducted in
collaboration with AMPATH. The study is innovative in that it will be the first intervention designed to improve
access to care and epilepsy care outcomes in western Kenya. In addition, the clinical and research
capacity-building effort will strengthen the health system capacity for epilepsy care and future independent
research. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the lives of people living with
epilepsy, ensure capacity building, and provide evidence-based and sustainable strategies to inform clinical
practice changes and policy development to improve epilepsy care outcomes and reduce the treatment
gap in resource-limited settings."
10988018,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Preterm birth is a major medical problem resulting in disability and death for very preterm infants. Therapeutic approaches
to manage preterm labor are off-label and ineffective. No tocolytic therapy in use today is satisfactory beyond 48 hours, and
none is FDA approved. Preterm labor more often impacts African American women than their Caucasian counterparts and
is exacerbated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which leads to preterm birth in COVID-
19 affected pregnancies. Our central hypotheses are that designed multi-ligand (DML) drugs to be generated in this research
that target dysregulated pathways in preterm myometrium will provide a therapeutic benefit in cases of preterm labor while
decreasing fetal exposure to the compounds, and that co-administration of the DML’s ‘constituent single entities’ will
exhibit synergistic tocolysis. In addition to providing a potential synergistic benefit, we expect that our DMLs will be poorly
transported across the placenta due to favorable pharmacokinetic properties of the DMLs, and thus will protect the fetus
from exposure. Decreased placental transfer will improve dose-ranging for clinical benefit to prevent preterm labor. This
research will justify novel DMLs as potential new tocolytics to prevent preterm birth. This proposal will generate novel
DMLs using advanced Medicinal Chemistry techniques and will make extensive use of ex vivo and in vivo experimentation
using both human and mouse tissue. The long term goal of this project is to generate first-in-class tocolytics that will delay
or halt early labor and prevent preterm birth."

Oral contraceptives (OCs) contain synthetic estrogen and progesterone and are prescribed to millions of women
in the United States for some period during their reproductive years. OCs also are approved for use after onset
of menarche, which is well before brain maturation is complete. Among adult women, imaging studies suggest
that use of OCs is associated with changes in brain structure and function. It is likely that cellular level changes
also occur in the brain with OC use, particularly during the neurobiologically dynamic adolescent/young adult
years. Surprisingly, there are no studies investigating the potential impact of OCs on the developing female brain,
establishing a critical need to determine the potential effects of synthetic hormones on early life brain biology. In
this application, we propose to investigate neuron-derived exosome (NDE) microRNA (miRNA) as a
neurobiological index. Exosomes are membrane-bound sacs that transport biologically active materials
throughout the body to promote homeostasis and facilitate intercellular signaling. Exosomes are released by
most tissues, including neurons, as routine physiology, easily crossing the blood brain barrier. Exosomes are
also present in many different biofluids. Alterations to exosome characteristics have been associated with the
pathophysiology of several cancers and neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s). It is hypothesized that
differential expression of NDE miRNAs may aid identification of aberrations in biological pathway regulation as
a function of OC exposure. To investigate the effect of OCs on early life neurobiology, NDE miRNA expression
in young women prescribed OCs will be compared to natural cycling, OC naïve females. We will recruit 60 young
women (15-22 years), including N=30 young women using OCs > 6 months and 30 natural cycling, OC naïve
young women. This study will take advantage of the comprehensive Affymetrix GeneChip array to inventory
miRNAs to index brain-based cellular perturbations. The OC use group will participate in two study visits, for a
total of 60 person-time points while the natural cycling, OC naïve group will complete four study visits during the
early follicular, late follicular, ovulation, and luteal phases for a total of 120 person-time points. As a first step, it
will be necessary to understand whether NDE miRNA expression fluctuates as a function of hormonal milieu.
Thus, Aim 1 will characterize NDE miRNA expression across the menstrual cycle while Aim 2 will determine
whether NDE miRNA differs across the active and inactive pill phases. Finally, Aim 3 will characterize the NDE
miRNA landscape in OC users. NDE miRNAs identified in Aim 3 also will be probed with complementary network-
based analyses to identify involved neurophysiological pathways. Insights from this study will clarify whether
there is scientific merit to proceed to in vivo studies as well as causally informative, longitudinal studies of OCs
to elucidate the impact of synthetic hormones on female neurobiology. The goal of this line of research is to
inform women’s health decisions and promote development of innovative menstrual health treatments."

Disabilities, including those due to a stroke, are common among older adults worldwide, affecting about 36% of
adults 65 and older in the USA.1 As the world’s population ages, the need for effective, affordable, accessible
rehabilitation will increase. This need is particularly acute in low and middle income countries (LMICs), which
carry 90% of the global stroke burden.2 Limited healthcare resources in LMICs necessitate practical solutions
such as community-based rehabilitation and affordable robotics that allow caregivers to help with rehabilitation.
My goal is to improve community-based robotic therapy by implementing a joint learning paradigm for
individuals with varying levels of motor and cognitive impairment. Haptic interaction or the transmission of
tactile information using sensations such as vibration, touch, and force feedback between individuals can improve
rehabilitation. Haptically connected individuals in a multiplayer game may experience the social and motivational
advantages as well as the implicit communication channel afforded by a haptic connection to a partner. The goal
of this project is to determine how individuals with varying motor and cognitive impairments communicate and
learn during haptic interaction in order to better design haptic feedback for multiplayer rehabilitation robot games.
 The rst specic aim is to leverage an affordable robotic rehabilitation platform to study how age and
stroke-related motor and cognitive impairments inuence motor learning when individuals are haptically
connected to a partner. Healthy older adults and older adult stroke survivors will learn a robot-based motor
task with a 1-week follow-up assessment. I expect that a haptic connection to a partner with similar or less
motor impairment will result in greater motor learning, especially for those with age or stroke related cognitive
impairments, than learning individually. I also expect that a haptic connection to a partner with greater motor
impairment will reduce motor learning. The second aim is to develop a model of sensorimotor communication
using inverse optimal control techniques that accounts for motor and cognitive impairments. This model will
reveal how age and stroke related motor and cognitive impairments mediate different sensory feedback channels
(e.g., visual, haptic). Finally, the third aim is to develop an adaptive dyadic controller that balances differing
partner ability levels in a robot-based haptic dyad. This adaptive dyadic rehabilitation robot will enable older
adults with motor and/or cognitive impairments to interact and support each other’s rehabilitative efforts.
 This project will help answer fundamental questions about how motor and cognitive impairments inuence
sensorimotor communication, providing design insight for robotic rehabilitation. Done in the context of a pre-doctoral
training plan, this work, which helps to develop an independent researcher at the intersection of robotics and
rehabilitation science, will be completed within Mechanical Engineering, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and
the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania."

Lymphatic vessels are a critical component of the immune response to pathogens because they transport
leukocytes carrying antigens to lymph nodes (LNs) to facilitate antigen presentation. Now known to actively
shape the innate and adaptive immune responses, lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) express chemokines and
receptors, secrete mediators such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21),
modulate dendritic cell (DC) function, and regulate trafficking of immune cells into LNs. Lymphatic dysfunction
also plays a significant role in many diseases, yet little is known about how lymphatic dysfunction impacts
response to infection. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is a G-protein coupled receptor highly
expressed on lymphocytes and endothelial cells that is important for angiogenesis, barrier function, and immune
cell trafficking. Others report decreased S1PR1 on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) is associated with
lymphedema and skewed CD4 T cell activation in mice and humans. Our collaborators in the Srinivasan lab
discovered that mice lacking S1PR1 on LECs (S1pr1ΔLEC mice) have enhanced VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR3)
signaling that, in multiple organs, leads to increased lymphatic vessel density and spontaneous formation of
tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs), which are organized accumulations of immune cells that form in non-lymphoid
tissues with infection or inflammation. The impact that these altered CD4 T cell responses and aberrant TLOs
found with deficiency of LEC-expressed S1PR1 have on the immune response to infection is unclear. I
hypothesize that, in S1pr1ΔLEC mice with influenza A infection (IAV), increased VEGFR3-mediated
lymphangiogenesis will enhance the lymphatic CCL21 gradient and increase dendritic cell (DC) migration from
the lung to the draining mediastinal lymph node (mLN) and that pulmonary TLO formation will enhance viral
clearance compared to infected controls, but deficient S1PR1 signaling in LECs will alter mLN architecture and
impair generation of B and T lymphocyte memory. To test this, I will infect S1pr1ΔLEC mice with IAV in the following
aims. In aim 1, I will examine viral clearance, lymphatic branching, pulmonary TLO formation, DC migration from
the lungs to the mLN and spleen, and the transcriptome of S1pr1-deficient LECs. To determine whether
phenotypes in S1pr1ΔLEC mice are due to excess VEGFR3, I will also perform these studies in S1pr1ΔLEC mice
with a reduced gene dosage of Vegfr3. In aim 2, I will investigate lymphocyte memory responses in S1pr1ΔLEC
mice with IAV by quantifying antigen-specific T cells and memory B cells, measuring IAV-specific antibodies,
examining mLN architecture, and studying response to challenge IAV infection. Preliminary data from my studies
show S1pr1ΔLEC mice have reduced morbidity, increased pulmonary TLO formation, altered DC migration, and
impaired antibody production following IAV infection. The successful completion of these studies will provide
novel insight into the interactions of immune cells with the lymphatic endothelium during infection and have
implications for development of therapeutics that act on lymphatic pathologies."

Optic neuropathies, a wide-ranging group of eye diseases, primarily target the optic nerve and frequently result
in irreversible vision loss. Globally affecting millions, these conditions stem from a variety of causes such as
glaucoma, ischemic, inflammatory, compressive, toxic, and hereditary factors, each with distinct
pathophysiological traits. Characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells, these diseases lead to
changes in the optic nerve head and visual field defects. The diverse onset and myriad underlying causes of
these neuropathies complicate early diagnosis, underscoring the necessity for advanced diagnostic tools.
This project proposes leveraging deep learning-based morphometric analysis in optical coherence tomography
(OCT) to develop innovative biomarkers for optic neuropathies. OCT, a non-invasive imaging technique, has
revolutionized the diagnosis and management of these conditions, providing detailed retinal and optic nerve
head imagery. However, its efficacy is limited by device-dependent variability, signal quality dependency, and
insufficient sensitivity of current thickness markers in chronic disease monitoring.
This project proposes to overcome these limitations by employing advanced computational techniques such as
deep learning, neural fields, and geometric modeling. These methods excel in extracting complex patterns from
medical images and enhancing the accuracy of morphometric analyses. Geometric deep learning adapts to the
neuroretina's geometric structures, offering novel insights into the optic nerve head and macula. Neural field
image registration enhances OCT image co-registration accuracy, crucial for longitudinal disease monitoring.
The project aims to revolutionize the diagnosis and management of optic neuropathies through three
interconnected objectives. The first aim is to employ deep generative models for mapping structure-function
relationships in optic neuropathies, focusing on predicting visual field outcomes and tracking disease progression
using advanced deep learning techniques. The second aim is to pioneer the next generation of retinal
morphometric OCT biomarkers using deep learning, enhancing the precision in identifying retinal changes and
improving the longitudinal analysis of optic nerve head and macular structures. Finally, the third aim is dedicated
to leveraging deep learning models for the classification of various types of optic neuropathies directly from
retinal OCT scans, aiming to significantly increase the accuracy and efficiency in distinguishing these conditions.
This research proposes a multidimensional strategy to significantly improve the diagnostic and management
capabilities in the field of neuro-ophthalmology through innovative applications of deep learning to OCT imaging.
By integrating advanced imaging techniques with deep learning models, it aims to unveil novel biomarkers and
predictive models, offering insights into the progression and treatment of these complex eye diseases. The
success of this project could lead to earlier detection, personalized treatment strategies, and ultimately, better
outcomes for patients with optic neuropathies."

Influenza viruses are a constant public health threat. Their high mutation rates, combined with a large number
of infections each year, generate novel variants; additionally, novel influenza viruses from animal reservoirs like
swine and wild birds can occasionally infect humans. Seasonal influenza viruses cause circa 500,000 deaths
annually, and pandemic influenza viruses have caused between 0.5-50 million deaths. However, despite the
acknowledged risk of pandemic influenza virus emergence, there are limited methods to assess the pandemic
potential of influenza strains. This proposal aims to develop two complementary methods to assess the risk of
novel influenza isolates, using mathematical modeling and evolutionary analyses. I hypothesize that these
approaches will prove useful in the estimation of important epidemiological parameters and in the quantification
of aggregate pandemic risk of IAV strains. The methods will leverage data already commonly gathered for
novel influenza viruses but broaden the applicability and increase the throughput of these established datasets
and approaches. In Aim 1, I will use data from experimental transmission studies in animal models to estimate
population-level epidemiological parameters. To do so, I will extend existing epidemiological approaches based
on serology to estimate the rates of onward transmission based on viral titers. This method allows for the
estimation of key parameters of interest, such as the basic reproduction number and the generation interval,
prior to virus establishment in humans. In Aim 2, I will use comparative evolutionary approaches to quantify
and predict pandemic risk. I will use phylogenetic comparative methods and ancestral and descendant state
analysis to estimate the pandemic risk of novel influenza viruses based on their evolutionary history. This
method would increase the speed with which risk assessments could be generated and would help to identify
key influenza gene segments that are important in predicting risk. Taken together, these methods will improve
our ability to accurately assess the pandemic risk of influenza isolates, which could help to improve public
health guidance, vaccine reformulations, and therapeutic development. Furthermore, such methods could be
easily extended to other viral pathogens of concern."

One in three adults over the age of 65 years has hearing loss, which has significant negative communicative,
cognitive, and social consequences. Although cochlear implants (Cls) restore access to sound, enormous
individual differences in effective speech communication - a hearing health behavior typically assessed clinically
with measures of speech recognition and hearing-related quality of life (HR-Qol) - are observed in adult Cl
users. Further, older adults are at greater risk for poor communication outcomes. Our long-term goal is to better
understand social networks and speech communication in new adult Cl users following rapid restoration of
hearing through Cls, and the social, cognitive, and linguistic processes that support effective speech
communication, in order to better understand underlying mechanisms and to guide clinical interventions. New
adult Cl users improve their communication ability largely through everyday interactions and relationships with
communication partners within their social networks. We propose that social networks represent important and
potentially malleable factors that contribute to the communication ability of adult Cl users. Broadly, adult Cl users
present a unique opportunity to study social parameters following rapid restoration of hearing. However, we do
not have a good understanding of how Cl use impacts social networks, both in terms of social network structure
and the interpersonal processes that occur within them, as well as how these social factors relate to
communication ability. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed research are to characterize the effects of Cl
use on social network structure and interpersonal processes in middle-aged and older adult Cl users following
implantation, and to assess in what ways and why individual differences in social networks relate to
communication outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that Cl use impacts both social network structure and
interpersonal processes, and that social networks and communication ability have a bi-directional relationship
over time. Aim 1 will characterize social network structure and processes among middle-aged and older adult Cl
users both prior to implantation and after 12 months of Cl use. We will also compare Cl users' social networks
to those of normal-hearing (NH) peers and evaluate the influence of age on social networks. Aim 2 will determine
the degree to which social network structure and processes explain long-term clinical communication outcomes
(i.e., speech recognition and HR-Qol) at 12 months of Cl use. Aim 3 will investigate cognitive compensation as
a potential mechanism underlying the longitudinal and bi-directional relationship between social networks and
speech recognition, over the first 12 months of Cl use. We will specifically evaluate the use of predictive sentence
context in sentence recognition and its relationship to social network structure across individual Cl users. The
proposed research will provide unique insights into the interplay between hearing loss, speech communication,
and social parameters, and will provide a scientific basis for the development of novel social network
interventions to optimize speech communication in older adults with hearing loss and Cls."

The elevated risk of language and reading disorders (as high as 60%) among children with isolated cleft of the
lip and/or palate (iCL/P) is a significant clinical concern, substantiated by research since the 1980’s. These
disabilities, while not in the range of intellectual dysfunction, do result in academic achievement problems and
lower rates of college attendance. Neuroimaging work in children, adolescents, and young adults with iCL/P
has identified an association between these deficits and patterns of aberrant neural development and disrupted
activation during reading tasks. The critical next step in this line of work is to determine the etiology of these
language deficits and the associated neural patterns. Current hypotheses postulate that deficits may be due to
events very early in life, including 1) repeated exposure to anesthesia, 2) airway obstruction/reduced
oxygenation, and 3) genetic/biological factors disrupting neural migration and brain development. To fully
evaluate these theories, imaging work needs to be done on infants before and after their first surgery, with
information on oxygenation, pre-speech functioning, and neural development obtained in tandem. The lack of
such research is a crucial gap in the field, precluding essential information needed to inform clinical decisions
that may improve these outcomes (e.g., treatment protocols and appropriate interventions).
In the proposed study, infants with iCL/P and unaffected controls will undergo assessment at 2, 6-8, and 14-16
months of age; providing pre- and post-surgery measures for infants with iCL/P. At each time point, innovative
techniques of brain imaging (through MRI and fNIRS) and multi-modal assessment of speech/language (vocal
recordings and clinical ratings) will be combined with continuous overnight pulse oximetry and systematic and
structured medical chart review (for information on anesthesia exposure, clinically mandated sleep studies,
medical interventions, and audiology assessments). Through an R56 (NIDCR), the PI and research team have
demonstrated feasibility of this protocol with baseline data on 16 participants to date. Initial data reflects
patterns of immature pre-speech development, disrupted cortical growth and activation, and more desaturation
events for those with iCL/P prior to exposure to anesthesia.
The current project aims to: 1) Use baseline data to assess the effects of cleft presence and overnight
desaturation events on brain structure/function and pre-speech/language measures before exposure to
anesthesia; 2) Use data from all timepoints to assess the longitudinal effects of desaturation events and
exposure to anesthesia on neural and language outcomes for patients with and without iCL/P; and 3) Evaluate
the relationship between measures of neural structure/function and language outcomes. The longitudinal
approach and novel measures of pre-speech and neural functioning will significantly contribute to the
understanding of development in infants with iCL/P and the impact of exposure to anesthesia and reduced
oxygenation."

Young adulthood is a critical period for alcohol initiation and changes in alcohol use patterns, including increased
risk for alcohol misuse and alcohol use disorders (AUD). Among young adults, social contexts are strong
determinants of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related consequences. As such, it is critical for research
studies to investigate social factors as mechanisms to understand future AUD risk in young adults. Rigorous
prior research has shown that an individual’s response to alcohol is greater when they are drinking with another
person compared to when they are drinking alone. We refer to this phenomenon as “social facilitation of alcohol
effects”. We propose social facilitation of alcohol effects may represent the rewarding aspects of social contexts
combined with alcohol-related rewarding effects to produce an additive rewarding experience. Social facilitation
of alcohol effects may be relevant to young adults, as this developmental period is marked by lifetime peaks in
alcohol use and heightened sensitivity to social factors. In Study 1, participants will complete 4 counterbalanced
lab sessions: alcohol (0.0 g/kg vs 0.8 g/kg) × social context (alone vs with friend). During each session,
participants will complete measures of affect and subjective alcohol effect prior to and following beverage
consumption. During social sessions, participants will also complete a standardized conversation task with
behavioral coding. The goal of Study 1 is to extend prior research characterizing the phenomenon of social
facilitation alcohol effects to investigate person-level predisposing factors to social facilitation alcohol effects and
mechanisms of social facilitation alcohol effects. Based on prior studies demonstrating that extraversion and
social alcohol expectancies may associate with greater social reward and positive alcohol effects, we propose
these as predisposing factors to social facilitation alcohol effects. Based on prior research demonstrating that
alcohol consumed in social settings increases affiliative behavior and emotional contagion (i.e., individual’s affect
can alter the affect of others in a coordinated manner), we propose increased agreeableness, emotional
responsiveness, and emotional contagion as mechanisms of social facilitation of alcohol effects. The same
participants will then complete Study 2, which includes 28-days of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
and 6- and 12-month follow ups. EMA will capture social context and EMA and follow-up will assess naturalistic
alcohol use outcomes (i.e., alcohol use, binge alcohol use, alcohol consequences). Study 2 will extend findings
by investigating the role of acute social alcohol response (i.e., social facilitation of alcohol effects measured in
Study 1) on future alcohol use and consequences. The combined EMA/longitudinal follow-up will allow for
granular assessment (including social context) of real-time alcohol use uncontaminated by retrospective recall
(EMA) and the ability to measure alcohol use patterns up to one year later (follow-up)."
10979275,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a significant global health problem and is expected to become the third
leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States (US). Among patients with early-stage HCC, approximately
70-80% of patients experience disease recurrence after surgical resection, and no systemic therapy is currently
approved in the perioperative setting. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy (immunotherapy administered prior to a
potentially curative HCC resection) aims to utilize the primary tumor as a source of antigens to enhance systemic
anti-tumor immunity and prevent disease recurrence. Neoadjuvant studies also offer an opportunity to interrogate
the mechanisms behind both tumor sensitivity and resistance to therapies by providing larger quantities of tumor
to enable in-depth profiling of the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) that is not possible with needle
biopsies. We are conducting a neoadjuvant platform study to evaluate multiple programmed cell death protein-
1 (PD1)-based combinations in HCC. The three study arms are nivolumab (NIVO, anti-PD1), NIVO plus
cabozantinib (CABO, a multi-kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-2, AXL, and c-MET), and NIVO plus relatlimab (RELA,
anti-Lymphocyte Activating 3, LAG3). Our overarching hypothesis is that the addition of CABO and RELA to anti-
PD1 will bypass barriers to recruitment and function of T cells in early-stage HCC. We will also investigate tertiary
lymphoid structures (TLS) as a conserved mechanism of response to neoadjuvant anti-PD1-based
immunotherapy, based on our preliminary data showing a strong association between the formation of TLS and
major pathologic response in HCCs treated with anti-PD1 immunotherapy. In Aim 1, we will utilize high-parameter
multiplex imaging mass cytometry (IMC) on pre-treatment and post-treatment surgical resection specimens to
determine the additive effects of CABO and RELA on the density and spatial relationships of immune cells within
the TiME. We will also evaluate whether the triple combination of CABO, anti-PD1, and anti-LAG3 enhances T
effector (Teff) recruitment, function, and survival in preclinical models of HCC. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
clonal dynamics of TLS that arise within anti-PD1 treated HCCs through T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor
(BCR) sequencing of individual lymphoid aggregates. We will determine the immunophenotype of TLS through
spatial and functional analysis of TLS-associated T cells and B cells. In Aim 3, we will determine the cellular
composition and organization of immunotherapy-associated TLS in three-dimensions by employing a new
technology (CODA) that renders 3D reconstruction of 2D image stacks. This aim will provide the first multicellular
structure-function analysis of TLS in immunotherapy-responsive HCC to understand if TLS are highly conserved
within tumors and across tumors. The final deliverable for this project is understanding the mechanisms of
response to promising anti-PD1 combinations, and the identification of effective and feasible therapeutic
combinations in the neoadjuvant setting for HCC that can be brought forward in larger studies to ultimately
improve outcomes for patients with early-stage HCC."
10979373,"Project Abstract: Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP) is an organophosphate flame retardant used
to meet federal and state flammability standards of various consumer products. Off-gassing causes TDCPP to
accumulate in dust and contaminate indoor spaces. TDCPP is stable in the environment, but when it enters the
body, which is most commonly via hand-to-mouth contact, TDCPP is readily metabolized to bis(1,3-dichloro-2-
propyl) phosphate (BDCPP). Ninety percent of Americans have detectable BDCPP in their urine, indicating
ubiquitous exposure. Studies utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found a
significant positive association between urinary BDCPP levels and metabolic syndrome, with the components
central adiposity and hyperglycemia carrying the association. Interestingly, the association with BDCPP and
metabolic syndrome was found only in men. We have developed a mouse model of TDCPP exposure that
reproduces male sex-specific metabolic disruption. TDCPP is incorporated into purified low phytoestrogen diets
to mimic the primary route of exposure in humans. When fed this diet, male wild-type mice have increased
percent body fat and insulin resistance. Euglycemic clamp showed insulin resistance was liver-specific. We
screened TDCPP in vitro for agonist activity against 26 nuclear receptors and found that TDCPP activates only
farnesoid X and pregnane X receptors (PXR). However, in livers of TDCPP-treated mice, only PXR target genes
were differentially expressed. Building upon our preliminary findings, our proposed studies will test the overall
hypothesis that PXR activation mediates male sex-specific TDCPP-induced hepatic insulin resistance. To
increase clinical translation of the proposed research, we will use transgenic mice expressing the human PXR
(hPXR) gene. Our preliminary studies show transgenic hPXR mice are at least 100x more sensitive to TDCPP-
induced metabolic disruption than wild-type mice. We will interrogate insulin action and signaling in livers of male
and female hPXR mice. Using PXR deficient mice and dietary exposure to BDCPP, which is not a PXR agonist,
we will determine whether PXR activation is necessary to confer metabolic disruption. We will gonadectomize
male and female mice to determine whether TDCPP-induced metabolic disruption is sex hormone-dependent.
Finally, to further elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of TDCPP's sex-specific metabolic disruption, we will
perform mRNA sequencing of livers from hPXR, PXR deficient, and castrated male and female mice exposed to
TDCPP. The proposed preclinical studies fill a critical emergent knowledge gap regarding whether the ubiquitous
environmental contaminant, TDCPP, promotes development of metabolic syndrome. Successful completion of
the proposed studies will drive future knowledge toward interventions and screening strategies to identify
metabolically innocuous flame retardants; and furthermore, progress our understanding of xenobiotic-mediated
sex differences, which may be generalizable to many other endocrine disrupting chemicals."

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a neurodegenerative disease found at autopsy that underlies a
variety of clinical dementia syndromes, and is the second most common cause of dementia under age 65 [1].
Patients with FTLD-related dementias are underserved in part because the complex relationship between
dementias and underlying pathology is not well understood. Much of the complexity lies in the fact that the same
pathology can cause different dementia syndromes and, conversely, that a single dementia syndrome can be
caused by multiple pathologies. The goal of this proposal is to disentangle the complex relationship between
dementia syndromes, anatomic atrophy, cell death, and a specific form of FTLD, known as FTLD-tau. In doing
so, this work will help identify the putative substrates of neurodegeneration in FTLD-tau.
This study focuses on a robust cohort of postmortem human specimens that show the most common forms of
FTLD-tau: Pick’s disease and the frontotemporal lobar tauopathies of the corticobasal and progressive
supranuclear palsy types (CBD-PSP). These tauopathies can underlie primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a
clinical dementia syndrome characterized by progressive language impairment, and behavioral variant
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a clinical dementia syndrome characterized by progressive changes in
comportment. Aim 1 will determine the specific targets and cellular features of a single tauopathy (Pick’s
disease) in cases diagnosed antemortem with different dementia syndromes: the semantic and agrammatic
variants of PPA (PPA-S and PPA-G, respectively) and bvFTD. These dementia syndromes are each associated
with distinct patterns of atrophy and clinical profiles, providing an ideal model to explore the selective
vulnerabilities of anatomic regions responsible for cognition or behavior. Aim 2 will study the converse
relationship by investigating multiple pathologies (Pick’s disease and CBD-PSP) in cases diagnosed antemortem
with a single dementia syndrome (PPA-G or bvFTD). Histological and unbiased stereological methods will be
used to determine relationships between FTLD-tau pathology, not only to detailed clinical profiles and
quantitative MRI atrophy patterns, but also to neuronal, glial, and synaptic abnormalities. A central hypothesis
of this work is that regional distributions of FTLD-tau—and related cellular features—will show concordance with
anatomic patterns of atrophy and distinct clinical profiles.
This is one of the first works of its kind that aims to establish clinical, anatomic, and pathologic concordance of
high specificity between clinical dementia syndromes and the tauopathies that cause them. PPA and bvFTD,
specifically, offer exciting opportunities for exploring the organization and pathologic targets of anatomic
networks in neurodegenerative diseases. Outcomes of this multidisciplinary study will clarify the pathologic
underpinnings of clinical heterogeneity in dementias, sharpen our understanding of the principles of selective
vulnerability, and are highly relevant for the development of tauopathy-specific diagnostic tools and treatments."
10995564,"Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis, but beyond the well described role of the NLRP3
inflammasome, the molecular genetic causes of gout flares is least well known among the arthropathies.
Published and preliminary results from our group have implicated genes associated with inflammation in gout
which do (e.g., TMEM176B) or may not (e.g, FADS2) relate directly to inflammasome activation. A powerful
approach for understanding the mechanistic basis of gout flares is through transcriptomic profiling of
mononuclear cells from the target organ of inflammation, the synovial fluid, but these studies have not been
rigorously carried out. We have designed a first of its kind, time-sensitive ancillary study, through the parent
clinical trial, Treat-to-Target vs Treat-to-Avoid-Symptoms (TRUST), which will allow novel comparisons of
candidate gene expression in mononuclear cells of synovial fluid to peripheral blood cells prior to and during
active gout flares. These studies will require consenting TRUST participants for arthrocentesis during active
flares. This additional, fresh biospecimen collection, facilitated by the TRUST trial, is highly time-sensitive and
crucial for thorough investigation of molecular mechanisms of gout flares. We will use these samples to carry
out Aim 1 - differential gene expression analysis of myeloid subsets before and during a flare in peripheral
blood and synovial fluid samples during active flare. Flow cytometry on samples from 20 individuals will be
used to isolate non-classical and classical monocytes followed by bulk RNA sequencing. Single cell RNAseq
will be done on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from five of the 20 individuals to infer
specific cell-types. In Aim 2, using our existing ex vivo cell culture paradigm we will stimulate PBMCs with LPS
and C18.0 fatty acid (FA) in the presence/absence of MSU crystals, followed by scRNAseq 24 hours post
stimulation. Cells will be isolated from fresh samples of blood collected from people with gout (intercritical)
enrolled at UAB. scRNAseq transcriptomes will be compared between unstimulated, C18.0 FA and LPS
stimulated cells. Readouts will allow mechanistic insight into gout flares that are TLR-agonist mediated and
related to potential gout flare triggers. Finally, we will knockdown candidate genes, by attenuating their
expression and then measure NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Altered expression of secreted IL-1β would
confirm their mechanistic role in gout flares. The proposed research is highly innovative by sampling, with
never before collections of matched samples of peripheral blood and synovial fluid, by analyses, novel
transcriptomic analyses of myeloid cells in samples and in an ex vivo system, and by design, leveraging
resources of the TRUST parent clinical design for this time-sensitive ancillary study. Our work will provide new
knowledge of genetically-based mechanisms of gout flares and aid in identification of new therapeutic targets."

 3 Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are long-lived immature cells that retain the potential to
 4 generate all blood cell lineages including erythroid, myeloid, and lymphoid. HSPC dysregulation is a major driver
 5 of myeloid malignancies including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). This disorder is a significant health
 6 problem with approximately 10,000 people per year diagnosed with MDS in the United States. The ATPase
 7 DEAD-box Helicase 41 (DDX41) gene is mutated in an inherited form of adult-onset MDS, providing a compelling
 8 model to investigate the mechanism of MDS progression. These mutations are heterozygous and loss-of-
 9 function, indicating that diminished DDX41 levels contribute to MDS etiology. Individuals with DDX41 mutations
10 take years to develop MDS, suggesting that features of aging contribute to the asymptomatic-to-smoldering
11 malignancy transition. Human and zebrafish DDX41 are highly conserved. Like humans, ddx41 heterozygous
12 zebrafish begin to display altered hematopoietic features such as elevated HSPC frequency, shifts in myeloid
13 cell composition, and dysplasia. These findings implicate aspects of aging contribute to disease evolution in our
14 model similar to humans. I hypothesize that environmental alterations synergize with genotype-specific factors
15 to promote HSPC dysfunction. Previously, we showed that HSPC expansion in homozygous ddx41 zebrafish
16 mutants during embryogenesis was driven by cGAS-STING activation. This pathway is associated with age-
17 driven inflammation; thus, we will test the hypothesis that aging and cGAS-STING activation could play a role in
18 age-associated HSPC expansion in ddx41 heterozygous animals. Neutrophils are also key regulators of HSPC
19 function. Aging and mutations in MDS-associated factors are linked with neutrophil dysfunction. We will test the
20 model that ddx41 heterozygosity alters neutrophil functions and that this dysfunction contributes to age
21 associated HSPC expansion. My findings have the potential to uncover new ways to prevent MDS progression
22 and will also provide valuable insight into fundamental mechanisms controlling HSPC homeostasis."

Background: Black sexual minority men (SMM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV and multiple social
determinants of health (SDOH), such as housing instability, unemployment, and criminal justice involvement,
which pose significant barriers to linkage, engagement, and retention in HIV care. Interventions to address these
intersecting factors are resource intensive and logistically challenging, and the best implementation strategies
remain unclear. Agent-based models (ABMs) can be used to virtually evaluate candidate interventions and
implementation strategies to facilitate more efficient and timely intervention development, and combined with
iterative community and public health stakeholder feedback can provide important insights about which
intervention strategies and implementation levers would be most effective and efficient in real-world settings.
Objective: Building on an existing ABM platform, this proposal will utilize multiple existing local data sources
and new data collected through qualitative interviews and focus groups to better understand barriers to linkage,
engagement, and retention in HIV care among Black SMM. We will combine methods from epidemiology, agent-
based modeling, and implementation science to understand the potential impact of strategies to increase
engagement and retention in HIV care on population-level HIV transmission. Methods: We will characterize
individual, clinical, and structural level barriers to engagement and retention in care, identify relevant
implementation levers, and use this information to simulate (Phase 1) and pilot (Phase 2) implementation
strategies to improve re-linkage, engagement, and retention in care among previously diagnosed individuals who
are not consistently engaged in care. Significance: A better understanding of where and how to focus efforts to
relink out of care individuals and to improve HIV care engagement and retention has the potential to have an
important impact on the HIV epidemic and reduce health inequities. Once developed, our methods and models
can be adapted to other geographic areas to reflect local prevention priorities and can serve as an example
application of implementation science and ABM methods to advance HIV prevention science."

Project Summary / Abstract
Now in its 22nd year of operation, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) was the first consortium
model, NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The consortium is comprised of 1,100 members from
five principal Harvard-affiliated hospitals and two Harvard health science schools: Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center (BIDMC), Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Dana-
Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health
(HSPH), and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Our overarching goals are to identify the genetic,
biological, environmental, and behavioral bases of cancer and to develop effective strategies to reduce risk
and improve preventive and treatment outcomes. Our catchment area is the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Our steady progress over the last two decades has depended on the combined resources and talent at the 7
institutions; the unique consortium structure that enables collaborative bench-to-bedside translational research
by population, basic, and clinical members; and well-coordinated Center leadership. DF/HCC embodies: 1) an
integrated structure that aspires to excellence in research and accelerates clinically effective discoveries, 2) a
cohesive research community for cross-institutional and transdisciplinary collaborations, and 3) a collectively
large patient population that expedites the conduct of innovative clinical trials. Our work occurs in 18 Research
Programs that cross scientific and institutional boundaries and span the gamut of population, basic, and clinical
cancer research; members excel in each sphere. Two entities, a Center for Cancer Equity and Engagement
(CCEE) and an Office for Cancer Research Education and Training (OCRET), help fulfill our responsibilities to
the catchment area and to train future leaders in cancer research. The Center supports 14 Shared Resources
that provide members with quality research services that cannot easily be duplicated in individual laboratories
or institutions. A unified clinical research infrastructure serves all seven consortium institutions and makes it
possible for members to conduct innovative early-phase (proof-of-concept and Phase I/II) clinical trials across
the consortium. A portfolio of grants that transcend organizational and disciplinary boundaries (e.g., SPOREs,
Program Projects, SU2C Dream Teams) reflect our collective translational and collaborative ideals.
Our next phase of work is guided by a multi-part Strategic Plan that emphasizes mechanistic understanding of
cancer, early cancer detection, equity, new therapeutic avenues, and a renewed commitment to education and
mentorship. Underlying these goals are a culture and infrastructure streamlined for collaborative investigation
of populations, fundamental cellular and molecular mechanisms, primary tumor specimens, and the barriers to
improved cancer-related outcomes in all segments of society."

The human cerebral cortex supports extraordinary cognitive capacities, including unmatched social and
technological complexity, elaborate cultural traditions, and language. It also plays a central role in diverse brain
disorders that cause profound human suffering, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's dementia, that may
have only limited analogs in non-human species. One key adaptation is the dramatic expansion of the cortical
sheet vs other primates, particularly in higher cognitive (association) areas. This expansion is not uniform, but it
has proven challenging to accurately map the degree of expansion in different regions and to determine the
relative contributions of expansion of evolutionarily conserved areas vs the emergence of new areas. Recent
methodological advances make it feasible to generate substantially more accurate cortical expansion maps than
heretofore possible. Evolutionary divergence in cortical organization presumably reflects changes in gene
expression patterns responsible for the differentiation of cortical areas and the determination of areal size.
Recent advances in spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics have led to the discovery of hundreds of
putative cell types whose diversity is a critical substrate of brain evolution. In this proposal both sets of advances
will be leveraged to address both evolutionary expansion and transcriptomic cell type divergence in human vs
macaque cortex. The proposed analyses will be empowered by active collaboration with multiple consortia,
including the Non-human Primate Neuroimaging & Neuroanatomy Project (NHP-NNP), and the Human and
Mammalian Brain Atlas (HMBA), a facet of the BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network. State-of-the-art interspecies
registration will be performed by integrating putative homologous regions, myelin maps, and resting state
networks to derive a substantially more accurate map of the evolutionary expansion of the cortex in macaque vs
human than has previously been reported. Comparing this map and other brain maps to patterns of transcription
in humans and macaques will allow testing of whether (1) evolutionary expansion has a distinct transcriptional
signature from other brain measures, (2) this signature is more evident in cell type distribution than in aggregate
gene expression, and (3) human-enriched cell types (e.g., in layer 4) play a prominent role in cortical expansion
and diversification. Accurately registered transcription and neuroimaging measures will provide new evidence
for distinguishing evolutionally emergent areas from conserved areas that have undergone evolutionary
expansion. Taken together, the proposed research will augment the translational potential of studies utilizing
non-human primate models, enhance our understanding of the areal and cellular substrates of the complex
behaviors, and provide new insights into possible mechanisms of primarily human mental and neurological
disorders."

 The World Health Organization (WHO) defines five broad groups of pulmonary hypertension (PH),
including PH resulting from chronic lung diseases and/or conditions causing hypoxia (WHO Group III).
Regardless of etiology, central features include increased pulmonary arterial constriction and remodeling.
Unfortunately, current therapies lack pulmonary vasculature specificity and do not address the prominent
pulmonary arterial remodeling; nonetheless, rates of morbidity and mortality for patients with PH remain high.
Our laboratory has identified a pathogenic role of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) in rodent models of
chronic hypoxia (CH)-induced PH. The prominent role of ASIC1a is independent of changes in gene or protein
expression. Rather, subcellular localization of ASIC1a in PASMC is altered, wherein plasma membrane-localized
ASIC1a (pmASIC1a) is increased and mitochondria-localized ASIC1a (mtASIC1a) is decreased. Following CH,
enhanced activation of pmASIC1a causes increased Na+ and Ca2+ influx, which are associated with pulmonary
arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC) dysfunction during PH. However, both the physiological role and the effect
of the loss of mtASIC1a on PASMC function are unknown. Our preliminary data shows that the loss of Asic1a
results in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) hyperpolarization and decreased caspase activation.
Lentiviral transduction of PASMC from Asic1a knockout mice with mtASIC1a prevents ΔΨm hyperpolarization.
Considering that ΔΨm hyperpolarization is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis resistance,
these data suggest an important role of mtASIC1a for PASMC function.
 Defining the mechanisms of ASIC1a trafficking may provide novel molecular targets to improve PASMC
function during PH. Interestingly, we show that the ASIC1a-binding molecular chaperone, sigma-1 receptor
(σ1R), is upregulated in intrapulmonary arteries following CH. Moreover, we show that the σ1R antagonist,
S1RA, decreases pmASIC1a localization and the σ1R agonist, PRE-084, increases ASIC1a-dependent Ca2+
influx. The proposed studies will test the central hypothesis that σ1R causes altered subcellular localization of
ASIC1a following CH that results in aberrant PASMC function associated with PH. The following aims will be
investigated to test this hypothesis: 1) Determine the contribution of σ1R to the enhanced localization and
activation of pmASIC1a following CH and 2) Define the role of σ1R in mtASIC1a localization and mitochondrial
function. The significance of this research lies in defining the role of σ1R in regulating ASIC1a subcellular
localization, which controls PASMC function. This study also examines the novel role of ASIC1a to regulate
mitochondrial function. These findings address the unmet need for more effective pulmonary hypertension
therapies. Moreover, this training plan will positively impact my technical, analytical, and communication skills
which will propel me to attain a postdoctoral fellowship studying vascular physiology."
10996663,"In this proposal, we aim to address a critical challenge in lung transplantation: primary graft dysfunction (PGD),
a severe complication impacting over half of all lung transplant recipients and have a particularly high incidence
in those with pre-existing acute lung injuries (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite lung
transplantation being a life-saving treatment for end-stage lung diseases, the high incidence of PGD significantly
diminishes the long-term success and survival rates of these procedures. Our research is grounded in the
discovery of the pivotal role played by intravascular nonclassical monocytes (NCM) in the donor lungs, which
are activated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), especially high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1),
initiating the cascade leading to PGD.
Building on this foundation, our proposal hypothesizes that receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-
dependent necroptosis in both the recipient's native lungs and the donor lungs is a key driver of PGD. This
hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data, which shows a sustained necroptotic process in the diseased
lungs of recipients, particularly in cases of ALI and ARDS. We propose two specific aims to test this hypothesis:
 1. Exploration of Autocrine Necroptosis in Recipient Lungs: The first aim focuses on the role of TNF-α
 induced autocrine necroptosis in monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages within the acutely injured
 native lungs. We plan to investigate the release of HMGB1 as a result of this necroptosis and how it
 contributes to the activation of donor-derived NCM during lung transplantation. This study will provide
 insights into the mechanisms through which pre-transplant lung conditions exacerbate the risk of PGD.
 2. Investigation of Necroptosis in Donor Lungs: The second aim targets the necroptosis in donor lung
 tissue, specifically induced by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the transplantation
 process. We aim to identify the cell populations in the lung responsible for mitochondrial ROS generation
 in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury and delineate their role in the necroptotic process within the
 graft. This understanding is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the risk of PGD arising
 from donor tissue conditions.
The overarching goal of this research is to comprehensively understand and pharmacologically target the
necroptotic pathways in both the donor and recipient lungs to reduce the incidence of PGD. This could positively
impact the field of lung transplantation by significantly improving post-transplant outcomes. The successful
completion of this research could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies and biomarkers for
predicting and managing PGD, thereby enhancing patient survival and quality of life following lung
transplantation."
10999153,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 The neuroscientific understanding of alcohol use disorder (AUD) has advanced tremendously over the
past three decades. However, translation from preclinical models to clinical studies lags behind the evolving
neuroscience literature. Two of the most prominent neurobiological models of addiction are the allostatic model
and the incentive-sensitization model. The allostatic model focuses on the transition from positive to negative
reinforcement as addiction progresses. The incentive-sensitization model also emphasizes dynamic processes
in addiction and focuses primarily on the transition from ‘liking’ to ‘wanting’ a substance. Given that the clinical
application of these two prominent models is underway, understanding the forward translation (pre-clinical to
clinical) of these neurobiological models is more important than ever before. Moreover, identifying
demographic moderators of the interaction between these models is a crucial next step in understanding the
potential application of these findings in treatment development. Further, these two prominent neurobiological
models are being used to inform precision medicine approaches even though the predictive utility of these
models on alcohol consumption is limited. Therefore, innovative methodology is necessary to increase the
translational efficacy of neurobiological models to human clinical samples. This proposal is based on recent
indications that there is an interactive effect between the allostatic model and incentive-sensitization model.
Specifically, a preliminary study in the Sponsor’s laboratory focused on the allostatic model and incentive-
sensitization model. Their combined effect showed that there is an interactive effect of negative mood and cue
exposure on drinking among individuals with AUD. The objective of this NRSA application is to foster the
applicant’s development as a clinical scientist with a focus on neurobiological models of addiction, translational
science of addiction, and quantitative methods. This proposal aims to fill the gap in the literature by examining
the interaction between the allostatic model and incentive-sensitization model, identifying moderators of this
interaction, and testing the predictive utility of these models. Specifically, Aim #1 tests the effects of negative
mood and cue exposure on same-day alcohol craving and alcohol use. Aim #2 tests the predictive effects of
the allostatic model and incentive-sensitization model on longitudinal alcohol use. Exploratory Aim tests
demographic moderators of the relationship between negative mood and cue reactivity. To address these Aims
64 individuals (32 females) with current AUD (mild to severe) will complete daily diary assessments of mood,
craving, cue-exposure, and drinking for 14 days and will complete remote follow-up visits at 4, 8, and 12-weeks
post daily diary. A sophisticated analytic approach including longitudinal multilevel modeling and multilevel
moderation will be used to test these aims. The present study represents an important step in furthering the
translation of neurobiological constructs of AUD and, with the support of the mentoring team, the applicant’s
scientific development as an independent researcher with an interest in translational science of addiction."
10978532,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Deafness at birth frequently originates from defects in the development of sensory cells in the inner ear. Likewise,
hearing degradation during life frequently follows damage sustained by these cells after normal development. In
each case, a particularly susceptible cellular compartment is the hair bundle, a specialized structure in each
sensory cell that detects and relays sound-borne vibrations. The hair bundle is an array of actin-based membrane
protrusions, or stereocilia, precisely organized in rows of graded heights. Although the tiered architecture of the
hair bundle is fundamental for sensory function, the molecular machinery required for its assembly during
development and for the maintenance of its exact dimensions during life remains obscure. To address these
open questions, we propose to exploit knowledge gained from our ongoing investigations of the GPSM2-Gαi
protein complex in mouse. Absence of the scaffold protein GPSM2 or inhibitory G proteins (Gαi) result in
defective hair bundle assembly, a likely etiology for congenital hearing loss in Chudley-McCullough syndrome.
The GPSM2-Gαi protein complex is first enriched on one side of the nascent hair bundle only (the bare zone),
and then enriched at the tip of stereocilia in the adjacent first row, a distribution required for proper stereocilia
placement and elongation, respectively. We showed that the Myosin-15A motor transports GPSM2-Gαi to
stereocilia tips, where in turn GPSM2-Gαi increases Myosin-15A amounts compared to other rows to define the
tallest identity of the first row. Based on detailed preliminary data, we hypothesize that, 1) As yet unstudied Gαi
regulators act as upstream cues to selectively enrich the GPSM2-Gαi complex only in the bare zone region of
the apical membrane and only in a single row of stereocilia. 2) Prior GPSM2-Gαi enrichment on one side of the
nascent hair bundle is the mechanism by which GPSM2-Gαi becomes restricted to abutting stereocilia in the
first row, giving the hair bundle its tiered architecture. 3) Continued enrichment of GPSM2-Gαi at stereocilia tips
after development has a role in maintenance of proper stereocilia height and girth in adult hair bundles. To test
these hypotheses, we will: 1) Characterize the role of a negative Gαi protein regulator that we already established
as a new deafness gene critical for GPSM2-Gαi complex localization and hair bundle morphogenesis. 2) Use a
new chemical protein labeling technology and new reporter mouse models to track discrete pools of GPSM2-
Gαi and follow their dynamic trafficking to the bare zone and stereocilia tips in time. 3) Inactivate GPSM2-Gαi
function in structurally and functionally normal hair bundles in adults, and monitor stereocilia dimensions,
stereocilia actin dynamics and mouse auditory function. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms that shape
and preserve hair bundles will help interpret and design treatments for sensory cell dysfunction, the principal
cause of hearing loss."

0 and reduced GVHD. Ko mice had accelerated GVHD; IL-33 given pre-BMT prevented the full lLC2 loss. IL-33
ko recipients have hypo-proliferative epithelial cells, reduced ISCs and Paneth cells, and smaller crypt height
and numbers. Ex vivo intestine organoid culture modeling revealed that IL-33 coordinated regeneration by
inducing epidermal growth factor (EGF), significantly reduced by TBI. EGF restored ISC deficiency, uncovering
a gut repair IL-33/EGF loop between ISCs and Paneth cells. Donor IL-13 ko ILC2s or host IL 13Ra ko mice had
reduced GVHD. ILC2 IL 13 supports both ST2+ tuft cells and goblet cells. Tuft cells produce IL-25 driving ILC2
production and survival. TBI markedly reduced tuft cells for :!:38 days and ko recipients had a striking increase
in GVHD. When given to wildtype mice exogenous IL-25 significantly reduced GVHD. Consequences of ko of
tuft cells (and ILC2s) on donor T cell expansion, trafficking and function are unknown. The role of IL-25 and
IL 17RB has not been examined. We will address the dynamics and interplay between ILC2, IL-33 and
host intestinal cells (tuft cells, ISCs, Paneth cells) after TBI and during GVHD.
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that: Donor ILC2 repopulation fails due to destruction of ILC2 BM niche
that supports ILC2s. In vitro pre-lLC2 differentiation, maturation and expansion ± proinflammatory
cytokines and ILC2 supporting cytokines will be studied. GATA3-GFPhi pre-lLC2s/mature ILC2s transfer
into lethally irradiated congenic BMT recipients will provide data on the differential ability to repopulate the
BM. If the BM cannot support pre-lLC2s/lLC2s, we will study stem cell deficient mice. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that: Pre-lLC2s/lLC2s and their secreted products have direct effects on intestinal cell subsets.
Intestinal organoid cultures from wild-type and IL-33 ko mice with syngeneic Tregs and ILC2s will measure
organoid size, number, and gene expression related to proliferation, cell cycle regulation, and specific
epithelial lineage markers under homeostasis or after TBI. Anti-AREG mAbs or co-cultures with AREG ko
lymphocytes will be characterized for promoting epithelial regeneration. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that: Tuft
cells are essential for ILC2 development and survival via an ILC2 release of IL-13 that stimulates tuft cells to
release IL-25 that causes ILC2 proliferation (aim 3). Tuft cell and ILC2 ko hosts have accelerated GVHD. We
hypothesize that IL-25 effects are due to direct stimulation of ILC2s or alternatively, with donor IL-17RB+ T
cells.
Significance. Studies in the R37 extension phase will provide fundamental information as to the mechanisms
by which peri-BMT IL-33 diminish GVHD lethality via effects on ST2+ host ILC2s and regulatory T cells,
both of which produce AREG, and the EGF/IL-33 loop that occurs between ISCs and Paneth cells resulting in
small intestine repair. Further, the key role of host ILC2s in subduing GVHD, the nature of post-BMT ILC2
deficiency that occurs after pre-BMT conditioning regimens and predisposes patients to GVHD, and the
essential requirement for tuft cells or their product, IL-25 will be elucidate. LasUy, critical insights will be
gained as to the inability of pre-lLC2s generation, gut migration or differentiation.
Translational Impact: The efficacy of donor and third-party ILC2 infusion in preventing and treating GVHD
support our planned human ILC2 clinical trial, funded via other auspices, that will infuse ""off-the-shelf' third
party ILC2s to treat steroid refractory gut GVHD, that portends a particularly poor prognosis, in a 2-
institutional study at the University of Minnesota and UNC-CH."

The goal of the ITM CTSA KL2 Scholar program is to produce accomplished researchers capable of utilizing
the tools of clinical and translational research to improve the understanding or treatment of human disease.
Research topics can relate to any aspect of clinical and/or translational research and to any patient population
or disease group. Any suitable research approach can be employed. However, relevance to the understanding
or treatment of human disease must be demonstrated. In ITM 3.0, we will particularly emphasize the impact of
health disparities during the training of our KL2 Scholars across the translational research spectrum, so that
they are able to consider issues related to different groups (such as race, ethnicity, SES, gender, age,
communication strategies for these different audiences, etc.) and sociome factors (social, environmental,
behavioral, and psychological), and account for these in complex intersectional designs and approaches.
Our program's track record demonstrates a high degree of success in supporting junior faculty to successful
academic research careers. Since inception of our KL2 program in 2008, we have had or currenUy have 30
Scholars in our program. Of these 30 Scholars, 13 (43%) have transitioned to R01 or comparable funding with
several still likely to make this transition in the near term. This demonstrates the ability of our program to
produce Scholars with high-impact, innovative research that aligns well with the emerging directions at NIH
and in the scientific community. While 20% of our Scholars to date self-identify as underrepresented
minorities, in ITM 3.0 we will further increase our effort to attract Scholars from underrepresented backgrounds.
We anticipate supporting ~2 years of multidisciplinary training for each selected junior faculty member, who will
devote >/=75% effort to investigation and training (>/=50% for surgeons). The program will include five KL2
Scholars at any time {drawn primarily from UChicago and Rush, but occasionally from other ITM affiliates), and
its impact will be extended greatly beyond this relatively small number through co-training and extensive
interactions with K Scholars in other career development programs at the lead ITM institutions (UChicago and
Rush University) and its affiliates as well as with inclusion of numerous individual K-award (or equivalent)
recipients and K-award aspirants at all ITM institutions."
10976643,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hispanic older adults are 1.5 times more likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)
compared to White older adults. Social and built environments (SBE) are social determinants of health linked to
late-life cognitive function and ADRD risk. Detrimental neighborhood SBE are unevenly distributed across
populations and disproportionately affect minoritized groups including US Hispanic populations. Research is
growing on neighborhood SBE and ADRD among Hispanic populations, but few studies have investigated their
life course neighborhood SBE and how SBE-ADRD associations differ depending on place of birth. In this study,
we will use data on Hispanic participants from the Healthy Brain Initiative (HBI), a longitudinal cohort study of
≥50-year-olds without dementia from the racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse South Florida region.
This study aims to: (1) characterize life course neighborhood SBE (e.g., access to greenspace, socioeconomic
status) and how they differ between individuals born in and outside the US; (2) determine whether associations
between life course neighborhood SBE exposures and late-life ADRD outcomes vary depending on place of birth
(in or outside US) and percentage of life lived in the US; and (3) conduct semi-structured interviews with ~25
Hispanic older adults to develop a richer understanding of neighborhood environments and associated health
behaviors and exposures experienced throughout the life course and how they differ between those born in and
outside the US. Primary data collection will include administration of a questionnaire on neighborhood SBE from
childhood, young adulthood, midlife and late life and semi-structured interviews of HBI participants. In ArcGIS,
residential addresses will be geocoded and linked to satellite imagery and Area Deprivation Index data to
characterize participants’ neighborhood socioeconomic status and greenspace access. The questionnaire and
GIS data will be merged with cognitive (i.e., Cognivue global cognition score and cognitive domains such as
episodic memory) and magnetic resonance imaging data (i.e., hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity
volume and total brain volume in AD regions of interest). We hypothesize that life course neighborhood SBE
exposures and their associations with ADRD outcomes will vary by place of birth and percentage of life lived in
the US, and through the semi-structured interviews, we will develop possible explanations for any observed
differences that can be tested in subsequent studies. Our study will contribute significantly to the nascent body
of research on the impact of acculturation and neighborhood SBE on ADRD risk among Hispanic populations.
Study findings will be used to inform novel instrument development on important neighborhood SBE for
immigrant and Hispanic populations and key neighborhood SBE features to measure in future grant funded
studies on Hispanic ADRD disparities to ultimately inform community-level interventions for these populations."
10977913,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Inherited mutations in sarcomeric genes, which decrease cardiac myocyte tension generation, are principal
drivers of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)– the leading cause of heart failure. Progress towards developing
precision therapeutics for and defining the underlying determinants of DCM has been entirely cardiac myocyte
centric with negligible attention directed towards fibroblasts despite their role in regulating the best predictor of
DCM severity, cardiac fibrosis. Our recent findings in a mouse model of inherited DCM demonstrated that prior
to the onset of fibrosis and dilated myocyte remodeling both the myocardium and extracellular matrix (ECM)
stiffen from enhanced collagen fiber alignment and expansion of the cardiac fibroblast population, which was
reversed by blocking cardiac fibroblast function with targeted genetic silencing of p38. This cardiac fibroblast-
targeted intervention unexpectedly improved the primary cardiac myocyte defects in contractile function and
reversed ECM and dilated myocardial remodeling. Together these findings challenge the long-standing paradigm
that ECM remodeling is a secondary complication to inherited defects in myocyte contractile function and instead
demonstrate cardiac fibroblasts play an unequivocal role in DCM outcomes. As an extension of this work we
propose the overarching hypothesis that atypical p38-mediated fibroblast adaptations to DCM-linked sarcomere
mutations are irreversible with myocyte-centric approaches, owing to the disproportionate expansion of
sensitized and hyperresponsive Periostin+ fibroblasts during postnatal development that when left functionally
enabled by myocyte-targeted therapies leave inherited DCM hearts vulnerable to heightened fibrosis. This
hypothesis will be tested with the following aims: [Aim 1] Examine the developmental & molecular basis for
adaptive cardiac fibroblast expansion in an inherited DCM mouse model; [Aim 2] Examine the effectiveness of
myocyte versus fibroblast-targeted genetic interventions at various stages of DCM disease progression; and
[Aim 3] Examine the generalizability of p38-dependent cardiac fibroblast response to inherited & acquired DCM.
Outcomes from this work will start to resolve unknown fibroblast-based mechanisms that link primary myocyte
defects with the DCM disease process and identify whether therapeutic interventions for DCM may require
fibroblast-specific strategies to be effective."

The cornea is the optically clear, curved tissue that provides the majority of refractive power in
the eye. Improper healing of corneal wounds is a serious issue that can lead to blindness or
permanent refractive visual complications. We have demonstrated that the cornea becomes
intrinsically photoreceptive after injury, and it is able to entrain its circadian clock to light cycles
in vitro. We have observed that the rate healing of wounded mouse corneas is accelerated by
violet light both in vivo and ex vivo. We have identified a class of highly motile Opn5-expressing
epithelial cells induced in the cornea after wounding. Opn5 is an opsin protein which is sensitive
to short wavelength light. Mice which lack Opn5 show aberrant responses to corneal wounding,
such as impaired re-epithelialization and stromal abnormalities. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that light modulates corneal wound healing via an Opn5-dependent mechanism. We
have also found evidence of non-photic effects mediated by Opn5. The specific aims of this
project include the following: (Aim 1) testing the light regimen necessary for photic healing
acceleration in murine corneas, (Aim 2) characterizing the mechanism of signal transduction
within Opn5-expressing cells, and (Aim 3) testing the hypothesis that diffusible factors function
in the induction of Opn5 expression and its communication with the rest of the cornea. Our
approach will be to utilize both in vivo and ex vivo experimentation with a number of mouse
models in which the Opn5 cells can be visualized or have their molecular constituents isolated
from whole corneal cell lysate. We will also use cultured cell lines to uncover the factor or
factors necessary to induce Opn5. The innovation of this project lies in applying recently
discovered extra-retinal photoreception to analyses of wound healing and the health of the
corneal surface. Another aspect of this innovation will be to extend the results of mouse studies
to corneal cells from human and non-human primates to analyze the translational potential of
the observations made in mouse models. The potential impact of this work will be to harness the
role light plays in corneal wound healing through opsin agonists/ antagonists to facilitate wound
closure and the avoidance of scarring."
10976994,"Summary
 Stem cell (SC)-based replacement therapy is emerging as promising cure for diabetes.
However, population-wide applicability of this approach remains constrained by the limited
efficiency of current protocols in controlling the state of pluripotency and/or patient-specific
propensity of SC lines to respond to morphogens and inductive factors, thereby yielding
heterogenous islet cell preparations containing variable proportions of endocrine and immature
cell types.
 In this RC2 project we integrate knowledge from a team of Investigators with a complementary
expertise to exploit the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-designed mini-proteins (EpiBinders) in
controlling SC ability to more efficiently differentiate into functional islet cells. This approach is
based on our recent work demonstrating that EpiBinders are capable of erasing repressive
histone methylation marks and activate select genes of interest, thus fostering the activation of
downstream developmental programs. Building on this preliminary work, our hypothesis is that
the newly discovered regulatory function of AI-designed EpiBinders on gene expression can be
harnessed to drive a more efficient differentiation of multiple SC lines into functional islet tissue.
Hence our collaborative project will focus on the following specific aims: Aim 1. Develop and in-
cell validate a toolbox of Al-designed mini-proteins targeting epigenetic regulators of islet cell
development and function beyond PRC2 inhibitor in multiple iPSC lines. Aim 2. Apply and validate
the toolbox of EpiBinders for the regulation of islet cell development and function at specific stages
of SC differentiation. Aim 3. Characterize states of differentiation, functional maturation and
metabolic endurance of epigenetically manipulated SC-derived islet cells, in vitro and in vivo in
transplantation models.
 We anticipate that our interdisciplinary efforts will produce new knowledge and resources that
will be readily shared with the scientific community, and that will advance collective efforts to
broaden the future therapeutic potential of SC-based treatments by developing a radically new
approach to enhance efficiency of islet tissue derivation from SC."
10976995,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are rare and understudied heterogeneous tumors that are detrimental
to health causing increased mortality and poor quality of life. Cushing’s disease (CD) is a serious endocrine
disease caused by an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting PitNET that subsequently stimulates the
adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol. Chronic exposure to excess cortisol has several detrimental effects on
health, including increased stroke rates, diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, and a threefold increase in the
risk of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer. Despite decades of research, current treatments for CD
remain suboptimal, and the development of targeted therapies is challenging due to the limited knowledge of
PitNET tumor cellular and molecular complexity. The RC2 will fund the National Biorepository and Resource
for Pituitary Neuroendocrine Tumor Translational Research (BioPitNeT) which will be an open source,
clinically relevant deep tumor phenotyping platform and biorepository. This is the first phase of a contin-
uum of translational- and hypothesis-driven research that will accelerate the development of effective therapies
for PitNETs, preventing tumor recurrences and improving remission rates and quality of life for patients. The
BioPitNeT team will: 1) establish a large-scale unique resource within an infrastructure that will generate sus-
tainable novel research tools benefiting investigators with focused translational research of PitNETs, and 2)
implement interdisciplinary approaches and expertise to generate a resource that will foster translational and
hypothesis-driven research in PitNET diseases. The Registry for Adenomas of the PItuitary and related Disor-
ders (RAPID) is a twelve center US consortium founded in 2021 to improve treatment of patients with PitNETs
and funded by grateful patients. The BioPitNet leverages the RAPID Consortium clinical platform to combine
clinical annotations of future prospectively enrolled patients with molecular and pathological information using
state-of-the-art preclinical models. The low incidence of CD requires multicenter collaboration and interdiscipli-
nary team science partnerships between basic- and clinician-translational scientists comprising the expertise of
professionals trained in complimentary fields including medical and surgical treatment, neuropathology, molec-
ular genetics of PitNETs, molecular pathology and high-plex spatial imaging, organoid and iPSC technology,
canine comparative oncology disease models and translational bioinformatics. The BioPitNeT will be estab-
lished by the successful completion of Aim 1: To establish the BioPitNeT centralized biorepository comprising
of resources that will be benchmarked to the patients’ PitNET tissue of origin, Aim 2: To develop a PitNET
clinically relevant classification system for CD, and Aim 3: To establish a biobank of induced pluripotent stem
cell (iPSCs) lines genetically engineered to model corticotroph subtype PitNETs as a resource for investigating
genetic underlying mechanisms of CD."
10977149,"The methods used to measure NAD+ and NADH in human samples include the enzymatic cycling assay, high
pressure liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The LC-
MS/MS method offers superior sensitivity, precision, accuracy compared to the other methods. However, all
current methods suffer from one or more limitations: 1) some sample processing methods use strong acids
(e.g., trichloroacetic acid or perchloric acid) which degrade NADH and NADPH; 2) separate methods are often
used to measure oxidized and reduced pyridine nucleotides which poses a barrier to measuring the full
spectrum of NAD+-related metabolites; 3) scarcity of stable isotope-labeled internal standards for NAD+-related
metabolites that are imperative for precise quantification of analytes; 4) Commutable reference materials used
to calibrate assays and provide accuracy, metrological traceability, and comparability of measurements by
different laboratories are not available, nor are there mechanisms to harmonize assays across laboratories.
We propose two integrated aims to fill these methodological gaps. In Aim 1 we will (a) optimize and validate
standardized sample collection and storage protocols that will preserve the integrity of the pools of NAD+,
NADH, NADP, NADPH and related metabolites; (b) finalize the validation of our advanced LC/MS-MS method
(NADome Quant) that simultaneously measures this set of metabolites in human tissues; and (c) in
collaboration with Dr. Vesper's laboratory at the CDC, generate higher order commutable reference standards
and establish processes for harmonizing assays across laboratories. In Aim 2, we will conduct a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (n=90) to determine whether oral administration of β nicotinamide
mononucleotide (NMN), an immediate NAD+ precursor, is more efficacious effective than placebo in raising
myocardial NAD+ levels and reducing myocardial injury in adults undergoing elective coronary artery bypass
graft (CABG) surgery. Patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to placebo or to one of two dosing regimens of NMN
(administered for seven vs. two days prior to surgery) to test whether NMN administration increases
myocardial concentrations of NAD+ and its metabolites and attenuates myocardial and extracardiac (e.g.,
kidney) injury. CABG surgery offers a unique opportunity to harvest a variety of human tissue that would
otherwise be discarded, including myocardium, aortic endothelium, subcutaneous fat, and skin.
This research proposal will establish robust sample collection and storage protocols that preserve NAD+ as
well as NADH and NADP(H); more advanced LC/MS assays for measuring NAD+ and related metabolites; and
commutable reference materials and procedures for harmonizing assays across laboratories through the
auspices of the CDC. The proof-of-concept trial will provide key foundational data to guide the design of larger
efficacy trials of NAD+ augmentation strategies for preventing myocardial and extracardiac injury during CABG
surgery, an important unmet clinical need."

The University of Southern California (USC) CLIMAte-Related Exposures, Adaptation, and Health Equity
(CLIMA) Center’s Methods Development Research Core (MDRC) will address current modeling and data gaps
that are critically important to inform climate action policy for health equity. Climate hazards are not only
increasing separately, but they are also more likely to occur concurrently or consecutively as compound events,
challenging the adaptive capacity of systems and human resiliency to withstand their effects. These
dependencies lead to more complex and correlated patterns of climate-induced exposures which are also not
equally distributed and require new and transdisciplinary methods to accurately capture their distribution in space
and time with high resolution and assess their risks at varying scales. Given the increasing complexity and
transdisciplinary nature of climate change (CC) and health research, and the multitude of intertwined CC-induced
exposures, this Core has the potential to significantly advance modeling capabilities and inform policymakers
with early, real-life evidence on the effectiveness and gaps of adaptation strategies to strengthen CC resiliency,
especially in the face of emerging threats from less well-understood compound events. Early lessons learned
can inform local, regional, and global solution-oriented research and policy for climate health equity. The MDRC
will be guided by the following aims: (1) develop cutting-edge, high spatiotemporal resolution models to
accurately characterize climate-related environmental exposures (urban heat islands, wildfire smoke plumes),
vulnerability factors (power outages), and adaptation strategies (air conditioning penetration, tree canopy shade);
(2) leverage these improved, fine-scale models to inform where adaptation interventions are most needed based
on the intersection of climate-induced exposures, population vulnerability, and adaptive capacity (Environmental
Justice cumulative burden (CalEnviroScreen)); natural disaster preparedness (Social Vulnerability Index); and
climate vulnerability (Climate Vulnerability Index) in partnership with the Community Engagement Core (CEC);
and (3) explore transdisciplinary frameworks and build capacity towards modeling cumulative impacts of CC-
related compound events on exposures, adaptation vulnerabilities, and cardiovascular health and resilience
across the life course (in partnership with the Research Projects)."

Significance: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ+)
populations make up a substantial proportion of the United States (US) population—over 23 million individuals.
LGBTQ+ populations throughout the US face identity-related stigma, ranging from interpersonal to structural,
that leads to a variety of physical, mental, and economic health disparities. At the same time, the rising costs of
cancer care puts over half of cancer survivors at risk of financial hardship and the subsequent outcomes—poor
quality of life and reduces access to care. Emerging research suggests that LGBTQ+ cancer survivors and
caregivers may experience worse financial hardship in comparison to non-LGBTQ+ counterparts, driven by
existing economic inequities and multi-level anti-LGBTQ+ stigma. However, inequity in financial burden has not
been estimated using national datasets, nor, has an intersectional lens been taken to dig into the diversity of
the LGBTQ+ population. Innovation: Employing multiple national datasets with sexual orientation and gender
identity data (SOGI) data (Aims 1 and 2) as well as an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design with in-
depth qualitative interviews (Aim 3) provides a novel opportunity to provide national findings among LGBTQ+
cancer survivors paired with in-depth experiences of LGBTQ+ cancer caregivers. Integration of cancer-related
financial hardship frameworks and the theory of intersectionality is not only responsive to national calls to
center health equity (NOT-HS-21-014) it allows, for the first time, comprehensive and robust estimates to be
generated for LGBTQ+ cancer survivors of diverse identities. Aims: Aim 1 will use multivariable logit
regression to estimate inequities in material, behavioral, and psychological financial hardship between LGB
(e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual) and non-LGB cancer survivors in the National Health Interview Survey. Aim 2 will
employ intersectional analyses to estimate inequity in behavioral financial hardship across identities and ages
between LGBTQ+ and non-LGBTQ+ cancer survivors in the All of Us Research Program dataset. Aim 3 will
use an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design including in-depth qualitative interview building on an
existing federally funded parent grant study. Aim 3 analyses will describe the lived experience of financial
burden among LGBTQ+ cancer caregivers as well as provide multi-level LGBTQ+ specific recommendations.
Study Impact: This study employs multiple data sources that each provide unique and important context to
LGBTQ+ inequities in financial hardship. Affordability is crucial to access to care, thus understanding the
between and within LGBTQ+ community variation in financial hardship promotes equity in health services
delivery. Overall, the purpose of this study is to estimate inequity, identify modifiable factors, and elicit
LGBTQ+ recommendations to improve the provision of cancer health services to LGBTQ+ populations."

Multidrug efflux pumps actively expel a wide range of toxic substrates across the cell envelope and play a
significant role in both intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance. Additionally, overproduction of efflux pumps
is associated with virulence in many pathogenic bacteria. The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is broadly conserved in
gram-negative bacteria and transports many critical antibiotics used worldwide. We will investigate the assembly
process in situ to understand multidrug efflux across two membranes in the context of the cell wall and cellular
membrane environment. In the proposed approach, genetic, biochemical, and structural experiments will be
used synergistically with new computational methods to characterize how efflux pump inhibitors and antibiotics
impact efflux pumps in multidrug-resistant E. coli clinical isolates that overproduce AcrAB. These studies will
generate a comprehensive picture of the tripartite pump assembly sequence, and the role of the cellular
environment in the transport status of active drug efflux. We anticipate the resulting data will help elucidate the
basis for drug resistance in bacterial pathogens and be an important step toward developing new strategies to
block efflux."

Jeffrey Elmendorf, David Guertin and Kathryn Wellen are pleased to co-chair the next Federation of American
Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) conference on “Molecular Metabolism: From Cell Biology to
Systems Physiology.” The event will be held at Southbridge Hotel & Conference Center Southbridge, MA,
during the week of July 14-18, 2024. This marks a new venue and an expanded theme for one of the longest-
running and best-regarded meetings in the FASEB SRC series, historically focused on glucose transporters,
insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. The conference was originally launched in 1993 in recognition of
the cloning and characterization of a subset of the major glucose transporter isoforms. Over the ensuing years,
the meeting has continued to feature important advances in glucose regulation, evolving in recent meetings to
embrace new topics in glucose homeostasis, metabolite signaling, and systems physiology as they relate to
chronic diseases and conditions including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Our 2024
conference will highlight newly discovered mechanisms of metabolic regulation and dysregulation at both the
cell and organ level. The themes of the meeting were also chosen to align with challenges faced by the
pharmaceutical and biotech industries in identifying new therapeutic targets that combat tractable disease
mechanisms. For example, the conference will shine a spotlight on basic, clinical, and pharmaceutical science
behind bench-to-beside aspects of drug development, as well as on breakthrough advances in the metabolic
relationships between various diseases. A particular example will be a session centered around GLP1-based
therapies to inspire both young and established, investigators to forge ahead with studies aimed at disease
prevention and treatment avenues. Importantly, this and other sessions have been designed with the goals of
attracting young investigators and in maintaining an inclusive conference environment by which trainees and
established investigators of all cultural backgrounds and personal characteristics can benefit. We have invited
32 scientists from institutions and companies worldwide to speak at the meeting, as well as an additional
dozen prominent scientists to serve as session chairs and discussion leaders. In addition to these speakers we
will be selecting approximately 16 short talks from abstracts to be presented by junior investigators,
postdoctoral fellows, and students. We will also run several poster sessions, and continue two very well-
received events launched at previous meetings; a ""speed-dating"" session to facilitate networking and
encourage student participation from the very beginning of the meeting; and an “open mike” session of
approximately 2 hours to allow volunteers to present particularly exciting data for discussion, with about 10
minutes per speaker. We will also hold a career development workshop focusing on the use of social media
platforms in science."

 Protein-Energy Wasting (PEW) is a prevalent complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD),
leading to muscle wasting and significantly contributing to morbidity and mortality. Maintaining
skeletal muscle homeostasis and function is essential for CKD patient care. However, the precise
mechanisms causing muscle wasting and the development of effective therapeutic strategies
remain under investigation.
 We aim to pinpoint the CRL4ACRBN ubiquitin E3 ligase as a novel catabolic mediator
responsible for muscle protein loss in CKD. Our initial findings indicate that the CRL4ACRBN E3
ligase is activated in CKD mouse muscles. Targeted disruption of this ligase in muscles
effectively counters CKD-induced muscle wasting. Using tandem-affinity purification of
ubiquitinated proteins combined with quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified two potential
CRL4ACRBN E3 ligase targets: ovarian tumor deubiquitinase 7B (OTUD7B) and peroxiredoxin-5
(PRDX5). OTUD7B is an enzyme that inhibits TRAF7-induced NF-kB signaling, while PRDX5 is
recognized for its protective role against mitochondrial-associated oxidative stress. In human
skeletal muscle cell cultures, we noted that pomalidomide, a CRL4ACRBN E3 ligase inhibitor,
counters cytokine-induced reductions in OTUD7B and PRDX5. This intervention results in the
suppression of atrogene expression, proteolysis, and oxidative stress.
 From these observations, we hypothesize that activating CRL4ACRBN E3 ligase hastens the
degradation of OTUD7B and PRDX5, amplifying atrogene expression and oxidative stress.
Conversely, inhibiting this E3 ligase should deter catabolic signaling and combat oxidative stress,
thereby curbing the onset of muscle wasting in CKD. In this proposal, we plan to employ multi-
omics methods, transgenic models, and a humanized mouse model to address three pivotal
questions: How does CKD activate the CRL4ACRBN E3 ligase in muscles? Through what
mechanisms does it exacerbate muscle wasting? Can the FDA-approved drug, pomalidomide,
reverse CKD-induced muscle wasting? Our research could unveil novel pathways implicated in
muscle wasting and showcase the promise of drug repurposing as a cost-effective and efficient
means for devising viable therapeutic strategies."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong, common neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) with high heritability
and complex genetic architecture. Known genetic risk factors, including large effect, de novo mutations that
cause approximately 10% of ASD cases, have their maximal expression and converge during early brain
development to impact neurogenesis and neuronal development. Yet, multiple analyses of post-mortem brain
from individuals with ASD have consistently identified pervasive microglial activation. Study of cortical
development in ASD has centered around neurons. So, there is a dearth of knowledge surrounding microglia
function in the developing brain in ASD, which is especially important because microglia colonize the developing
fetal cortex during the epoch during in which ASD risk genes converge. Here, I propose to leverage advances in
human stem cell (SC) culture, including the development and validation of 3D human cortical spheroid (hCS)
models of human brain development, to assess the impact of ASD genetic risk and neuronal-microglial
interactions on microglial function. Cell lines derived from control, non-ASD, SC lines and two SC lines with a
haploinsufficiency of high-risk ASD-associated genes (CHD8 and SCN2A) will be utilized to derive microglia and
hCS. Bulk transcriptomics, morphological analysis, and phagocytosis assays of microglia from SC lines
harboring high risk ASD-associated mutations will reveal how ASD genetic risk impacts microglia physiology,
independent of interactions with neuronal cell types (Aim 1). Transcriptomes will be mapped to the in vivo
developmental trajectory of microglia, and differential gene expression analysis will be performed on the ASD
microglia relative to controls. Perturbations to cortical neurogenesis in ASD will be assessed through single cell
RNA sequencing and immunohistochemical analysis of cell type and morphology in a 3D co-culture system of
human cortical spheroids (hCS) integrated with microglia to model fetal microglial colonization of the cortex (Aim
2). Cell type distribution, differential gene expression, and gene network analysis of ASD mutant hCS compared
to controls at early and late neurogenesis will be performed; immunohistochemistry of cell populations, synapses,
and microglial morphology will validate and extend transcriptomic findings. These experiments will help inform
ASD pathophysiology by elucidating how ASD genetic risk contributes to microglial activation and neuronal-
microglial signaling and provide a framework for testing other ASD risk mutations. This training plan will prepare
this applicant for a successful career as a physician-scientist studying neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs),
via the following major goals: training in stem cell culture and functional genomics, rigor and ethics in scientific
thinking, professional development, and translation of research into the clinical setting. Working in a
collaborative, multidisciplinary laboratory specializing in functional genomic analysis alongside clinical training
and mentorship from physicians practicing in NDD clinics, this applicant is well-positioned to gain the skills
necessary for a productive scientific and clinical career in pediatric neurology and developmental neurobiology."
10997473,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Multicellular nervous systems allow animals to sense and respond to their specific environments. Yet animals
evolved from unicellular eukaryotes, in which a single cell must carry out signal transduction from sensation to
behavior. Therefore, understanding how unicellular eukaryotes sense and transduce important environmental
cues into specific behaviors can reveal foundational principles of cellular signaling upon which animal
multicellular sensory systems are built. Choanoflagellates (choanos) are a diverse group of micro-eukaryotes
that are the closest living relatives of animals. Choanos are bacterivorous, requiring them to sense and navigate
changes in pH, oxygen, and metabolites within their environment to find bacterial prey. Choanos have diversified
to occupy a range of aquatic habitats, providing an opportunity to understand how their sensory mechanisms
evolve to meet the demands of diverse ecologies. Furthermore, while typically unicellular, some choanos also
have simple multicellular forms. Here, I propose to investigate how unicellular organisms detect and respond to
a range of environmental cues and how these sensory systems evolve in conjunction with diverse ecologies and
the innovation of multicellularity. This project builds on my expertise in bioinformatics, microscopy, and choano
genetics, while learning new skills in electrophysiology and the biochemistry of sensory systems in the lab of Dr.
Nicholas Bellono (Harvard MCB), who has pioneered physiological studies of sensory systems in non-traditional
model organisms such as sharks, octopuses, anemones, and more. I plan to uncover fundamental principles of
sensory biology and signal transduction, as well as to help reconstruct the types of sensory systems found in the
unicellular ancestors of animals. I will be aided by an interdisciplinary advisory team, including my co-sponsor
Dr. Richard Losick (Harvard MCB), a rigorous molecular biologist who will push me towards a mechanistic
understanding of my system. I will also collaborate with Dr. Agnese Seminara (Univeristy of Genoa), a
biophysicist specializing in fluid dynamics and decision-making, as well as Dr. Ryan Nett (Harvard MCB), an
expert on small molecule isolation and characterization. I will characterize choano behavior and physiology in
response to pH, oxygen, and bacterial metabolites, using electrophysiology and genetically encoded Ca2+
indicator strains (Aim 1). I will identify the receptors mediating these sensory systems and use gene family
evolution analyses to explore how these choano receptor families have diversified in response to divergent
aquatic environments (Aim 2). Finally, I will explore how choanos integrate multiple simultaneous sensory cues
(e.g. pH and oxygen) in both their unicellular and multicellular forms to understand how multicellular evolution
drives the innovation and integration of sensory systems, essential for animal origins."

 Millions of middle-aged and seniors in the United States maintain their blood pressure and prevent
cardiovascular emergencies by taking - and -blockers daily. The total global market grew to $20 B for these
drugs in 2017. These two important drug classes commonly target adrenergic receptors (ARs) that execute
critical physiological functions such as respiration, digestion, circulation, emotion, memory, and cognition
mediated by norepinephrine (NE). Many - and -blockers bind nonspecifically to ARs and do not only produce
pharmaceutical effects but also accompany critical side effects. Therefore, subtype-selective AR agonists and
antagonists can achieve the desired goals without inducing the side effects. Such a request for the two drug
classes has been largely ignored. Among the nine subtypes of ARs, the biologic properties of 2C-ARs drew
interest in the pharmaceutical industry. The presynaptic 2C-ARs regulate the release of NE, dopamine, and
serotonin to the synapse. The brain 2C-ARs mainly concentrate in the limbic regions, such as the striatum and
hippocampus. Taking these properties together, the 2C-ARs can selectively control the neurotransmitter levels
in the limbic regions without affecting the levels in the prefrontal regions. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) features
neuronal loss in the hippocampus, where 2C-ARs are abundant and might be changed by the noradrenergic
neurons projected from locus coeruleus, the first brain system affected by AD. In substance use disorder (SUD),
activation of the 2C-ARs can reduce the neuronal hyperactivity in the limbic regions without affecting the brain
circuit toward the prefrontal cortex, which inhibits the instinctive behavior toward brain stimulants and facilitates
rational judgment against them. Therefore, 2C-ARs can be a good drug target, and their positron emission
tomography (PET) radiotracer can monitor their biological properties under various disease conditions.
 [11C]ORM13070 is an important milestone because this is the first successful subtype-specific AR
radiotracer among their nine subtypes. However, its pharmacokinetic properties and specificities have to be
improved. The current project will develop the first fluorine-18 (F-18) 2C-AR radiotracers and evaluate them by
comparing their properties with [11C]ORM13070. We designed various 1,4-benzodioxane derivatives based on
ORM13070. The current strategy based on the existing molecular frame reduces the risk of failure and increases
the success of the development with short-term funding. The experience will eventually lead to future
development based on a new molecular framework. The current project selected seven candidate compounds
using a computer-aided docking model study. These compounds will be synthesized, and receptor-binding
assays will further select the compounds. After the target radiotracers are prepared, preclinical PET imaging
studies will evaluate them. The PET imaging data will also be validated by autoradiography and immunohistology.
The successful radiotracer can be patented for the application of diagnosis because Orion Pharma claimed them
only as drugs, and will be applied to SUD and AD preclinical imaging research."
10998444,"Pollution levels in the USA are rising due to climate change, wildfires and increased vehicle traffic.
Recent epidemiological studies indicate that air pollution is a contributing factor to AMD, glaucoma and
other ocular diseases. Health risks from air pollution are mostly attributed to fine particulate matter
smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) that can induce oxidative stress, DNA damage and activate
inflammatory pathways throughout the body. Indeed, PM2.5 levels are correlated with increased
incidence of AMD, glaucoma, elevated IOP and changes to the RPE, outer segment layer, and retinal
arterioles. However, the molecular changes induced by acute and chronic outdoor air pollution in the
retina and the role of intrinsic protective tissue responses in reducing damaging effects of pollution are
not understood. Furthermore, the molecular and cellular effects of air pollution in association with age
or AMD-like risk factors has not been examined. Therefore, much remains to be defined about the
underlying mechanisms of pollution-induced retinal damage and there is a clear need to generate and
characterize reproducible animal models of PM2.5-induced retinal disease. This proposal addresses an
understudied yet highly significant area of environmental health and ophthalmic research. A newly
designed animal housing unit overcomes prior technical barriers by allowing whole-body exposure of
defined PM2.5 pollutants at specific concentrations. Our overarching hypothesis is that aerosolized
PM2.5 induces specific oxidative stress and inflammation pathways and alters intrinsic tissue protective
responses, leading to retinal pathology in wildtype mice, and that damage is exacerbated in retinas
susceptible to pollution from aging and underlying AMD-like pathology. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that PM2.5 pollution exposure causes sustained inflammatory changes in the retina and alters intrinsic
cell stress responses. We will measure aerosolized PM2.5-induced molecular and cellular changes in
normal, aged and AMD-like mouse retinas over time, using flow cytometry, cytokine assays and
scRNAseq. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that PM2.5 exposure accelerates the rate and extent of retinal
pathology in aged and AMD-susceptible mice. Therefore, this study will have an important impact on
the field by developing new mouse models used to characterize pollution effects, define the natural
history of pollution-induced retinal pathology, characterize underlying mechanisms of pollution-induced
retinal damage and intrinsic tissue responses, and will identify targets for future study and therapeutic
intervention."

This is a resubmission (original December 2022). Work on SA1 and didactic training is underway.
 Demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the United States is high and frequently exceeds supply.
This leads to delays or denials of ICU admission, which are associated with increases in patient morbidity and
mortality. In over 60% of US hospitals, intermediate care (i.e., step-down care, progressive care) is an
alternative to intensive care for some patients. While the organization, provider staffing models, and monitoring
and interventions available in Intermediate Care Units (IMCUs) varies, a consistent feature distinguishing
intensive care, intermediate care, and acute ward care is the nurse-to-patient ratio (NPR). Whereas the
standard NPR in the ICU is 1:1 or 1:2, it is usually 1:3 in IMCUs, and 1:5 or 1:6 on acute care wards. These
different ratios reflect an assumption that intermediate care is associated with less workload per patient than
ICU patients, and more than ward patients. However, there are concerns that nurse workload in some models
of intermediate care exceeds that of ICU nurses. Importantly, excessive workload is tightly linked to increased
patient morbidity and mortality, low nurse job satisfaction and high burnout. It is essential to understand what
features of intermediate care nursing work modify (e.g., amplify or decrease) workload in different models of
intermediate care.
 In this mixed methods proposal, we will conduct in-depth qualitative assessments to identify
performance shaping features (PSFs) of intermediate care nursing work. These qualitative assessments are
guided by the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) conceptual framework, a well-
established human factors engineering approach, to guide ethnographic observations, semi-structured
interviews, and focus groups of intermediate care nurses to identify PSFs that amplify or decrease nursing
work. We will then conduct a quantitative assessment to characterize the strength of association between
these PSFs and perceived nursing workload among intermediate care nurses in the Johns Hopkins Health
System (JHHS). Perceived nursing workload will be measured using the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), a short (< 5 minute) and well validated measure (in many work
systems including nursing) of perceived workload.
 This proposed research and training, including didactic instruction in statistics, epidemiology, human
factors engineering, qualitative methods, and survey design will provide the applicant with the experience and
skill needed to continue his professional goal of becoming an independent investigator studying intermediate
and critical care delivery within health systems. These findings will provide important insight into planning and
supervising this level of care and will provide preliminary data for a planned K23 proposal to be submitted in
his fourth year of fellowship."
10998027,"Abstract
Human eye development is an exquisitely balanced crosstalk of numerous signaling pathways that iteratively
dictate the ebb and flow of this complex and highly physiologically active organ. Amongst the plethora of genetic
mutations that can derail this sensitive programming, larger scale ocular malformations are encapsulated under
a spectrum known as Microphthalmia (small eye globes), Anophthalmia (missing eye globes), and Coloboma
(failed closure of the choroid fissure), collectively referred as MAC syndrome that affects approximately 1:10,000
live births. The following proposal highlights an anomalous index case of human bilateral anophthalmia and XX
sex-reversal (BASR) syndrome. This anatomically male child was born with bilateral anophthalmia, a left cystic
orbital mass, focal brain lesions, and is genetically female (XX). Their disease is the result of a de novo mutation
on the long arm of their paternal X chromosome (Xq27). This region contains an extra copy of a large fragment
(640k base pairs) from the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q21) which translocated during paternal meiosis I. The
translocated fragment contained regulatory elements of an ion channel gene, TRPM3. Most fascinatingly, the
exact point in which the translocation happened was at a 180 base pair palindrome on Xq27 that has been the
causal site of mutation for a staggering number of other congenital disorders that affect, not just the eye, but
numerous other tissue compartments or organ systems. These disorders involve the translocation of different
autosomal fragments that land at this locus. To address BASR etiology, as well as molecularly unify all the
disorders that map back to this translocation hotspot, we hypothesize that SOX3, a neighboring transcription
factor, is ectopically activated within tissue domains that correspond to the translocated fragments. Additionally,
we hypothesize that SOX3 in BASR was activated in the pigmented monolayer of cells in the back of the retina
(retinal pigment epithelium; RPE) that is essential for photoreceptor health and ocular genesis. The following
training plan seeks to test this hypothesized SOX3 etiology through both in vitro and in vivo modalities. By utilizing
immortalized blood cells from the BASR patient, I aim to characterize the misfolded higher-order genetic
landscape that comprises the Xq27 mutation through sequencing of closely associated regions (Hi-C).
Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cells from the BASR patient will be induced to become RPE, during which
I will gather and conduct serial analysis of the genetic expression of this process within a BASR context via
single-cell sequencing. I aim to complement these efforts with characterization of a BASR mouse model, in which
partially formed eye rudiments within these newly generated transgenic mice that ectopically express Sox3 will
be immuno-detected and qualitatively assessed for any potential transdifferentiation."
10979390,"About two million persons are diagnosed with cancer every year in the US. The Effective clinical management
of cancer patients including the use of oral therapies can improve outcomes and reduce costs. However,
adherence rates to oral therapies in cancer treatment have been reported to be 20%, depending on the drug.2
Poor Patient-provider communication (PCC) is one of the barriers to adherence to oral chemotherapies in
addition to adverse drug events and lack of knowledge about adherence. Timely and effective PPC with high
levels of empathy shown by providers to address patients’ emotional concerns, wants, and needs can enhance
patients’ trust in healthcare providers, and their clinical outcomes such as adherence and emergency services
utilization. New digital health platforms such as secure messaging (SM) through patient portals can provide an
effective and timely channel of Electronic Patient-Provider Communication (EPPC). Patients with and without
cancer are increasingly using secure messaging to communicate their needs. As of May 2019, out of 1M patients
that visited Yale New-Haven Health System (YNHHS), about 436,000 patients used the patient portal resulting
in more than 2.7M messages. With the identification and quantification of EPPC in SM contents, we can measure
associations and impact on patient-centered outcomes. However, existing studies to identify EPPC patterns in
large scale SM data are limited as they focused only on patients’ messages and minimally included providers’
messages. Some studies are not scalable as they manually coded EPPC patterns for a small set of SM. We will
fill this gap using natural language processing and machine learning approaches that will utilize big SM data.
In our previous work we mapped expressions in SM into EPPC codes of communication using the Roter
Interaction Analysis System (RIAS); a method to code medical interactions and developed the Electronic Patient-
Provider Communication miner (EPPCminer) tool. It can detect three EPPC codes: information seeking and
giving, socio-emotional behavior. In this study, we will (1) refine EPPCminer to more effectively extract more
granular EPPC codes of information seeking (e.g., medication-, lab-, imaging-related), information giving of
social determinants of health (e.g., transportation, economic concerns, food), socio-emotional behavior,
partnership building, and shared decision-making. We will refine EPPCminer using SM from YNHHS and
Cleveland Clinic and evaluate generalizability using Veterans Administration (VA) data. partnership building, and
shared decision-making. We will also assess and score quality of bi-directional communication by examining
providers’ responses to patients’ requests in SM. (2) We will apply EPPCminer to SM of a cohort of patients with
different types of metastatic. We will then extract and characterize EPPC codes from 1 year worth of prospective
patients’ and providers’ SM and examine their associations with scores of patient-reported communication
assessments. (3) We will assess the impact of EPPC codes on patients’ outcomes: adherence using pharmacy
data and patient-reported adherence data, emergency room (ER) visits, and hospitalizations."

Over 3.4 million patients in the U.S. have epilepsy, with no preventative treatments and approximately one-
third of patients being refractory to drug treatment. This makes elucidating the basic mechanisms of epilepsy
development a pressing priority so that more effective therapeutics can be developed.
Abnormal excitatory neurons are a common pathological feature of childhood epilepsies, including tuberous
sclerosis complex and focal cortical dysplasia, but it is unclear whether, and which, other cells are responsible
for regulating these neurons. This proposal will address this deficit by evaluating the role of a potentially critical
subpopulation of interneurons. The Danzer lab has developed a mouse model of epilepsy in which Pten, an
mTOR pathway inhibitor, is deleted from a subset of hippocampal granule cells (DGCs) to introduce abnormal
(DGC Pten knockout (KO)) DGCs into an otherwise normal brain. Epilepsy development in these mice
provides evidence of granule cell involvement in epileptogenesis. Although not directly targeted in this model,
animals develop impaired inhibition and interneuron loss. Findings suggest that epilepsy may develop via
accumulation of aberrant DGCs followed by disruption of inhibitory restraint of those abnormal cells.
This proposal will test the hypothesis that somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons provide critical inhibitory
control over Pten KO DGCs. A key prediction of this hypothesis is that SST interneuron disruption will
dramatically exacerbate epilepsy severity in these animals. The objective of this research is to evaluate the
significance of hippocampal SST interneurons in the Pten KO model and determine whether ablation of these
sprouted SST neurons induces an increase in disease severity. The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that
SST interneurons restrain hyperexcitable granule cells in the Pten KO model and that loss of these sprouted
SST interneurons will amplify epilepsy severity. To reveal SST interneurons, DGC Pten KO mice that express
a fluorescent reporter in those interneurons have been generated. A viral strategy will be used to induce
expression of a silencing archaerhodopsin in hippocampal SST neurons. Aim 1 will establish whether SST
input to Pten KO cells is enhanced using morphological and patch clamp electrophysiology approaches. Aim 2
will functionally assess the importance of SST neuron-mediated inhibition by determining whether SST
interneuron ablation in Pten KO mice exacerbates their epilepsy phenotype. To evaluate the impact of the loss
of SST interneurons, SST interneurons will be removed either alone or in combination with Pten KO in DGCs
to determine whether interneuron ablation and Pten KO in DGCs will result in more severe epilepsy than either
insult alone. Virally-induced expression of diphtheria toxin receptor in SST interneurons will enable their
ablation after treatment with diphtheria toxin. These studies will reveal how somatostatin interneurons are
altered in the setting of epilepsy and the role they play in restraining mTOR hyperexcitable granule cells."

 Meniscus tears are one of the most common knee injuries and often fail to heal in adults. Current surgical
treatments increase osteoarthritis (OA) risk, especially in patients with metabolic syndrome (including obesity,
hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia). While this is often attributed to mechanical overloading, metabolic syndrome
is also associated with OA in non-weightbearing joints. Preclinical studies suggest elevated inflammatory signals
from adipose tissue (e.g., adipokine dysregulation) mediate articular cartilage degeneration following meniscal
injury. Obesity and OA are associated with aberrant microstructural remodeling and strain attenuation in the outer
meniscus. Despite these findings, the mechano-metabolic mechanisms controlling meniscus cell function remain
unresolved. To address these gaps in knowledge, this proposal will investigate the impact of metabolic syndrome
on meniscus cell mechanoactivation. Our central hypothesis is that persistent adipokine dysregulation
exacerbates degeneration by altering meniscus cell setpoints for mechano-responsivity and perturbing their
response to homeostatic signals. To test this hypothesis, this proposal uses novel, multiscale experimental
techniques to determine if metabolic syndrome impairs transmission of tensional cues in the meniscus.
Specifically, Aim 1 will test if mechano-metabolic interactions alter meniscus cell contractile force generation and
response to static and dynamic microenvironmental cues. Aim 2 will determine how metabolic memory arising
from transient and sustained adipokine dysregulation influences meniscus cell mechanoactivation, phenotype,
and multiscale tissue mechanical properties in response to homeostatic and pathological tensional cues. I
hypothesize that adipokine dysregulation will impair meniscus cell contractile force generation and
mechanoactivation, leading to loss of fibrous phenotype and aberrant matrix remodeling. This work will generate
novel insight into how mechanotransductive and metabolic crosstalk regulates fibrous tissue homeostasis and
direct regenerative strategies for meniscus repair in high-risk patients."

The achievements obtained with different types of cancer immunotherapy are clear, with durable long-term
survival in some cases. The most frequently used immunotherapeutic approach is the treatment with
immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, the major limitation of these immunotherapies is the relative high
frequency of long-lasting immuno-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with the treatments. irAEs triggered
by ICI can affect most any tissue. Thus, given the increasing burden of irAEs, determining a) the mechanisms
that drive the irAEs, b) those patients who are at a higher risk to develop irAEs, and c) novel strategies to
minimize irAEs while sustaining the ICI anti-tumor efficacy are unmet needs. The irAEs caused with ICI
treatments are mainly due to an overresponse of CD4 and CD8 cells, and T cell-produced cytokines are a major
mediator of irAEs. Until recently, minimal attention was given to IL-6 as a mediator of the irAEs from ICI therapy,
despite the well-established role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory diseases. This is in part
due to the fact that IL-6 is considered a cytokine produced by the innate immune system. We have recently
shown that human CD4 cells (but not mouse CD4 cells) from healthy volunteers produce high levels of IL-6
quickly after activation. The levels of IL-6 produced by human CD4 cells after activation are heterogenous among
healthy volunteers, suggesting a potential genetic influence. Although IL-6R expression is restricted to
leukocytes and hepatocytes, IL-6 can also trigger signals in cells that do not express IL-6R (e.g. endothelial cells,
neurons, cardiomyocytes) and cause pathology when soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) is present, binds to IL-6 and
associates with ubiquitously expressed gp130. We have shown that human CD4 cells produce high levels of sIL-
6R upon activation.
 There is a high-frequency polymorphism in the promoter of human IL-6 gene (-174G/C, rs1800795) that
can affect the production of IL-6. Similarly, a polymorphism (rs2228145) in the coding region of the IL-6R gene
can lead to enhanced levels of sIL-6R. We propose that the IL-6 and/or sIL-6R produced by activated CD4 cells
after treatment of cancer patients with ICI are major mediators of the irAE caused by this therapy, and that the
genetic polymorphisms in IL-6 and/or IL-6R genes could determine the risk of patients to develop irAE. We will
investigate: 1) the effect of genetic polymorphisms on the production of IL-6 and sIL-6R by human CD4 cells
from healthy volunteers; 2) whether polymorphisms in IL-6 and/or IL-6R genes are associated with the
development of irAE in ICI-treated cancer patients."

Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can lead to a wide range of physical, behavioral, and cognitive impairments
referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The estimated prevalence of FASD is 2-5% of children
in the United States, making PAE one of the leading preventable causes of neurodevelopmental disorders.
Despite the known damaging effects of PAE, 10% of women in the United States report consuming alcohol
during pregnancy; thus, PAE is a major public health concern. Additionally, caregivers of children with PAE
often report their child has sleep problems; yet, relatively little is known of sleep quality in this population,
whether alterations in circadian rhythmicity contribute to sleep problems, and how sleep quality changes as
individuals with PAE enter adolescence. We recently found that children with FASD display greater night-to-
night variability in sleep duration, and this night-to-night variability is more pronounced in older children.
Further, we found that PAE disturbs expression levels of core clock genes that may be associated with altered
sleep cycles and behavioral problems observed in children with PAE. Thus, PAE may greatly impact an
individual’s circadian rhythmicity, which plays a role in an individual’s physiological, health, and behavioral
functioning. Yet, no studies to date have examined circadian rhythmicity in this population and its relationship
to sleep quality and behavior. This study will explore whether altered circadian rhythmicity is a biological
mechanism that explains sleep disturbances in children and adolescents with PAE. Additionally, limited studies
have explored age-related differences in sleep in individuals with FASD. Particularly, there is a dearth in
research investigating whether sleep disturbances persist into adolescence, a critical developmental period
marked by important psychophysiological changes in sleep behavior and architecture. This proposal will also
examine sleep quality and circadian rhythmicity during adolescence. Moreover, we will investigate whether
these behaviors affect cognitive and behavioral functioning in adolescents with PAE, as we have seen that
sleep quality mediates aspects of neurobehavioral functioning in children with PAE, including cognitive,
emotional, and behavioral functioning. If sleep problems contribute to difficulties in domains outside of sleep,
interventions that target sleep could also improve cognitive and emotional functioning as well. Elucidation of
the mechanisms by which PAE alters sleep and understanding how sleep and circadian rhythmicity change
across development in individuals with PAE will allow us to develop effective interventions to improve quality of
life of individuals with FASD."

Asthma is a heterogenous disease that impacts ~10% of the US population. It presents as a syndrome of non-
specific airway hyperresponsiveness, inflammation and intermittent respiratory symptoms. Even though more
than half of patients receiving standard asthma medication remain uncontrolled, mainstay treatments have been
largely unchanged for several decades. While the introduction of the asthma-specific biologics in the last several
years has improved asthma for some, those treatments are extremely costly and are typically reserved for the
most severe of patients. For most asthma patients, responses are mediated by environmental allergens which
frequently possess potent protease activity. These allergen proteases provoke an increased allergen response,
in part by the direct activation of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2). PAR2 is a newly established target for
development of novel analgesics and therapeutics for inflammatory diseases, including asthma. We have
developed novel antagonists to PAR2 that in preliminary experiments using pre-clinical models have proven to
be effective in inhibiting or reducing the detrimental physiological changes associated with allergen-induce
asthma. Our central hypothesis for this application is: Small molecule pharmacological control of airway
epithelial and/or nociceptor PAR2 signaling provides a novel strategy for asthma protection that can be
demonstrated in vivo. We propose 3 specific aims, in which we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo
approaches to uncover a mechanistic understanding for the roles for epithelial- and neuronal-expressed PAR2
in allergic asthma. These studies will specify pharmacological impact of PAR2 modulation on airway epithelial
cells and sensory neurons in vitro and in pre-clinical asthma models with human validation and will provide
mechanistic understanding and cellular targeting for development of novel asthma drugs for clinical trials."

Opioid agonist therapies (i.e. buprenorphine and methadone) are first-line treatments for opioid use disorder
(OUD) and overdose prevention. Sequalae of alcohol use disorder (AUD) can interfere with opioid agonist
therapy retention, worsen OUD symptoms, and increase risk of overdose. Contingency management (CM) is
an evidence-based approach for promoting opioid agonist retention and alcohol abstinence that could address
both behaviors simultaneously to improve outcomes for co-occurring opioid and alcohol use disorder (OUD-
AUD). This study will pilot an innovative and highly scalable digital CM treatment, delivered via mobile device,
among Medicaid beneficiaries with OUD-AUD and conduct implementation strategy development for a future
effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial. The study includes three aims. Aim 1 will identify optimal settings and
approaches to engage Medicaid beneficiaries with OUD-AUD in digital CM through analysis of Medicaid claims
data. Aim 2 will convene an Advisory Board to develop a roadmap for implementation, sustainability, and health
equity for digital CM in real-world care, and Aim 3 will include a mixed methods randomized pilot trial to test
feasibility and acceptability of digital CM for OUD-AUD. We will compare opioid agonist retention and alcohol
abstinence during the intervention period and follow-ups among those randomized to digital CM vs. an
attention- and incentive-matched comparison condition. Exit interviews with participants and index sites will
elucidate patient and provider perceptions of factors influencing digital CM adoption to inform the future
effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial. Together, these aims will ensure inclusion of a diverse,
representative sample from appropriate clinical locations guided by Medicaid claims data, perspectives from
Medicaid beneficiaries with lived experience of OUD-AUD, and our Advisory Board—hastening research-to-
practice translation. Digital CM optimized for use with Medicaid beneficiaries with OUD-AUD could address a
major public health problem among a diverse and underserved population. This study’s emphasis on
implementation, sustainability, and health equity aligns with national priorities to address real-world
complexities of addressing co-occurring OUD-AUD, with high likelihood of real-world impact."

Down syndrome (DS) is the most common form of autosomal aneuploidy in humans, with an incidence of ~1 in
700 live births, and is characterized by physical growth delays, skeletal abnormalities, neurological deficits and
cognitive impairments. Although the genetic cause of DS is full or partial triplication of chromosome 21 (HSA21),
triplicated genes on HSA21 do not fully account for the widespread transcriptional dysregulation observed in DS.
Given the tremendous amount of variability in the severity and clinical presentation of DS, it has long been
believed that epigenetic processes may also contribute importantly to global patterns of transcriptional
dysregulation, both during neurodevelopment and in adulthood. However, until recently, our understanding of
how chromatin-based mechanisms may contribute to DS-related phenotypes remained limited. During the
previous funding periods of this R01, we found that the HSA21-encoded chromatin effector protein, BRWD1, is
upregulated in neurons from individuals with DS and in brain of both male and female trisomic mice. We
demonstrated that selective copy number restoration of Brwd1 in trisomic animals robustly rescues deficits in
hippocampal LTP, gene expression and cognition. We observed that Brwd1 binds tightly to the mammalian BAF
chromatin remodeling complex – both neural progenitor (np) BAF during development and neuronal (n) BAF in
adulthood – and that increased Brwd1 expression promotes BAF genomic mistargeting. Importantly, Brwd1
renormalization rescues aberrant BAF localization, along with associated changes in chromatin accessibility and
gene expression. These findings established BRWD1 as a key epigenomic mediator of normal
neurodevelopment and an important contributor to DS-related phenotypes. Although Brwd1 is clearly important
for BAF genomic targeting and neural gene expression, the molecular mechanisms through which this targeting
is achieved remains unclear, and the primary neural cell-types affected by Brwd1 triplication in DS-like brain
have yet to be explored. Also, while DS has largely been assumed to be untreatable due to disrupted in utero
development, our recent data suggest that restoring Brwd1 gene activity in early postnatal brain may be sufficient
to ameliorate cognitive deficits in adult trisomic mice, yet the molecular underpinnings and/or importance of
neurodevelopmental timing of this rescue have yet to be explored. Using a unique combination of biochemical,
single-cell omics, genetic and behavioral analyses, we will comprehensively explore: (Aim 1) the biochemical
basis through which Brwd1 recruits the BAF complex to neural chromatin via its histone ‘reader’ functions and
protein-protein interactions; (Aim 2) the longitudinal and cell-type specific contributions of Brwd1 triplication to
BAF genomic targeting, chromatin accessibility and gene expression across multiple brain regions known to be
affected in DS; and (Aim 3) the molecular, physiological and behavioral impact of Brwd1 copy number restoration
during postnatal periods. These studies will provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of Brwd1
dysregulation in DS-like brain and inform on the possibility of postnatal treatments for this disorder."

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are genetically engineered T lymphocytes designed to sense
antigens and mount an immune response. Though CAR T cells have received FDA approval for the treatment
of several hematologic malignancies, success in solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment, and treatment-limiting adverse effects such as on-target, off-tumor toxicity and cytokine
release syndrome. Though investigators report strategies for mitigating these limitations such as biomaterials for
reshaping the tumor microenvironment, and logic-gated CAR T cells to prevent non-specific toxicity, no proposed
strategy has overcome each of these barriers. To surmount these limitations, I propose the use of a novel self-
assembled hydrogel for implantation into tumor. This hydrogel will be used in conjunction with a split CAR T cell
called a zipCAR, which uses a split adaptor protein (zipFv) to sense antigens. The hydrogel is composed of a 4
arm PEG linker decorated with leucine zippers that can be loaded with zipCargo proteins (payload proteins that
are modified with a leucine zipper, including zipFv). The hydrogel supplies the zipFv adaptor protein, cytokines
(IL-7), and chemokines (CXCL9). I hypothesize that the use of this in situ hydrogel will overcome the
barriers to CAR T cell therapy in solid tumors by: 1) opposing T cell anergy and promoting proliferation
in the resection cavity; 2) preventing antigen escape via encapsulation of zipFvs targeting multiple
antigens; and, 3) imparting spatiotemporal control over CAR T cell activity. Aim 1 will demonstrate the
advantage of the hydrogel by monitoring CAR T cell migration and proliferation in a murine model of ROR1+
lung cancer. Aim 2 will document the efficacy and safety advantages of the hydrogels in a toxicity model of lung
cancer. To demonstrate prevention of antigen escape, ROR1- and MSLN-deficient lung cancer cell lines will be
created using CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts. In a murine model of antigen escape, these cells will be used to
demonstrate superior efficacy in mice treated with zipCAR T cells and hydrogels loaded with zipFvs against both
antigens.
 This proposal builds around five key components of critical research and clinical skills to support my
development into an independent engineer/scientist: (1) an interdisciplinary research project focusing on
novel surgical biomaterials for enhancement of CAR T cell activity; (2) multi-disciplinary mentoring from Drs.
Grinstaff (biomaterials), Wong (immunotherapy); and, Colson (clinical medicine, animal models, and
immunology), (3) academic engineer-scientist in research conduct and communication skills, (4) clinical
awareness program, overseen by Dr. Yolonda Colson a nationally recognized surgeon, and (5) professional
development activities to guide my training goals."

 My overarching goal is to become a biomedical engineer capable of advancing minimally invasive
procedures through medical imaging and machine learning. To achieve this, I aim to develop a broad
understanding of diagnostic and interventional radiology and robust technical skills in acquiring, reconstructing,
and applying machine learning techniques to biomedical imaging data. This research focuses on addressing
unsolved engineering problems in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based evaluation of focused ultrasound
for breast cancer treatment, providing a strong foundation for a successful career in interventional imaging.
 Traditionally, MRI has provided qualitative insights into biological tissues. Recent advances in image
acquisition, reconstruction, and deep learning have created new opportunities for making quantitative
measurements of physical and chemical properties using MRI. Deep learning techniques face technical
challenges in quantitative MRI, such as the absence of large training datasets and their current inability to cope
with variations across scanners and protocols, especially in the interventional context. This work investigates
integrating physics knowledge into the architecture and training of deep learning models to mitigate these
problems and enable reliable and clinically deployable quantitative MRI techniques for evaluating MR-guided
focused ultrasound breast cancer treatments. Aim 1 uses physics-informed machine learning to develop an
efficient technique for measuring MR relaxation times in the breast using configuration state imaging. A
physics-informed neural network architecture and training paradigm will be methodically investigated using
simulated data. The developed model will then be trained on sparse real data acquired using a multi-echo
configuration state imaging sequence and rigorously evaluated on data from phantoms, healthy volunteers,
and breast cancer patients across multiple MR scanners and time points. Aim 2 aims to develop a time-efficient
technique for obtaining diffusion measurements in breast imaging with full 3D coverage, evaluating the relative
performance of conventional model-based techniques and physics-informed neural networks in estimating
diffusion parameters from the collected data. After developing the sequence and technique, diffusion
parameter maps will be compared with gold-standard measurements in standardized diffusion phantoms,
healthy volunteers, and breast cancer patients on multiple scanners. This research will advance the current
understanding of how to create generalizable machine learning models for MRI and to design them for usability
in a clinical context. Additionally, the developed MRI techniques will enable clinical and interventional use of
quantitative MRI, supporting the development of biomarkers that provide real-time evaluation of MR-guided
focused ultrasound breast cancer treatments."
10999248,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an incurable autoimmune disease that results in the destruction of insulin
producing β cells and affects nearly 10% of the global population. T1D most commonly affects young children
and adolescents and can lead to irreparable and deadly complications if not properly treated. Current treatments
and management strategies require time-intensive exogenous insulin administration, with incredible onus on
patients and their caregivers. Islet transplantation to replace β cells is an attractive and FDA-approved alternative
to insulin therapy in T1D. However, the widespread acceptance of this approach faces formidable challenges,
including the absence of safe, non-toxic methods to shield transplanted allogeneic donor islets from immune
rejection and a scarcity of donor material. To surmount these hurdles, the field must accomplish two critical
objectives: 1) establish an effective, non-toxic strategy to induce tolerance toward donor tissues and 2) identify
a readily obtainable source of donor material for transplantation.
 An emerging field for transplant tolerance is mixed chimerism achieved by hematopoietic cell transplant
(HCT), establishing tolerance toward donor-matched tissues and correction of defects that cause autoimmunity.
Unfortunately, this requires high doses of radiation and/or chemotherapy to prepare and condition the host prior
to HCT, resulting in undesirable toxicities. The development of low intensity conditioning protocols with reduced
toxicity, adverse effects, and risk for graft vs. host disease (GVHD) is necessary to increase access to HCT for
patients without imminent fatal illness or malignancy. Additionally, pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived β-like cells
offer an attractive and unlimited source of material for islet cell replacement therapy. However, the
immunogenicity of PSC derivatives and the potential for mixed hematopoietic chimerism to induce tolerance to
these derivatives remains unexplored.
 In recent exciting work, we show that a novel low intensity conditioning protocol using monoclonal antibodies
for T cell and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) depletion combined with a non-myeloablative dose of total body
irradiation allows for stable mixed chimerism and donor-matched allogeneic islet transplant tolerance. Here, we
propose to 1) optimize our conditioning protocol to significantly reduce, or eliminate, the radiation dose required
for conditioning and generation of mixed hematopoietic chimerism across full MHC barriers, and 2) evaluate the
immunogenicity of mouse PSC-derived β-like cells and tolerance induction in mixed hematopoietic chimeras.
 Collectively, this research will develop reduced intensity conditioning regimens to produce sustained mixed
chimerism and islet transplant tolerance. This will allow for use of this technique beyond patients with fatal
malignancy or autoimmunity, including in patients with T1D, as well as provide the necessary training for me to
become an independent diabetes-focused researcher."
10977809,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most fatal of cancers, remains impervious to treatment with the current standard
of care (SOC) therapies. Even immunotherapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have failed for GBM
despite their success with other cancers. One critical reason for this failure is that the GBM tumor
microenvironment (TME) is highly immunosuppressive. To change the GBM microenvironment, we and others
have been utilizing direct intra-tumoral administration of gene therapies that express powerful immune-activators,
both preclinically and clinically. In fact, we have concluded a phase 1 clinical trial of intratumoral administration
of a regulatable interleukin 12 (IL12) immunogene therapy in subjects with recurrent GBM (rGBM)1
(NCT02026271). In this trial, post-injection tumors showed increased inflammatory infiltrates including increased
numbers of CD8+ T cells and elevated levels of tumor IFNγ. However, this also was coupled with increases in
tumor PD-L1 and PD-1 positive cells, characteristic of chronic exhaustion and immune escape. Therefore, the
trial suggested that addition of anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint signaling should be beneficial to IL12 immunogene
therapy efficacy. Based on this, we finished accrual to two multi-institutional clinical trials of intratumoral IL12
immunogene therapy (to increase infiltration of IFNγ producing, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells) coupled with neoadjuvant
immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) (NCT03636477 and NCT04006119). These trials have shown that the
combination of these two immunotherapies is well tolerated in humans, but unexpectedly there was no
improvement in efficacy by adding ICI. Based on this clinical result, we propose to explore two questions using
preclinical models of GBM: 1- Does the timing of ICI administration with respect to IL12 immunostimulation
change the therapeutic response? 2- Does GBM immune-evasion from IL12 depend on more than single PD-1
signaling? To provide answers to these two questions, we plan to pursue the following aims: Aim 1- Compare
efficacy, tolerability, and immune effects of neo-adjuvant vs. adjuvant anti-PD1 therapy in mouse models
of GBM treated with intratumoral IL12 immunogene therapy, and Aim 2- Test the efficacy, tolerability,
and immune effects of silencing the immunoevasive noncoding RNA, INCR1, when combined with
intratumoral IL12 immunogene therapy.
The impact from these studies will be to significantly inform whether IL12 (or other cytokines) immunogene
therapy can be improved by changing the timing of ICI administration or by targeting a different pathway that
regulates multiple immunoevasive signals, leading us to the next design of clinical trials using cytokine
immunogene therapy."
10977814,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) results in 5-year survival rates
around 63%; however, treatment is often associated with significant pain as well as a 50% recurrence rate
within the first 2 years. Opioids are the primary strategy for pain control, and the drug requirement is high, with
dosages increasing as tolerance develops. The majority of HNSCC patients are prescribed opioids with
treatment; persisent opioid use continues during survivorship and in recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC
patients. While providing some pain relief, opioids can be immunosuppressive, which can impede treatment
response. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are the current first-line systemic treatment strategy for R/M
HNSCC patients, but fewer than 20% of patients respond to therapy. The impact of concomitant use of opioids
and ICI is currently unknown. Preliminary data using a study cohort of 66 R/M HNSCC patients who received
anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody therapy found that 63% of patients were actively taking opioids for pain prior to
treatment. In this cohort, high opioid usage was associated with lower intratumoral CD8+ T cell density in the
tumor biopsy tissue prior to treatment and significantly lower overall survival in response to ICI treatment.
Additionally, using a syngeneic orthotopic transplant mouse model, the Oprm1 gene was upregulated in tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and acute morphine administration reduced the CD8+ TIL frequency by 90% in
vivo. Methylnaltrexone (MNTX), a peripheral-acting OPRM1 antagonist, completely blocked the morphine-
induced immunosuppression in our mouse model. The hypothesis of this proposal is that exogenous opioids
given for analgesia suppress anti-tumor immunity via immune-mediated OPRM1 signaling. To test this
hypothesis, we will use preclinical mouse models to investigate the functional impact of OPRM1 signaling in
CD8+ T cells on anti-tumor immunity and tumor growth as well as determine the neoadjuvant potential of
MNTX to block opioid-induced immunosuppression and improve ICI response. Additionally, we will use single
cell RNA sequencing and multispectral imaging on preclinical and human tumor tissue to provide a single-cell
level view of anti-tumor immunity with direct consideration of the immunosuppressive effects of opioid usage.
We believe this proposal will lead to new strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance, a critical need for
improving outcomes in HNSCC disease."

Scientists and laypeople have long been fascinated by the senses. Aristotle distinguished four of them, each
linked with one of the four elements – vision with water, sound with air, smell with fire, and touch with earth.
Since that time, we have become aware of many more, including those involving position or pain. Now,
research across a range of disciplines has revealed that sensory perception can modulate many aspects of
physiology and health. Indeed, this project has funded studies in our laboratory that have illuminated basic
and translational principles of how sensory perception influences energy homeostasis, tissue physiology, and
organism aging. Work from our lab has established that exposure of flies to food-based odorants limits the
beneficial effects of dietary restriction, that loss of sensory neurons affects fly lifespan, and that perceptional
experiences of food, sex, and danger modulate lifespan through neural circuits that utilize evolutionarily
conserved neuropeptides. Ongoing work will continue to define a mechanistic framework for sensory
modulation of aging by revealing neural circuits and signaling pathways that emanate from sensory tissues
and that interface with the deeper regions of the central nervous system to orchestrate biological changes in
peripheral tissues. In this renewal, we will interrogate the roles of the biogenic amines serotonin, dopamine,
and octopamine, which regulate persistent neural activity in many systems, in modulating the long-term
effects of sensory perception on health and aging. We will also employ an array of new technologies and
behavioral assays to develop inference on the relationships among these signaling molecules, the associated
neural circuits that modulate lifespan, and the neural states they induce. Additional work will establish
similarities and differences in the ways that sensory inputs impact the activity of a core group of aging-
regulatory neurons in the central complex of the fly brain and will determine how relevant neuromodulators
influence these relationships. Discoveries from our laboratory and others have resulted in a detailed functional
map of the fly brain, and several of the sensory effects on healthy aging described above, and the mechanisms
that underlie them, have since been shown to be conserved in other organisms, including nematodes and mice,
suggesting that a deeper understanding of the mechanisms through which the brain controls fly aging may
lead to novel targets of intervention in humans."
10978084,"Project Summary
Stressful life events are linked to the etiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of
death in the U.S. The mechanisms by which stress causes pathophysiology contributing to CVD are poorly
understood and effective therapeutics that relieve stress and improve cardiovascular health are lacking. A
premise of this proposal is that exploration of the neural circuits controlling the perception of stress may provide
insight towards mechanisms underlying CVD and interventions aimed at its reversal. Causally-linking patterns
of neural activity to stress and the development of CVD in humans is challenging. However, preclinical studies
using laboratory mice that implement modern neuroscience and genetic technologies to excite or inhibit specific
neural circuits make causally-linking neural activity and indices of stress responsiveness achievable. Using
genetically-modified mice, we revealed that the activity of neurons that express genes encoding particular
angiotensin receptor subtypes is coupled to cardiovascular, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to stress.
Specifically, we discovered that neurons expressing the angiotensin type-2 (AT2R) and Mas receptor (MasR)
densely populate cortical and limbic brain regions controlling the perception of psychological stress and that
excitation of these neurons decreases blood pressure, heart rate, circulating levels of corticosterone and anxiety-
like behavior. In the periphery, we discovered that the nodose ganglion is densely populated by neurons
expressing the angiotensin type 1a receptor (AT1R). These neurons function as primary baroreceptor afferents
and excitation of these neurons lowers blood pressure, heart rate and energy expenditure. Collectively, these
observations have led to the overall hypothesis that excitation of particular neuronal populations that
express the AT1R, AT2R or MasR alters the perception of stress to protect against CVD. Experiments will
use the Cre-LoxP system in mice with a cadre of modern neuroscience techniques and classical systems
physiology to confirm or refute this hypothesis. Initial experiments utilize Cre-diver mice with virally-mediated
gene transfer and in vivo optogenetics to determine whether the excitation or inhibition of neurons that express
AT1R, AT2R, or MasR attenuates or exacerbates stress responding. Subsequent experiments use a model of
stress-induced pathophysiology to evaluate how the structure and function of neurons that express the AT1R,
AT2R or MasR is altered by disease. The final experiments attempt to alleviate stress-induced pathophysiology
with optogenetic, genetic or pharmacological manipulations that alter the excitability of neurons that express the
AT1R, AT2R or MasR. We anticipate that the proposed research will reveal, at a detailed and mechanistic level,
neural circuits that provide stress relief, thereby guiding development of novel therapeutics for CVD."
10978161,"Patient-Specific Factors of Recovery in Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy
PROJECT SUMMARY
Rotator cuff tendinopathy is a frequent cause of shoulder pain. A known effective treatment is resistance
exercise, which is the current standard of care. However, the outcomes of resistance exercise are highly
variable, with 40-50% developing chronic or recurrent pain. Resistance exercise should be designed to
stimulate tendon healing and individually tailored to change the biomarker of tendinopathy – tendon structure.
The lack of knowledge as to how the tendon structure responds to resistance exercise, how this relates to
patient-reported pain and disability, and what other factors impact the tendon response is limiting the delivery
of patient-specific treatment approaches and outcomes of care. We hypothesize the tendon response and
patient outcomes are affected by deficits in muscle function, brain pain processing, and psychological factors
as they influence the ability and willingness to move the shoulder. To stimulate tendon structural remodeling,
resistance exercise imparts load to the tendon via muscle activation. Deficits in shoulder muscle activation can
reduce tendon loading and thus healing. Elevated pain-related psychological distress in the form of
kinesiophobia and pain catastrophizing and deficits in pain and sensorimotor processing are associated with
poorer outcomes and chronicity in individuals with rotator cuff tendinopathy. Our pilot work supports our
hypotheses that higher levels of muscle activation along with lower levels of psychological distress, central
pain and sensorimotor processing deficits are associated with a positive tendon structural response and patient
outcomes. In this study, we will quantify the effects of resistance exercise on the biomarker of tendon structure
and the impact of muscle deficits, psychological factors, and brain dysfunction in pain and sensorimotor
processing on shoulder pain and disability outcomes. Patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy (N=70) will be
observed during standard-of-care 8 weeks of a resistance exercise. At baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks we will use
ultrasound to assess tendon structure, electromyography and a load cell for muscle, psychological factors via
patient report, functional magnetic resonance brain imaging for pain and sensorimotor processing dysfunction,
pain-rating during shoulder functional tasks, and shoulder functional outcomes. We will follow-up at 6-months
on patient-reported shoulder outcomes. These data will deliver evidence to design and evaluate a future novel
stepped and matched care pathway clinical trial; patients whose tendon is responsive to exercise will continue
with resistance exercise, and those with limited response will be `stepped and matched' to alternative care of
psychologically-informed treatment for brain dysfunction and psychological deficits, and/or alternative
resistance approach to target muscle deficits. Resistance exercise is a known effective treatment, but not for
everyone. Using the tendon structure as a marker of treatment response will aid in identifying the dose of
exercise, and if other factors effect tendon effects and outcomes. Long-term, we aim to define patient-specific
care pathways that can improve the delivery of care and optimize outcomes."
10978167,"Project Summary
Engineered T cells are emerging as promising therapeutic agents against a wide variety of cancers. However,
despite remarkable success against blood cancers, these cells remain largely ineffective against solid cancers,
due to their inability to sustain antitumor activity in response to chronic tumor stimulation, a process termed
exhaustion. While antigen stimulation is essential for driving the acquisition of effector functions in T cells,
strong and continued stimulation can cause cells to lose effector capabilities and enter an exhausted,
dysfunctional state. Limiting the intensity or duration of signaling could enable T cells to sustain effector
functions without concomitant exhaustion; indeed recent studies have shown that inhibiting signaling to rest
cells from chronic stimulation can enhance T cell persistence and tumor control. However, as some
stimulation is needed for effector function, it will be critical to have therapeutic strategies that can reduce
signaling activity to appropriate intensities or durations for optimal function. In this proposal, we seek to
design, build and test a synthetic feedback controller of T cell signaling, to maintain optimal signaling
for prolonging anti-tumor effector functions and mitigating exhaustion. Feedback loops are widely used
in engineering to maintain systems at defined set points, and could constitute an effective strategy for
tempering excessive signaling in T cells due to chronic stimulation in the tumor microenvironment. To enable
feedback circuit design, we will first define the relationships between input signals, pathway output, and
downstream gene regulatory and functional responses. These input/output relationships are critical for
feedback circuit design, as they reveal how much signaling activity is elicited by different inputs and how much
is optimal for sustaining desired function, thereby defining the optimal system set points and feedback
strengths. We will measure these input/output relationships in T cells (Aims 1-2), utilizing a dual-pathway
reporter system we have developed that enables concurrent live-cell measurements of the activity of two key
signaling nodes, Erk and NFAT, in primary mouse T cells. Next, informed by these quantified input/ouput
relationships, we will identify genetic components for the actuation in this feedback controller, then proceed to
build prototype circuits and test their ability to boost antitumor T cell functions within in a mouse tumor model
(Aim 3). If successful, our work will define a new strategy to counter exhaustion for engineered T cell
therapies and establish a new paradigm for engineering self-regulating cell therapies that can maintain optimal
function through environmental sensing and internal adaptation."
10977588,"A hallmark of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is regional brain “iron (Fe) overload”. We hypothesize that life-
long exposure to inhaled Fe via air pollution (AP) is a contributor to elevated brain Fe and AD risk. In support of
this hypothesis, AP has been linked to increased risk for AD with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) associated with
increased risk for dementia, reduced memory, processing speed and increased cognitive impairment, PM2.5
exposures include ultrafine particles and metal contaminants. Of the many redox active metals/trace element
pollutants in AP, Fe is often found at the highest concentrations. Studies examining Fe in frontal cortex of AD
brains reported an abundant presence of magnetite (Fe2+/Fe3+ iron oxide) nanoparticles, consistent with an
exogenous exposure rather than endogenous Fe source. It is critical to note that metal contaminants in AP are
not borne equally by everyone. Low socioeconomic status (SES) communities show the highest AP and metal
contamination levels (Fe - top percentiles ~0.135 µg/m3). In fact, neighborhood-level SES measures associate
with memory and dementia risk. Further support for differential risk and the need to investigate inhaled Fe toxicity comes from the subway systems where Fe levels range 1000 x higher, from 141±81 to 329±116 µg/m3. These
“ambient” and “subway” level concentrations provide the rationale for our experiments evaluating the link
between inhaled Fe and neurodegenerative risk. Our preliminary data in mice demonstrates that inhaled Fe at
“Subway” concentrations (~135 µg/m3) increases brain corpora amylacea, elevates phosphorylated tau protein
levels, and results in female-specific hippocampal reductions and memory deficits. (AIM 1). We will evaluate
whether AD-associated phenotypes arise at lower, closer to ambient Fe level exposures (1.35 µg/m3) and
evaluate a time course of prodromal progression seen in AD studies, while differentiating between exogenous
inhaled Fe from endogenous Fe. (AIM 2) Further escalating risk in these communities, poverty-related stress is
characterized by a largely uncontrollable set of conditions, comprising a major risk factor for cognitive decline.
Higher perceived stress is associated with increased risk for mild cognitive impairment, and two or more stressful
life events increases risk for all-cause dementia. We predict that “ambient” Fe and deprived environments with
uncontrollable stress exposures will result in AD neuropathology and memory loss, similar to higher “Subway”
exposures. (AIM 3) We additionally predict that, conversely, enrichment with controllable stress will improve
memory and ameliorate deficits associated with “Subway’ level Fe inhalation. These outcomes will derive from
shared biological effects on oxidative stress and ferroptosis, with consequently increased neuroinflammation,
reactive astrogliosis with white matter damage and neuronal loss. This research will inform public health policy
and prevention to improve quality of life by mitigating cognitive and memory loss. Moreover, these studies
advance our mechanistic understanding of how co-occurring environmental stressors, with shared biological
consequences, can converge to enhance risk."
10992208,"It has been widely accepted that distinct epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and cancer stem
cell (CSC) properties as well as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in triple negative breast
cancer (TNBC) subtype account for the aggressive behavior of this disease. Although increased levels of tumor-
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in TNBC predicted better clinical outcome, the majority of these patients display
progressive disease due to the immunosuppressive TME. Although the clinical relevance of TME/pre-metastatic
niche in disease progression has been well recognized, the molecular mechanisms that regulate these
processes remain elusive. Preclinical and clinical data provide compelling evidence that immune cells of myeloid
origin (macrophages, neutrophils, MDSCs) are major components of the TME and predictive of poor prognosis
as well as therapeutic resistance. Therefore, further research is required to understand the underlying molecular
mechanism of formation of immunosuppressive TME/pre-metastatic niche and its role in disease progression
and therapeutic resistance. Our primary objectives in this application are; to determine how stress-induced
HSP70 regulates two fundamental processes; i) protecting tumor cells from cytotoxic cell death by inducing an
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype and ii) generating a permissive
microenvironment via the modulation of immunosuppressive myeloid cells. Our central hypothesis is that A20
induced HSP70 in TNBCs protects tumor cells from cytotoxic cell death while inducing an EMT phenotype and
inflammatory cytokines which in turn promote the accumulation of immunosuppressive MDSCs. Therefore,
targeting HSP70 will have a dual activity on tumors and MDSCs. Our rationale is that the identification of
molecular mechanism(s) that sensitize tumor cells to cytotoxic agents while reversing immunosuppression will
improve the effectiveness of currently available therapeutics. We previously demonstrated that growth of tumors
at metastatic sites is dependent of granulocytic MDSCs and suppression of anti-tumor responses and thus
blocking HSP70 in combination with standard of care and/or checkpoint inhibitors could have significant clinical
benefit. Based on these concepts we propose to test our hypothesis by investigating the following specific aims:
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that a reciprocal A20/HSP70 signaling axis provides cytoprotection to tumor cells
by inducing EMT/CSC phenotype in TNBC subtype. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that HSP70 regulates
immunosuppressive MDSC induction and acitivity. Aim 3 will determine the molecular mechanism and functional
importance of HSP70 in generation of TME and pre-metastatic niche. At the completion of our proposal, we
expect to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which HSP70 cytoprotects tumor cells from cytotoxic agents by
inducing EMT/CSC phenotype while regulating the immunosuppressive MDSCs in response tumor secreted
cytokines facilitating the tumor progression. It will also determine whether blocking HSP70 potentiates the
efficacy of the chemotherapies and/or immunotherapy in syngeneic mouse models representing TNBC subtype."

There is a global need to prioritize the development of a novel dental restoration that meets the criteria of being
long-lasting, easy to use, and accessible without complicated equipment. We aim to revolutionize dental care by
developing a cutting-edge platform for the rapid and precise creation of dental restoration materials. Our vision
is to tailor these materials to individual needs, adapting to the unique conditions of patients' oral environments.
Our innovative restorative system will include self-strengthening adhesives, bioactive fillers that respond to
biological signals, durable resins, and additives that provide new functions. Designed to be adaptable, this new
class of dental materials will be able to repair microcracks autonomously and prevent cariogenic biofilm.
Moreover, the easily applicable and durable restorative system will advance digital dentistry to a new level. Our
new approach integrates a physics-based model of testing and data-based simulations into the workflow of
material design and evaluation, this will drastically expedite the traditionally slow and costly route of material
development. Our ultimate goal is to introduce a novel operational platform in restorative dentistry, along with a
suite of multifunctional materials tailored for various dental treatments. Our diverse team, with expertise spanning
materials science, engineering, dentistry, and computational modeling, is committed to achieving this through a
three-pronged strategic approach. Aim 1 is to create a self-improving dental adhesive that enhances its bond
with the tooth substrate by facilitating mineralization at the interface. This auto-enhancing universal dental
adhesive (AUDA) will fill gaps between the tooth and adhesive, offering better adhesion than current products.
We will expedite AUDA development using hybrid modeling and simulation approaches (HMSA), which
incorporate data-driven multi-physics simulation techniques and create a virtual twin of the physical testing
environment. The performance of AUDA will undergo rigorous validation, including tests for bond strength to
extracted human teeth and durability under various challenges simulating human oral environments. Aim 2
focuses on crafting bioactive dental composites with self-healing and antimicrobial properties, achieved by
integrating innovative nanofillers. These composites that are designed to be compatible with existing dental
adhesives and AUDA will be validated for mechanical strength, bacterial inhibition, healing efficiency, and fatigue
life improvement. Aim 3 is to produce CAD/CAM restoratives optimized for digital dentistry, offering robust,
biocompatible materials with excellent aesthetics and bonding strength to teeth. Ultimately, our integration of
artificial intelligence and a virtual lab with the material development process in the physical lab will revolutionize
and individualize dental care. This platform will provide materials precisely tailored to meet diverse patient needs.
Successful completion of these Aims will generate a battery of novel bioactive multifunctional restorative
materials for precision placement and patients' needs. Its success will redefine dental restorative materials,
ushering in an era of personalized caries treatment."

adult-onset muscular dystrophy. However, congenital DM individuals are the most severely affected. While the
two types of DM are distinguished by the affected gene (DMPK in DM1, CNBP in DM2), both DM mutations are
tandem repeat expansions in noncoding regions. The mission of our Wellstone Center is to promote basic and
translational science that leads to safe and effective therapies for DM1 and DM2. An integral component of this
mission is our Administrative Core which oversees funding, compliance with federal and state regulations and
communication between our multi-campus personnel. The Administrative Core also coordinates, facilitates, and
monitors synergistic interactions between our Projects and Cores, basic science and clinical collaborators, as well
as patients, their families and advocacy groups. Additionally, we will continue to provide oversight to assure all
regulatory guidelines, privacy, and safety precautions are followed to recruit and enroll human subjects in the
proposed projects. To achieve these goals, Aim 1 is to continue the current Leadership of two principal
investigators at the Universities of Florida and Rochester who have successfully collaborated for over two
decades. These interactions have led to many notable accomplishments that have moved the DM field forward.
The only Leadership change is that the Director and Co-Director will switch positions so the host institution will
become the University of Florida, but the highly collaborative environment will remain as will the locations of
the Resource Core at the University of Rochester and the Training and Educational Core at the University of
Florida. Aim 1 also introduces a new Center Advisory Committee that will be composed of leading scientists with
expertise in short tandem repeat instability and disease, a biotechnology representative, and DM1 and DM2
patient advocates. Aim 2 will focus on managing and enhancing interactions between our Wellstone Projects,
Cores, and external collaborators to advance the utilization of our Shared Resource Core. Additional objectives
are to monitor adherence to our data and resource sharing plans that are designed to transmit new data and
promote collaborations with the larger DM1 and DM2 community of scientists, clinicians, and patients. Aim 3 is
to enhance the visibility of our Wellstone Center by increasing our research and educational outreach efforts to
inform stakeholders including researchers, patients, advocacy groups, and care providers through the use of a
new website, printed/electronic newsletters, social media, conferences, and videos that are designed to further
promote communication between investigators and patients about the diagnosis, clinical management and
research advances in DM1 and DM2. The Administrative Core will augment existing ties to the University of
Florida, the Myology Institute, Artificial Intelligence Academic Initiative Center, the Center for NeuroGenetics
and the University of Rochester Department of Neurology and the Clinical & Translational Science Institute and
use departmental resources at both campuses to facilitate the activities of our Wellstone Projects and Cores."

development or clinical trials. There is a significant need to ensure a sustainable pipeline of researchers who will
be well equipped to take on roles in all stakeholder organizations. On the clinical side, our training core will
supplement existing support for clinical fellows to introduce them to all aspects of DM biology, including
exposure to solid foundational bench science and enrichment activities involving visits to other sites around the
country. We will also focus on recruiting new clinicians into the field using an early engagement program for
medical students. On the bench side, we will focus on equipping scientists with the critical thinking,
communication, and presentation skills, and training them in cutting edge that will rapidly become
commonplace in the future. Both RNA and protein dysregulation occur in DM, and tools to study this disease
have moved from individual, candidate-based approaches to global approaches requiring significant
computational resources. The techniques that have been commonly applied include transcriptome profiling by
RNAseq, DNA analysis by whole genome sequencing and optical mapping approaches, and proteomics. More
recently, recognition of heterogeneity in gene expression across cell types and subcellular compartments of cells
and tissues have led to an explosion of technologies focused on spatial transcriptomics and imaging. All of these
techniques require competency in computation and programming, along a background of foundational biological
knowledge. Thus, overall, our training core will focus on 4 major priorities: 1) attracting and building competency
in the next generation of clinical investigators focused on DM, 2) rigorously training bench scientists in both the

Ploidy variation is a cancer hallmark and is frequently associated with poor prognosis in high-grade cancers.
Such variation can include an increase in chromosome set (polyploidy), a difference of chromosomes in a
set (aneuploidy), or regional ploidy changes and copy number variations (CNVs). Genome-wide studies of
multiple cancer specimens have shown that whole genome doubling is one of the most common molecular
abnormalities in human cancers and is closely linked to other copy number alterations. However, how
exactly polyploidy contributes to tumor growth, progression and malignancy remains largely unclear. Using
a simple and highly reproducible Drosophila tumor model, where an active form of Notch (NICD) drives
tumorigenesis in an epithelial transition zone (TZ), our preliminary studies indicate that tumor progression is
driven by occurrences of polyploid mitosis, endoreplication, and ploidy reduction divisions. Both polyploid
mitosis and depolyploidization are error-prone and can lead to chromosome abnormalities such as CNVs
and polyaneuploidy, resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity in DNA ploidy. Comparative RNA-Seq analyses
revealed that DNA damage response (DDR) genes are upregulated in these NICD-TZ tumors. Genetic
epistasis studies have further shown that some of these DDR genes are required for the ploidy reduction
division. Additionally, these tumors show sexual dimorphism regarding tumor growth and progression.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that polyploidy and associated cell-cycle variants are critical for
continued tumor growth and increased tumor-cell genome instability during tumor progression. To test this
hypothesis, we will carry out studies proposed in the following two aims: (1) to determine how polyploid cell
divisions contribute to tumor growth and progression; (2) to characterize the sexual dimorphism of the
NICD-TZ tumor model. The successful execution of the proposed studies will lead to a better
understanding of intratumor ploidy heterogeneity and cancer evolution, as well as improved strategies in
cancer prevention and treatment in a sex-dependent manner."
11001015,"This is an application to the Administrative Supplements for Continuity of Biomedical and Behavioral Research
Among First-Time Recipients of NIH Research Project Grant Awards (NOT-OD-23-032), granted for the PI's (Dr.
Maiko Suzuki) parent R01 grant (R01DE027648) entitled “Epigenetic and non-epigenetic role of SIRT1 in
fluoride-induced cell stress”. The PI's overarching research objective in the dental-oral-craniofacial field is to
identify environmental factors related to craniofacial pathophysiology and to develop novel preventive and
therapeutic strategies for environmental factor-associated oral diseases, including tooth malformation,
periodontitis and oral cancer. To attain the objective, in this supplement, the PI will develop the current R01
project into fluorinated compounds (per- and poly- fluoroalkyl Substances; PFAS), which are newly highlighted
as environmental pollutants. PFAS are a large group of artificial fluorinated organic compounds that have
generated increased public attention due to their toxicity and adverse health effects. The molecular mechanisms
of PFAS effects on dental-oral-craniofacial pathophysiology are largely unidentified. In the parent R01 award, we
focus on the molecular mechanisms of fluoride on enamel development. Our preliminary results demonstrated
that, as well as fluoride, fluorinated organic compounds PFAS could cause adverse effects on enamel formation
in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies have demonstrated the association between PFAS exposure and some types
of cancer. However, the PFAS effects on Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) are largely unidentified. In this
supplement, we propose to develop the parent research project into PFAS-mediated HNC pathology. The
objective is to determine the biological effects of PFAS on HNC in vitro. Our preliminary data suggest that PFAS
could promote HNC invasiveness and metastasis. We preliminary discovered that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA;
a most studied PFAS) increased the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and
promoted cell migration (wound healing assay) in a murine squamous cell carcinoma cell line (SCC7) in vitro.
SCC7 has been used as an oral cancer and head and neck cancer model in vitro and in vivo. Our previous study
demonstrated that fluoride and PFOA increased ROS generation to cause oxidative stress in ameloblast-like
cells. Based on our previous studies and preliminary data, we hypothesize that ROS may play a critical role in
PFOA-mediated cancer EMT and cell migration. This hypothesis will be tested by the Aim: To determine the role
of ROS in PFOA-mediated EMT and cell migration in murine and human oral squamous cell cancer (OSCC) cell
lines in vitro. Upon successfully completing this proposed study, the results will provide new insights that PFAS
could be considered a possible metastatic factor in HNC. Findings from this supplement and parental projects
will improve our understanding of the health effects of fluorinated environmental factors (fluoride and PFAS) on
enamel malformation and head and neck cancer pathophysiology."

 Current gold-standard diagnostic techniques for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) rely on behavioral
observation, and diagnosis is often not conferred until after age 4. This delay is unfortunate, because early
intervention can drastically improve outcomes. Given the rapid and sweeping changes in neural architecture,
cognitive ability, and behavioral repertoire that occur within the first year of life, identifying early-emerging
neurobiological markers that can predict abnormal neurodevelopment before behavioral symptoms manifest is
a public health priority. Following the onset of behavioral signs and symptoms, there is great need for stratification
biomarkers that can dissect ASD heterogeneity, thereby informing individualized treatment plans. Such a
precision-medicine approach necessitates greater understanding of the longitudinal pathways of development
in domains. This will set the stage for biomarkers that are sensitive to, and predictive of, changes in behavior
resulting from effective interventions.
 This proposal aims to identify and validate features of temperodynamic brain signal variability that can serve
as diagnostic, risk, and/or treatment response biomarkers of social dysfunction in ASD. Traditionally modeled
out of analyses as mere “noise”, measures of temperodynamic neural variability capture the inherently fluctuating
nature of the brain, which is increasingly understood to play a valuable functional role in the establishment of
neural networks and in the transfer of information throughout the brain. Temperodynamic neural variability has
been linked to cognitive performance, development, and autism.
 The current proposal will capitalize and expand upon this promising neurobiological marker to 1) identify and
optimize metrics for assessing temperodynamic neural variability by conducting the most comprehensive
comparison of time-series analytics of any study to date, and 2) establish these metrics as biomarkers for
neurodevelopmental outcomes by leveraging large clinical and longitudinal data sets consisting of multilevel
genetic, neural, and behavioral data.
 The proposed research extends the candidate’s prior work through new training in autism research,
translational developmental cognitive neuroscience, and timeseries and predictive analytics applied to large-
scale datasets necessary to advance biomarker development. These training goals will support the candidate’s
ultimate career goal of developing an independent research program dedicated to the use of interdisciplinary,
multidimensional, collaborative, and cutting-edge approaches to understanding the neurobiological and
developmental factors that contribute to individual differences in social behavior across the full continuum of
abilities – from healthy to disordered. The University of Virginia is committed to high caliber, collaborative
research and scientific preeminence in neuroscience, autism, and data science and will provide the ideal
environment for conducting this type of interdisciplinary, multidimensional child health-oriented project."
10978427,"Background: Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative diseases with accumulation of pathological
tau protein, termed tauopathies, are increasing in prevalence and burden to the US population. However, there
are still no therapies to cure or reverse tauopathies. Despite strong evidence that pathological tau causes
neurodegeneration and the development of numerous models of tau toxicity, the molecular mechanisms
underlying the toxicity induced by pathological tau are still incompletely understood. To discover novel genetic
suppressors of tau toxicity, forward genetic screening was performed in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of
tauopathy. A W292X mutation in SUT-6 (NIPP1 in mammals) was recently identified as a novel modulator of
tauopathy. SUT-6/NIPP1 is a multifunctional, multidomain protein that regulates phosphatase activity, splicing
of mRNAs, and gene transcription. The W292X mutant of SUT-6 removes the last 11 amino acids off the C-
terminus of SUT-6 and shows strong, dominant and cell-autonomous suppression of tau-induced toxicity while
loss of SUT-6 expression shows weaker suppression of tau-induced toxicity. This suggests that altering SUT-
6/NIPP1 interactions with protein partners that regulate phosphatase, splicing, or other activities leads to
suppression of tau toxicity.
Hypothesis: SUT-6/NIPP1 modulates tau toxicity by altering protein phosphatase 1 and/or splicing activity in
translationally conserved mechanisms of disease.
Proposal Aims: The specific aims of this project are: 1) Define the functions of SUT-6/NIPP1 important for
suppressing tau toxicity by introducing mutations into the sut-6 gene and evaluating the effects in a C. elegans
model of tau pathology. 2) Determine downstream mediators of SUT-6/NIPP1’s suppression of tau toxicity by
identifying neuronal interactors of SUT-6 and NIPP1 and performing epistasis analysis of identified interactors
in a C. elegans model of tau pathology. 3) Examine the translational impact of NIPP1 modulation on tauopathy
using a mouse model of tau pathology.
Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will deepen our understanding of a novel, translationally relevant
mechanism for regulating tauopathy and our overall knowledge of the mechanisms of tau-induced toxicity,
pathology and disease generally. This knowledge will lead to better therapeutic strategies targeting tau in
Alzheimer’s disease and other tauopathies."

The proposed research aims to unravel fundamental mechanisms behind neuronal survival across an
organism's lifespan, shedding light on specialized RNA regulation pivotal for prolonged neuronal resilience.
Essential for learning, memory, and environmental adaptation, mature neurons must persist throughout an
organism's life, yet our understanding of the intricate genetic regulations enabling this endurance remains
incomplete. Prior studies predominantly emphasized competition for external cues and growth factors in
establishing neural circuits and preventing cell death. Our research uncovers intrinsic genetic mechanisms
facilitating continuous neuronal survival. Notably, during differentiation, neurons alter their apoptosis regulation,
becoming more resistant to cell death triggers. This transformation coincides with global reprogramming of
apoptosis-related genes at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, resulting in the generation of
neural-specific alternative isoforms. A significant focus lies on understanding the role of specific gene elements
which exhibit crucial regulatory functions. We have determined a dozen of these splicing controls with
implicated functions in controlling neuronal survival and cell death. Our preliminary data show that splicing
alternation significantly impairs neuronal health. We propose three independent and interrelated overarching
aims for systematic exploration of these elements in influencing neuronal apoptosis. Additionally, by
investigating the impact of exon deletions and genetic manipulations, we seek to determine their continuous
necessity for long-term neuronal survival. Our interdisciplinary team, adept in genetics, neurobiology,
molecular cellular biochemistry, and computational biology, uniquely positions us to tackle these critical
questions. Through innovative methodologies and rigorous investigations, we endeavor to unveil neuron-
specific regulatory mechanisms governing apoptosis competence. Such discoveries may not only reshape our
comprehension of intrinsic neuronal survival strategies but also pave the way for novel strategies to enhance
neuronal resilience and combat neurological disorders affecting brain tissue equilibrium and circuitry formation."

Under homeostatic conditions, there is a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the
intestinal mucosa to provide a rapid response to pathogen while preventing aberrant tissue damage. In
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), disruption of this balance can lead to harmful inflammation resulting in
disease initiation or relapse. gd intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) provide the first line of defense against luminal
microorganisms and exhibit immunoregulatory capacity through the expression of CD39, which contributes to
the hydrolysis of extracellular ATP to adenosine. We and others have reported that the total number of gd IELs,
and CD39 expression on these cells, is reduced both in IBD patients and in a mouse model of Crohn’s
disease-like ileitis; however, the regulation of CD39 and its influence on gd IEL effector function remains
unclear. We now show that the frequency of immunoregulatory CD39+ gd IELs is decreased a month prior to
the onset of Crohn’s disease-like ileitis and the microbiota contributes to gd IEL CD39 expression. Further, we
recently described a novel transmissible gd IEL hyperproliferative (gdHYP) phenotype, in which the presence of a
unique microbiota increased gd IEL number and surveillance behavior. Our preliminary data show that WT
mice exhibiting the gdHYP phenotype also exhibit increased CD39 expression that is accompanied by a shift
toward mitochondrial metabolism and reduced cytokine production. Therefore, we propose to interrogate the
mechanisms by which CD39 expression is regulated in gd IELs, elucidate the extent to which CD39 is coupled
to gd IEL bioenergetic capacity, and investigate the intersection between antibiotic treatment and gd IEL
functionality in pouchitis. To address these questions, we will use a combination of ex vivo IEL culture,
IEL/enteroid co-culture, single cell metabolomics assays, and unique gd T cell-specific mouse strains to dissect
the molecular mechanisms involved in the upregulation of CD39 and immunometabolism in response to the
microbiota. Moreover, we will leverage access to retrospective and prospective longitudinal biobank samples to
both translate findings from animal studies and investigate the potential link between antibiotic therapy and gd
IEL CD39 expression in the context of pouch inflammation. These studies will further our understanding of the
cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in amplifying gd IEL regulatory function to maintain mucosal
homeostasis with the ultimate goal of preventing disease relapse in IBD patients."
10998840,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescence is when many individuals begin to seek increased levels of autonomy from their families and
experience pubertal-related brain changes, often leading to increased reward seeking and subsequent risk-
taking behaviors. Risky behaviors can lead to injuries, such as traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which in
adolescents and young adults account for a large portion of emergency room visits. TBIs can impact normative
brain development and put adolescents at elevated risk for increased mental health symptoms, such as
anxiety, depression, and addiction. In fact, peak substance use often occurs during the adolescent period of
development, (i.e., alcohol, nicotine, and cannabis) and TBIs may further increase this risk for substance
misuse through damage to impulse control regions of the brain, such as the frontal lobe. Personality factors
such as impulsivity may also predispose some adolescents to engage in more behaviors that culminate in TBIs
and increase risk for poorer health outcomes. However, little is known about the prospective relationships
between TBI history, mental health functioning, and substance misuse among individuals as young as 9-14
years of age. Therefore, this project will use data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
Study cohort to examine how mental health symptoms might mediate the association between TBI and
substance misuse behaviors and how trait impulsivity might moderate this association. These associations will
be examined longitudinally where TBI, mental health symptoms, and substance misuse will be examined at
baseline (ages 9-10), year 2 (ages 11-12), and year 4 (ages 13-14) using a cross-lagged panel mediation
model with baseline impulsivity as a moderator. The results from this project will inform behavioral challenges,
prevention strategies, and functional targets for intervention development for adolescents with history TBI."

The Genomics Research and Technology Hub (GRT Hub), the sole UCI genomics shared resource, is applying
for support to purchase a Hamilton LiquidScan NGS STAR (STAR). The GRT Hub was founded in 1999 and
has served the campus for microarray, DNA genomic analysis and mapping, bulk and single cell RNA
sequencing, and most recently multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics. Although physically located in the School
of Medicine, the GRT Hub is a short walk from all user schools on the UCI campus. In the last fiscal year, the
GRT Hub had $2.13 M in service recharges, the vast majority of which were to UCI investigators. The requested
STAR system will automate significant aspects of these next generation sequencing and beadarray workflows,
thus providing improved accuracy and reproducibility while relieving the stress of manual tasks currently
performed by trained staff. The STAR system will be located within the existing controlled environment GRT Hub
space. This workflow modernization is particularly critical with recent increases in throughput for both short- and
long-read sequencing platforms and the generous planned UCI campus support for acquisition of Revio and
NovaSeq X Plus in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Hamilton is an acknowledged leading manufacturer of robotic
systems. The basic unit, the Hamilton STAR, has throughput capabilities for single samples with needle or tip
loading and single up to 96 well parallel sample processing. Although every immediate workflow has associated
programs, including long and short read sequencing and beadarray as well as a physical module for liquid cell
and extracellular vesicle biomarkers, it is also readily programmable. The inclusion of an onboard thermocycler
extends the end-to-end processing for next generation sequencing library preparations among other
workstreams. This proposal has three specific aims: 1) automate NGS workflows for genomic and transcriptomic
library construction to increase efficiency of sample throughput, reduce errors in sample tracking, and increase
accuracy and precision in sample processing; 2) increase clinical genomic applications by attracting larger scale
projects and developing a specialized unit for biomarker assays; and 3) encourage others to consider
modernizing with a robotics training program for facility users."
10979458,"CPMV-Polymer Devices to Enhance the Outcomes of Intratumoral Immunotherapy
Steinmetz (PI) and her colleagues have developed a plant virus nanoparticle immunotherapy that
activates innate immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to launch adaptive, systemic, and
durable antitumor immunity. Specifically, we found that nanoparticles based on cowpea mosaic virus
(CPMV) stimulate a potent antitumor response in solid tumor mouse models and in canine cancer patients.
Intratumoral immunotherapy CPMV overcomes immunosuppression within the TME launching adaptive
antitumor immunity and immunological memory to prevent cancer recurrence. CPMV interacts with the immune
system in a multivalent manner, resulting in a cascade of events boosted by avidity to achieve unprecedented
potency. The intratumoral immunotherapy development pipeline is advancing quickly, but its
effectiveness faces challenges, necessitating better delivery methods. Key issues include: (1) Large
tumors often need more drugs or multiple injections, complicating procedures and possibly affecting therapy
results due to variability. (2) High fluid pressure in tumors, caused by factors like vascular issues and confined
cell growth, can impede drug delivery and even push drugs out of the tumor. (3) Frequent dosing can
discomfort patients (and/or owner’s when patients are dogs), affecting their willingness to continue treatment.
Therefore, we propose slow-release CPMV-polymer blend formulations for delivery as injectable
devices. CPMV will be incorporated into polymer blends by applying scalable hot melt extrusion (HME)
processing technology. Pokorski (MPI) is an expert in HME processing of biologics and our preliminary data
confirm the structural and biological stability of CPMV released from the device technology. Finally,
protein/polymer melts will be converted into injectable implants and microparticles using routinely available
milling and molding equipment. We will fulfill the following aims: First, we will formulate CPMV-laden slow-
release devices, establish and tune the release rates, confirm the structural integrity and biological activity
released CPMV from the delivery technology. Second, we will perform clinical testing to establish efficacy,
mechanism of action, and safety as a function of dose and delivery device. While the approach and CPMV
intratumoral immunotherapy is tumor-agnostic, we will focus on metastatic breast cancer. To mimic a patient
population with different subtypes of breast cancer, we will use immune-competent mouse models of
metastatic disease including models of triple negative breast cancer, HER2+ and ER+/HER2- tumors. Third, as
a prelude toward translation, we will perform a phase 0 canine trial enrolling canine patients with non-
metastatic and metastatic mammary tumors; in collaboration with Co-I Peña. Companion dogs with
spontaneous tumors provide a uniquely powerful resource that can be used for translational research as well
as treatment of someone’s well-loved pet."
10996020,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
Vocal deficits are highly prevalent and debilitating in Parkinson disease (PD). These deficits, like many others
mediated by the vagus nerve (swallowing, gastrointestinal (GI) function) appear prior to diagnosis, negatively
impact quality of life, and do not respond to current treatments that target dopamine modulation/motor signs.
The pathologic mechanisms underlying vocal deficits are poorly understood, especially in females. To address
these gaps in knowledge I will use a translational genetic model of PD, rats with a homozygous knockout of
Pink1 (Pink1-/-). PINK1 is implicated in early-onset autosomal recessive PD (PARK6), where mutations cause
mitochondrial dysfunction and early-stage clinical signs identical to sporadic PD. Loss of PINK1 results in
phosphorylation/aggregation of α-synuclein (α-syn) throughout the nervous system and I expect this occurs in
lower vagal brainstem regions during the prodrome. My preliminary data revealed vagal dysfunction in
swallowing and GI dysfunction, analogous to human PD, demonstrating feasibility and translational relevance
of this model. However, pathology and its relationship with vocal/other vagal dysfunction in the prodromal
stage, especially in females, is unknown. The central hypotheses of this work are (1) vocal behaviors/those
controlled by the vagus nerve decline during the prodromal stage of PD compared to age-matched controls, (2)
vocal/other vagal brainstem regions are susceptible to early-stage α-syn pathology, (3) there are sex-based
differences in brain and behavior manifestation. Based on the scientific premises that caudal brainstem regions
show α-syn pathology prior to rostral regions and nigrostriatal dopamine depletion, and that manifestation of
PD is influenced by sex, I propose to use male and female WT and Pink1-/- rats to study behavioral and
pathologic changes in vagal and non-vagal systems in the prodrome (4 mo). Aim 1 will evaluate differences in
vocal, other vagal (swallowing, GI), and non-vagal (limb motor) behaviors based on genetic (Pink1) and sex
conditions. I hypothesize measures of vocal/vagally mediated behaviors will be decreased in (a) Pink1-/- rats
compared to WTs and (b) Pink1-/- male rats compared to females. Aim 2 will assess pathologic α-syn in vagal
(nucleus ambiguus, nucleus tractus solitarius, dorsal motor nucleus of vagus) and non-vagal (substantia nigra)
brainstem nuclei. I hypothesize that pathologic α-syn in vagal nuclei will be increased in (a) Pink1-/- rats
compared to WTs and (b) Pink1-/- male rats compared to females. Aim 3 will identify relationship patterns
between vocal/other vagal behavior and pathological abnormalities in the lower brainstem. I hypothesize that in
Pink1-/- rats, pathologic α-syn in vagal nuclei will be inversely correlated with measures of voice, swallow, and
GI physiology. This work is innovative in revealing how vocal (dys)function (behaviorally and in CNS)
compares to that of vagal and non-vagal, and significant as I will address clinically relevant gaps in knowledge
in the prodrome, impossible to do in humans, to guide identification and treatment of voice. This work is central
to the fellowship training to prepare the PI for a tenured faculty position with an independent line of research."

 Sensorineural hearing loss, the most common form of hearing loss, is characterized by damage to inner
ear sensory hair cells or to the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that conduct auditory information from the hair
cells to the brain. SGN death can occur because of direct trauma, e.g., acoustic overexposure, or secondarily
after hair cell loss. Degeneration of SGNs can reduce the efficacy of cochlear implants that replace the function
of hair cells by electrically stimulating SGNs. The mechanisms that promote SGN death after hair cell loss are
unknown, however, mounting evidence suggests a causal role of the immune response.
 Neonatal rats treated with the ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic kanamycin lose all hair cells by 3 weeks of
age, rendering them deaf, and subsequently lose more than 80% of SGNs by 17 weeks of age. Gene
expression profiling analyses from the Green lab indicate that post-deafening, there is a significant increase in
the expression of immune response related genes in the spiral ganglion. This is accompanied by a significant
increase in macrophage number and activation up to two weeks prior to the start of significant post-deafening
SGN death. In addition, lymphocytes (CD4+ helper T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and CD161+ NK cells)
increase in number within the spiral ganglion concurrent with the first indication of significant post-deafening
SGN death. This increase in immune cell abundance and activation persists throughout the neurodegeneration
period, indicating a robust and prolonged immune responses occurs in the cochlea after kanamycin-induced
hair cell loss. I hypothesize that this immune response is causal to SGN death after hair cell loss.
 In this proposal, I will elucidate the function of macrophages and lymphocytes, independently, to determine
their involvement in SGN degeneration after hair cell loss. First, I will test the hypothesis that macrophages are
required for SGN after hair cell loss by evaluating three primary criteria. Using immunohistochemistry, I will
assess 1) SGN survival and 2) recruitment of lymphocytes (CD45+/IBA1- cells) in deafened PLX5622-fed
macrophage depleted rats. These experiments will indicate the extent to which macrophages are required for
SGN death and lymphocyte recruitment, respectively. In addition, I will use 3) qPCR to measure gene
expression of key chemokines/cytokines in the spiral ganglion to determine the extent to which macrophages
may be creating an environment neurotoxic to SGNs. Secondly, I will test the hypothesis that lymphocytes are
causal to SGN death after hair cell loss using the T, B, and NK cell deficient SRG rat strain. Together, the
results of these experiments will determine the extent to which macrophages and/or lymphocytes contribute to
SGN death after hair cell loss. These results will help guide the development of future therapeutics aimed at
preventing SGN degeneration after hair cell loss, ultimately improving the efficacy of cochlear implants."

Dry mouth affects nearly 30% of Americans, yet there are no treatments that effectively regulate saliva
production and composition long-term. Autonomic neurons innervating the major salivary glands have been
well-characterized and represent a main therapeutic target to trigger saliva production. However, this approach
only offers acute alleviation and results in unwanted side effects. Somatosensory neurons found in the
trigeminal ganglion initiate the detection of touch, pain, temperature, and chemicals in various craniofacial
tissues. Previous findings suggest that trigeminal sensory neurons innervating the periodontal ligament and
other oral structures initiate salivary-reflexes and indirectly contribute to saliva regulation. Now, our preliminary
data suggest that direct sensory innervation is also present. We hypothesize the direct trigeminal sensory
innervation of submandibular glands by Trp-positive trigeminal neurons provides feedback to modulate the
salivary system. The objective of this proposal is to determine the targets of Trp-positive trigeminal sensory
neurons innervating the submandibular salivary gland and the role they play in altering the secretion of saliva
volume and composition based on chemical cues. In Aim 1, we will combine viral vector, genetic, and
immunohistochemistry strategies to determine the central and peripheral targets of Trp-positive trigeminal
sensory neurons innervating the submandibular glands. In Aim 2, we will use in vivo calcium imaging and
chemogenetics to determine how this trigeminal innervation to the glands respond to chemical stimulation and
modulate saliva outputs. The submandibular gland maintains the continuous basal flow rate of saliva, thus
defining the function of Trp-positive sensory neurons present in this gland might reveal a long-term therapeutic
target to modulate basal saliva secretion. Overall, our results will for the first time provide a mechanistic,
cellular basis for novel sensory feedback and its role in saliva modulation. Furthermore, this research will
provide a foundation for determining how trigeminal innervation of the submandibular gland can be used to
address salivary gland dysfunction and provide additional therapeutic targets to counteract the loss of saliva."

Binge eating (BE) occurs in most eating disorders and at significant rates in the community, including among
children and adolescents. The chronic course of BE and significant psychiatric and medical morbidity further
attest to its public health significance. Critically, although males account for up to one-half of BE cases, there is
a paucity of research exploring risk for BE in males and studies exploring biological factors are nearly non-
existent. Adrenal and gonadal androgens are one set of male-specific biological factors that may be critical
given that they drive sexual differentiation and pubertal development in males, they cause changes in palatable
food intake in animals, and they are potent regulators of gene transcription within neurobiological systems
relevant to BE. Moreover, animal studies and our preliminary human data show that lower levels of androgens
(e.g., testosterone) are predictive of higher phenotypic levels of BE and stronger genetic influences on BE in
males during puberty, but no large-scale study has examined these biological processes. Larger-scale studies
that span the full range of pubertal maturation (e.g., adrenarche through gonadarche) and comprehensively
assess adrenal and gonadal androgens are a necessary next step that will enhance scientific Rigor and
provide critical Reproducibility and translational data. The long-term objective of the proposed work is to
identify the role of androgens on phenotypic and genetic risk for BE in boys during puberty. The Specific Aims
are to: 1) examine whether lower levels of adrenal and/or gonadal androgens contribute to BE in boys during
puberty; and 2) examine if genetic factors are mechanisms that drive phenotypic effects of adrenal and
gonadal androgens on BE in boys during puberty. Participants will include 1,000 same-sex male twins (ages 7-
17) recruited through the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Questionnaires and interviews will be
administered to the twins and at least one parent to assess BE, other mood/behavioral symptoms (e.g., mood,
anxiety), and the physical changes of puberty. Salivary samples will be collected and assayed for adrenal and
gonadal androgen levels. Multilevel structural equation models will be used to examine the phenotypic effects
of adrenal and gonadal androgens on BE during puberty. Latent twin moderation models will examine the
extent to which lower levels of adrenal and gonadal androgens are associated with stronger genetic effects on
BE during puberty. All analyses will also explore whether observed effects are independent of other factors
(i.e., adiposity, anxiety, depression) that change during puberty and are associated with androgens and BE.
Findings from our innovative, multi-method project have the potential to significantly increase understanding of
the causes of BE in boys by identifying androgens as novel neurobiological factors that contribute to BE.
Greater insight into etiological mechanisms of BE in boys will narrow the search for putative neurobiological
systems and genes and contribute to improved treatment and prevention of these syndromes."

Work from the past 30 years has established the importance of epigenetic mechanisms of silencing of tumor
suppressor genes. DNA methylation has emerged as one of the most common and conserved methods of
epigenetic silencing, causing loss of expression of thousands of genes. Epigenetic alterations are significant
drivers of tumorigenesis in all cancer types. Work from our group and others over the last 25 years has firmly
established that specific genes that become aberrantly methylated uniquely, early, and frequently in breast cancer
provide excellent biomarkers for breast cancer detection, prediction of response to therapy, and prognostication
of the course of the disease. In the parent grant, we have proposed a five-gene panel for accurate detection of
breast cancer in fine needle aspirates of suspicious breast lesions. Among them, Zinc finger (ZF) 671 (ZNF671)
is a powerful detection marker, since it is frequently methylated in breast cancer and a variety of other carcinomas,
but not in normal tissues. However, literature on its function is sparse; little is known about its upstream regulators
or its downstream targets. For this supplement, we will investigate the pathways through which ZNF671
functions. We hypothesize that ZNF671 will behave as a tumor suppressor protein in breast cancer cells, both in
cultured cells and in vivo. Based on the function of other ZNF proteins as embryonic differentiation factors, we
propose that loss of ZNF671 will lead to dedifferentiation, increased stemness, and acquisition of aggressive
neoplastic properties by cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we proposed two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
study the phenotypic and molecular changes brought about by overexpression and knockout (KO) of ZNF671 in
4 breast cancer cell line models. In Aim 2, since the ability for unlimited replication is dependent on the stem cell
population, we will test whether the presence or absence of ZNF671 influences the population of stem cells in
breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Through this proposal, the baccalaureate candidate will learn the
scientific process, and that of interpreting and reporting results. She will learn a variety of techniques to analyze
biological and molecular changes brought about by overexpressing or knocking down the expression of ZNF671
in breast cancer cells. Microarray analysis of breast tumor cells with KO of ZNF671, its data analysis, and

10996856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The United Nations and the World Health Organization have stated that empowering women is essential to
achieving the goals of health, development, and gender equality. Women's empowerment is a multifaceted
process, but it is still unclear how to quantify it and intervene most successfully. The societal contexts and social
environments of the communities where women live have a significant impact on women’s empowerment. Past
research has focused on individual level interventions to improve women empowerment but the effect of
community level interventions on women’s empowerment is not well studied. The purpose of this F31 fellowship,
entitled “Women’s Empowerment as a Result of the ECOLECTIVOS Trial (WERE)” is to study the effect of the
community level working group intervention and group participation on women’s empowerment. WERE is an
ancillary study of ECOLECTIVOS, an implementation research study (R01 ES032009, PI Thompson) that uses
a cluster-randomized village-level intervention (12 week working group sessions) to reduce the burning of plastic
waste in household fires. Women develop new skills, such as starting a recycling program or making handicrafts
from recycled plastic. Four hundred women in 16 villages will be recruited with 200 from the 8 intervention villages
invited to attend the working groups. WERE proposes to evaluate self-efficacy, household decision making,
social capital, and community mobilization to assess women’s empowerment at baseline (before randomization)
and 4 months later (after the working groups are concluded). The specific aims for WERE are: (1) To examine
the intervention effect on self-efficacy, household decision making, social capital, and community mobilization
within individuals over time and between the intervention and control groups over time (baseline vs.4 months);
(2) To study the effect of sociodemographic factors like age, socioeconomic status, and household size on self-
efficacy, household decision making, social capital, and community mobilization among both study groups using
multi-level modelling to account for individual and community level factors; and (Exploratory Aim) To conduct a
per-protocol analysis to whether higher participation in ECOLECTIVOS working groups, among the participants
of intervention group, shows a dose-response function in increasing household decision making, self-efficacy,
social capital, and community mobilization. Findings from this study will contribute to the scientific evidence on
the effects of community-level interventions on women’s empowerment at the individual level, in low resource
community settings like Guatemala."

Dysregulation of pancreatic islet function is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) progression. Thus,
understanding the exact mechanisms by which islet function can be preserved and regulated is crucial. It is
increasingly evident that α-cells play an important role in the potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
(GSIS), thereby expanding their function beyond that of the traditional counterregulatory role. However, the
regulation of intra-islet communication and its role in maintaining normal islet function remains incompletely
defined. Endogenous potentiators of β-cell function include glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). While
GLP-1 and glucagon both potentiate GSIS by binding to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) on the β-cell, GLP-1 is
300-fold more potent at promoting GSIS than glucagon. Canonically, glucagon is produced by the α-cell, and
GLP-1 is produced by the enteroendocrine L-cells in the gut. However, a growing body of literature reports that
under pathophysiological conditions, α-cells can produce and secrete active GLP-1. Our lab has identified the
signaling protein 14-3-3-ζ as a key regulator of α-cell endocrine profile. Specifically, we have found that β-cell
14-3-3-ζ ablation and inhibition increases GSIS and activates α-cell active GLP-1 production and secretion in
mouse and human islets in vitro. How β-cell 14-3-3-ζ expression is regulated and the role of the α-cell in the
impact of β-cell 14-3-3-ζ on islet function is unknown. Therefore, the driving hypothesis of this project is that
β-cell 14-3-3-ζ is a crucial regulator of α-cell to β-cell crosstalk. I will pursue our hypothesis in the following
aims: Aim 1 will define a new pathway regulating β-cell14-3-3-ζ expression. Specifically, our lab has found that
enhanced β-cell GLP-1R signaling decreases 14-3-3-ζ expression in the β-cell. I will study β-cells and mouse
and human islets to define the key signaling nodes by which β-cell GLP-1R signaling decreases 14-3-3-ζ
expression. Aim 2 will determine the efficacy of targeting 14-3-3-ζ in the β-cell to improve islet function in high
fat diet-fed mice. Aim 3 will determine the effect of β-cell 14-3-3-ζ ablation on bidirectional islet cell crosstalk.
Through these carefully designed experiments, I aim to shed light on a new crosstalk mechanism between α-
cells and β-cells, potentially opening new avenues for understanding and treating T2DM. The training plan will
be facilitated by the mentorship of my sponsor, mentorship team and the exceptional facilities and graduate
student support at UC Davis. This proposal describes an integrative and comprehensive training plan to support
my scientific and professional development and propel me toward my long-term goal of becoming an
independent researcher focused on the molecular underpinnings of metabolic disease."
10991047,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The cerebellum is an exquisitely laminated structure regulating balance, voluntary motor coordination and
modulating language and cognition through connections with the forebrain. Sitting just under the forebrain, the
cerebellum is estimated to contain roughly 80% of the neurons in the human brain. Accordingly, cerebellar
dysgenesis, pathology, or dysfunction is associated with a host of diseases or disorders, including ataxia,
autism, and intellectual deficit. Most cerebellar neurons are a subtype called cerebellar granule cells (CGCs),
which are generated embryonically from a structure termed the rhombic lip (RL)—a germinal zone residing at
the interface between the ventricular zone (VZ) and roof plate of the fourth ventricle. The mechanisms leading
to the specification of the RL germinal niche and subsequent generation of granule cells remain incompletely
understood. Specifically, the epigenetic and transcriptomic changes underlying how the ventricular zone
precursor cells take on the lineage fate of the RL are largely unknown. We have generated a novel conditional
knockout (cKO) mouse for TOX3, a member of the TOX family of transcription factors previously associated
with the regulation of epigenetics in T cells. Loss of TOX3 prior to RL specification leads to almost complete
agenesis of CGCs and 100% penetrant ataxia. We hypothesize that TOX3 mediates an epigenetic switch
necessary for the generation of cerebellar granule cell precursors from the rhombic lip and associated
ventricular zone—the loss of which results in developmental ataxia. Using a combination of state-of-the-
art single cell approaches spanning key developmental time points in this murine model system, we will
uncover the mechanisms by which TOX3 regulates cerebellar histogenesis.
We propose to carry out this work in two parts. The focus of Specific Aim 1 is to interrogate the epigenetic
and transcriptomic consequences of cKO of Tox3 using CUT&RUN for histone marks, and multimodal single-
cell RNA- and ATAC-sequencing to determine genetic networks regulating VZ/RL precursors and CGC
genesis. The main goal of Specific Aim 2 is to define the role of TOX3 on murine cerebellar lineages using
inducible Cre drivers and somatic mutagenesis."

 Females with sickle cell disease (SCD) in the United States face a health disparity triple threat as a result
of their chronic disease, race, and sex. In addition to overall reduced survival rates in both sexes and maternal
mortality rates that exceed those of Black females without SCD, females with SCD experience significantly more
frequent and more severe vaso-occlusive pain episodes (VOEs) compared to their male counterparts. However,
the pathophysiology of this pain disparity – whether biological, sociocultural, or both – is not understood. With
this proposal, we will test our central hypothesis, that female sex hormones modulate cyclic increases in
inflammation that predispose to VOEs. We will also explore whether and how gender modifies our proposed
relationship between sex, inflammation, and VOEs.
 SCD is characterized by chronic inflammation, with acute rises in inflammatory markers during VOEs.
VOEs exhibit a perimenstrual pattern, peaking during or prior to menses in many females with SCD. Our
preliminary data show that inflammatory markers may exhibit a similar pattern, peaking in the follicular phase.
Together, the established correlation between pain and inflammation and newer evidence of a cyclic pattern to
pain and inflammation in SCD lead us to postulate that female sex hormones mediate inflammation and VOEs.
Moreover, hormonal contraception may play a therapeutic role in SCD. Depot medroxyprogesterone (DMPA,
Depo-Provera®) is a progestin-only contraceptive that reduced VOE frequency in small studies. Since DMPA
suppresses hormonal fluctuations in the menstrual cycle, we hypothesize that DMPA may reduce cyclic
fluctuation in inflammation and thereby relieve VOE pain.
 The pathophysiologic pathway of perimenstrual VOE is likely multifactorial. The objectives of this study
are (1) to ascertain sex- and gender-related mechanisms of perimenstrual VOE and (2) to determine the
therapeutic effectiveness of DMPA on VOE and inflammatory biomarkers.
 We propose two prospective studies of patients with SCD recruited from university-based clinical
practices at the University of Pennsylvania and Johns Hopkins University. In Aim 1, “Inflammatory Biomarker
Patterns in Females and Males with Sickle Cell Disease,” we will evaluate traditional and functional inflammatory
biomarkers via serial blood sample collections across the menstrual cycle in 20 females with SCD, and compare
to serial biomarker levels over one month in 8 male controls with SCD. In Aim 2, “Clinical and Biomarker Effects
of Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate in Females with Sickle Cell Disease,” we will assess 52 females with
SCD pre- and post-intervention with DMPA to measure effects on VOEs and the same biomarkers. With these
studies, we plan (1) to demonstrate that key inflammatory biomarkers are modulated by both sex and gender
and (2) to determine whether DMPA prevents VOEs and reduces inflammation, and how gender affects these
outcomes. This research will form the scientific basis for new horizons for VOE prevention in females with SCD."

~2.4 million people in the United States have inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). While these severe and
debilitating diseases have a genetic component, as determined from concordance studies in monozygotic twins,
we still know very little about how genetics drives risk and progression for each disease. Genome-wide
association studies have identified hundreds of IBD-associated regions of the genome, but there is often tight
linkage disequilibrium between causal and non-causal variants in these regions, and most disease-associated
genetic variants are in non-coding regions. Thus, determining the variants that promote disease and their effects
on disease-relevant cell types is challenging. One cell type that is implicated in IBD is the pathogenic Th17 cell.
Th17 cells normally maintain homeostasis of the colonic lamina propria, but in the context of IBD, pathogenic
Th17 cells cause unwanted inflammation. Non-coding genetic variants associated with IBD are highly enriched
within the accessible chromatin of pathogenic Th17 cells compared to other T cell types. Thus, we hypothesize
that disease-causal variants alter cis-regulatory element (CRE) activity in pathogenic Th17 cells that may
affect their differentiation and function, making them more pathogenic. We recently discovered that we can
identify likely causal variants through testing their allele-specific effects on regulatory region activity in massively
parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Our MPRAs in T and B cell lines and primary T cells identify putative causal
variants that are highly cell type and state dependent. Thus, we will perform MPRAs on IBD GWAS variants,
identified in East Asian and European individuals, using human pathogenic Th17 cells to discover putatively
causal IBD variants across the genome. We will then connect variants to their effects on pathogenic Th17 cell
migration and function using CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screens in primary T cells. Next, we will use a
single-cell screening approach in pathogenic Th17 cells to identify the genes that variant CREs control. We will
then determine gene regulatory networks that variant CREs act on to begin to define important disease pathways.
In concert with our studies in human T cells, we will use in vivo CRISPRi screens to test conserved variant CRE
effects on migration and function of pathogenic Th17 cells in a murine model of IBD, thus exploring additional
physiological avenues of variant effects in the in vivo setting. If successful, this work will take the first leap
in directly linking hundreds of IBD risk loci to the function of a disease-relevant cell type and it will
provide insight into how genetic risk promotes disease. Our findings may therefore identify therapeutically
targetable pathways for treatment of IBD."

Despite remarkable progress in HIV testing and treatment, HIV incidence remains unacceptably high among
women and girls in eastern and southern Africa. In Uganda, HIV infections are concentrated among women at
elevated HIV risk due to factors such as working in venues where transactional sex is common. Although oral
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is being scaled up, many women at elevated HIV risk face barriers to
accessing oral PrEP at health facilities and to storing and adhering to pills. A new era of choice in biomedical
HIV prevention, including the dapivirine vaginal ring (DVR) and long-acting cabotegravir (CAB-LA), presents an
opportunity to reduce new infections. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) could fill gaps in coverage. As new
choices in HIV prevention are rolled out, strategies are needed to empower women to choose among
prevention products and support sustained use. Our study team developed and tested the SEARCH Dynamic
Choice HIV Prevention (DCP) intervention (including product choice: PrEP or PEP, with option to switch over
time, choice of facility or community-based visits, and provider training on patient-centered care). In three
randomized trials in outpatient, antenatal, and community settings, DCP increased time covered by a
biomedical prevention product over two-fold compared to standard of care prevention services. However, there
were gaps in engaging women who work in venues in the DCP model. We have conducted formative work, in
collaboration with our Community Advisory Board, to tailor the effective DCP intervention to further reach and
engage women at elevated HIV risk. Key recommendations from this work included increasing access to long-
acting product choices, expanding outreach beyond facilities, and extending existing peer services for HIV
prevention. Peer approaches are recommended in national guidelines and are being successfully implemented
to reach women at elevated risk for HIV testing and prevention services – but peer models have not yet been
deployed to deliver biomedical prevention choices. In this application, we propose to optimize and test a Peer-
led Dynamic Choice HIV Prevention intervention to catalyze choice and use of biomedical prevention products.
We will test the hypothesis that Peer-led Dynamic Choice HIV Prevention (with choice of oral PrEP, DVR,
CAB-LA, plus low-barrier PEP access) will increase biomedical prevention coverage compared to standard of
care among women at elevated HIV risk in southwestern Uganda. The proposed aims are: 1) To refine and
optimize the Peer-led Dynamic Choice HIV Prevention intervention; 2) To determine the effect of the Peer-led
Dynamic Choice HIV Prevention intervention on biomedical prevention coverage in a Hybrid Type 1
effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized trial; 3) To assess costs, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of
Peer-led Dynamic Choice HIV Prevention. Collectively, these aims will provide evidence for peer-led models to
deliver choice of HIV prevention products for women at elevated HIV risk to enhance HIV prevention coverage
using PrEP, DVR, CAB-LA, and next-generation prevention modalities."

 To this date, we are still uncovering the exact morphological and functional changes that retina cells
undergo throughout retinal degenerative disease timecourse. Furthermore, as common to many
neurodegenerative diseases, our knowledge is incomplete when it comes to understanding how these
morphological changes to cells affects their role in neural networks, as well as the factors that impact these
changes in connectivity. With this proposal, we will take what we have learned from multiscale
computational modeling of extracted early data from patho-connectomes, or connectomics volumes
constructed from early degeneration stages pathological or neurally degenerating tissues, and pursue
large scale network creation and modeling for all four stages of retinal degeneration. For model creation,
we will combine the construction of patho-connectomes of photoreceptor to ganglion cell pathways in each
stage of degeneration based on TEM images of diseased retina with a genetically-modified, monosynaptic
G-deleted rabies viral tracing approach to visualize distinct retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) projection classes
and characterize their unique dendritic morphologies. While the first (TEM-based reconstruction) provides
unprecedented detail of morphological features of the individual pathways to ganglion cells limited to small
areas of tissue and is not viable for mapping long range connections, the second (viral tracing) allows for
the reconstruction of the entire retina ganglion cell layer, for all stages of degeneration. Combined, these
two strategies will allow us to create a complete mesoscale connectivity atlas of retina and generate its
global neural network. This will be the “first of its kind,” large-scale, morphological atlas of the four known
phases of retinal degeneration, which will result in unprecedented knowledge of the neuronal changes
associated with eye diseases and the development of biomimetic therapeutics.
 These models will be integrated in our parallel multiscale Admittance Method (AM)-NEURON
computational platform, which integrates modeling of exogenous electric field application with neural
activity of complex networks to provide insights into the physiological consequences of morphological
changes on retinal signaling."
10999209,"This mentored F31 Award will provide the trainee, a PhD student in epidemiology at Stanford University, with
the training necessary to launch an independent research career in computational epidemiology with a focus
on neurological disorders. Under the guidance of a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, his training goals
are to: (1) develop advanced expertise constructing mobile digital tools to monitor neurological function, (2)
obtain proficiency integrating heterogenous data sources (digital app, electronic health record [EHR] and
imaging data), (3) use advanced statistical techniques (data mining, machine learning) to examine the value of
high-dimensional data in predicting clinical outcomes, and (4) gain additional proficiency in preparing
manuscripts for publication.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) impacts nearly 1 million young adults in the United States, characterized by acute
demyelinating brain and spinal cord lesions that cause accumulation of serious neurologic disability over time.
The disease course is extremely variable and relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common subtype,
affecting 85% of new onset patients. Treatment decisions are often made using limited cross-sectional data,
and even prospectively acquired MRI imaging and clinical assessments in the context of randomized trials are
too infrequent to capture the evolution of both clinical and subclinical disability as the disease course evolves.
To address these gaps, the candidate will use data collected from 143 patients from the Stanford MS Center
to (Aim 1) develop and assess a mobile app paradigm that uses high-resolution passively collected data to
retrospectively characterize mobility impairment outside of the clinic, and (Aim 2) improve prospective
monitoring of patient function using a trimodal paradigm that includes background collection of mobility
metrics, active Apple ResearchKit performance tasks, mobile app-administered surveys regarding patient-
reported outcomes (PROs). For both aims, the goal is to predict three outcomes (clinical relapses, Expanded
Disability Status Scale [EDSS], MRI measures) that will be collected from objective clinical and imaging data.
The proposal builds on extensive prior work of the trainee and his sponsors developing clinical research
grade digital tools. If successful, the paradigm will improve upon existing methods by being less costly and
less burdensome to patients, ultimately resulting in improved assessment of patients in both clinical and
clinical research settings."

Diabetes promotes cellular concentrations of the stress response protein Regulated in Development and DNA
damage 1 (REDD1) in the retina, which contributes to the development of retinal disease and impaired visual
function. Indeed, intravitreal administration of a siRNA targeting the REDD1 mRNA has demonstrated some
limited therapeutic benefit in improving visual function of patients with diabetic macular edema. However, the
approach was abandoned over a decade ago due to its failure to outperform vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) blockade, despite the partially effective results of this current standard of care. During the prior funding
period, we discovered that the REDD1 protein acts as a critical intracellular redox sensor. Specifically, formation
of a redox-sensitive disulfide bond acts allosterically to prevent the normally rapid degradation of REDD1 protein
in the context of diabetes. This discovery suggests that REDD1 mRNA knockdown may be a poor strategy for
reducing REDD1 protein abundance and activity in the context of diabetes. This renewal application is designed
to identify new evidence-based therapeutic strategies for preventing the retinal pathology that is caused by
REDD1. The rationale is that inhibiting the specific molecular events that lead to increased REDD1 protein
abundance or those that are responsible for its deleterious effects on vision may provide new interventions early
in the preclinical and non-proliferative stages of diabetic retinopathy (DR). The central hypothesis is that diabetes
activates the REDD1 redox sensor to promote glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3E)-dependent gliosis,
neurodegeneration, vascular permeability, and impaired visual function. Aim 1 will explore inhibition of REDD1
allostery as a therapeutic target for DR. The studies will evaluate diabetes-induced retinal defects in a new point
mutation knockin mouse that expresses a REDD1 variant that continues to be degraded even after redox-
modification. To complement this genetic approach, we will also use cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and
molecular binding assays to explore small molecule inhibition of REDD1 allostery as a clinically translatable
therapeutic for retinal disease. Aim 2 will examine a role for REDD1-dependent GSK3E signaling in the failed
adaptive response of retinal Müller glia to diabetes. The proposed studies will determine if Müller glial GSK3E
signaling enhances cytosolic calcium influx by promoting the expression of a stress-induced cation channel,
leading to downregulation of synaptic glutamate uptake and consequently retinal neurodegeneration. A new
Müller glia-specific MITO-Tag mouse will also be used to explore a role for GSK3E signaling in mitochondrial
permeability, mitochondrial DNA leak, and activation of STING (stimulator of interferon genes). Finally, the
proposed studies will use ribosome profiling of translationally active mRNAs isolated from the retina of diabetic
mice to characterize the reprogramming of Müller glia toward reactive gliosis. This project is expected to have a
powerful impact on the field, because it addresses a clinical need for therapeutics that provide interventions in
the early stages of retinal disease by targeting specific molecular events that cause loss of retinal homeostasis."

Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Innate Immune Memory: Mechanisms and
Consequences, organized by Drs. Shruti Naik, Keke Fairfax and Renato Ostuni. The conference will be held in
Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from February 2–5, 2025.
Inflammatory memory is a remnant of anti-pathogen responses that may be adaptive or maladaptive, leading to
inflammatory, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases, and cancers. This conference was designed to
highlight epigenetic mechanisms and consequences of inflammatory memory for human health and disease.
Sessions will focus on the mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of innate memory across a
spectrum of immune and non-immune cell types as well as the inter- and transgenerational inheritance of
memory and disease phenotypes. Other sessions will cover the contribution of inflammatory training to chronic
diseases and the role of environmental pollutants in inflammatory imprinting and disease susceptibility. This
conference will bring together experts in innate immunity, epigenetics, and disease biology, spanning diverse
cell types and disease indication, to facilitate interdisciplinary interactions in this emerging field. The conference
will be held jointly with the Keystone Symposia conference on T Cell Differentiation in Tissue Microenvironments
to enable cross-disciplinary insights and collaborations towards understanding interconnectedness of innate and
adaptive immunity. This provides a unique opportunity to understand non-cognate memory in adaptive immune
cells and the beneficial role of innate training in anti-pathogen and vaccine responses. In addition, the conference
will include panel discussions on controversial topics including mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance in
mammals and the role of inflammatory memory in inflammaging. This dynamic forum on inflammatory memory
will bridge several different research communities and provide insights that forecast future directions in
modulation of immune memory for therapeutics across a wide range of diseases."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common, aggressive and proliferative primary brain tumor in adults despite
current therapeutic strategies that combine surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. The high invasive capacity of
GBM makes total surgical resection virtually impossible, resulting in an extremely high recurrence rate. The
ability to form a new tumor resides in a subpopulation of cells within the GBM called brain tumor initiating cells
(BTICs). BTICs are undifferentiated cells with self-renewing and pluripotential capacity, similar to neural stem
cells (NSCs), but with the added ability of forming tumors in vivo. Our group and others have reported that
among primary GBMs, those that are located in close proximity to the lateral ventricles (LV) present multiple
factors, including increased recurrence at distant locations, that negatively affect patients’ survival. Possible
explanations may involve the proximity of these tumors to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neurogenic niche in
the subventricular zone (SVZ). We have previously reported that GBM tumors infiltrating the LV disrupt SVZ
homeostasis, inducing signs of senescence in NPC and allowing CSF infiltration. The ensuing interaction with
CSF heightens the proliferation and migration capacity of GBM-BTICs, fostering a more aggressive phenotype.
However, the mechanisms used by GBM cells to modify the SVZ niche and the LV wall are not understood. In
our preliminary studies we have observed extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in the intercellular
communication between BTICs and NPCs. The proposal's primary objective is to explore the role of EVs in
mediating communication between GBM cells and the tumor microenvironment, specifically within the SVZ.
Additionally, the research aims to evaluate EVs as potential biomarkers for monitoring brain tumor response to
treatment and predicting recurrence."

The overarching objective of our T32 application “AdvanceSGM Health for Research Diversity” (hereafter
referred to as Advance SGM) is to support the development of predoctoral trainees who will have exceptional
research and community engagement skills in advancing sexual and gender minority (SGM) health equity in
the Deep South. The rationale motivating our program is twofold: First, the need to recruit, retain, and raise-up
researchers from underrepresented backgrounds in an effort to understand and address the dramatic health
inequities facing SGM communities across our region. Second, the need to address SGM health holistically,
not just from a disease or deficits approach. We will provide predoctoral trainees with education and
experience in rigorous, reproducible, and transparent scientific approaches. We have designed our program to
include the following key activities: 1) Provide advanced training in SGM research through weekly seminars
focused on health equity, multi-level prevention interventions, methods, and their intersections; 2) Prepare
trainees for an academic research career via application workshops focused on professional development
training; 3) Engage trainees in SGM research via a shadow experience and community intensive for trainees to
‘learn by looking,’ followed by an immersive community-based participatory research project for students to
‘learn by doing’; 4) Expand trainees’ personal and professional networks through formalized mentoring and
networking opportunities; 5) Evaluate the effectiveness of AdvanceSGM in increasing the diversity of scholars
addressing SGM health equity across racial, ethnic, SGM, and other minoritized statuses. The planned
duration of appointments is two years per cohort. We project a total of 15 trainees across three cohorts
(1st cohort years 1 and 2, 2nd cohort years 2 and 3, final cohort begins in year 5 and continue their final year
upon T32 renewal). We will draw on our diverse personal and professional networks to recruit applicants from
underrepresented backgrounds designated by NIH (e.g., experience with homelessness, educationally and/or
financially disadvantaged, raised in rural and/or Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services-designated low-
income areas) alongside other systematically excluded groups (e.g., race and ethnicity, sexual minority, gender
minority). Prospective UAB doctoral students, as well as current doctoral students already enrolled in the
Schools of Public Health, Nursing, or College of Arts and Sciences and who are in years 1 or 2 of their
program, are eligible. Intended trainee outcomes will include traditional NIH evaluation metrics (e.g.,
presentations, publications, and grants submitted and awarded) in addition to other critical metrics such as the
extent to which the training contributed to the development and growth of professional networks among
trainees. This will be assessed through a robust mixed methods evaluation plan."

Motor vehicle crashes (MVC) are the leading causes of death among teens with eight teens dying per day in
an MVC. Teens with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are at twice the risk of MVC compared to
teen drivers without ADHD. A programmatic line of research by this investigative team has identified long (>2
secs) glances away from the roadway, particularly during engagement with secondary tasks, as being a key
mechanism in ADHD teen driving risk. In the original research grant, the investigative team developed and
tested a driver training program, enhanced FOcused Concentration and Attention Learning (FOCAL+), to
specifically target reducing rates of extended glances away from the roadway in teens with ADHD. In a
randomized controlled trial (RCT), teens with ADHD randomly assigned to FOCAL+ demonstrated 41% fewer
long-glances and less variability in lane position during simulated driving assessments conducted immediately
after the final training session, and 1- and 6-months post-training compared to teens assigned to modified
driver's training. Moreover, during naturalistic driving over the course of a year of driving, FOCAL+ teens had
40% less risk of a crash/near-crash event than control teens. However, there are considerable barriers to
disseminating FOCAL+ in its current format. FOCAL+, as implemented in the RCT, requires costly (~$90K)
hardware and software that are quite complex to use. Though there has been much interest in offering this
training since publication of our RCT results, key stakeholders have reported that the expense and complexity
of the hardware and software requirements are barriers to adoption. In the proposed study, with input from
relevant stakeholders, FOCAL+ training will be converted to an immersive virtual reality (iVR) platform. iVR-
FOCAL+ will provide an affordable ($5K), single hardware, single software, easily-executable solution that
implementation sites (i.e., driving schools, outpatient occupational therapy) will be able to afford, adopt, and
offer to teens with ADHD. Using a Type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation design, teens with ADHD will
be randomly assigned to receive either iVR-FOCAL+, the original FOCAL+ or a sham control group. The iVR-
FOCAL+ training will be implemented in real-world, non-research settings (i.e., driving schools, outpatient
occupational therapy). At baseline and 1- and 6-months post-training, teens' driving skills will be assessed
during driving simulation. Naturalistic driving will be assessed during the year after training using video event
recorders installed in the teen's car. Training costs and implementation outcomes (e.g., barriers to
implementation) for each training will be collected. Using these data, we will examine the relative effectiveness
and cost-effectiveness of iVR-FOCAL+ intervention compared to FOCAL+ training. Finally, implementation of
iVR-FOCAL+ will be tested and described. The proposed research has the potential to facilitate adoption and
eventual dissemination of a training program that can prevent injuries and fatalities among a high-risk
population of teens as well as among those who share their roadways."

Placental dysfunction leads to pregnancy-associated disorders, including intrauterine growth restriction
(IUGR) and preeclampsia, and also serves as a developmental cause for postnatal and adult diseases. Often,
the causal alterations in the placentation process, which lead to defective pregnancies, occur early in
gestation. Defective development and differentiation of trophoblast progenitors are leading causes for
pathological pregnancies. However, we have a poor understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate
trophoblast progenitor self-renewal, differentiation and function in postimplantation embryos. Studies on
mutant mouse models revealed that RNA Methyltransferase 3 (METTL3), which catalyzes N6-methyladenosine
(m6A) modification on eukaryotic RNAs, is important for embryonic development. Furthermore, METTL3
expression is upregulated in pathological pregnancies, associated with Preeclampsia and IUGR. However, the
importance of METTL3 in the context of mammalian placentation is poorly understood. Our preliminary findings
establish that METTL3 expression is conserved in trophoblast progenitors across mammalian species, including
humans. We also found that METTL3 is essential in human trophoblast self-renewal. Thus, the overarching goal
of this proposal is to investigate importance of METTL3 in the mammalian placental development and
maintenance. We will also test how altered METTL3 function in the placenta affects fetal development leading to
IUGR.
 Two specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1 we will study Mettl3 conditional knockout and Mettl3
conditional overexpression mouse models to test the hypothesis that trophoblast cell-autonomous function of
METTL3 is important placental development and maintenance. We will test role of METTL3 in trophoblast
differentiation, invasion and fetal development.
 In Aim 2, using CTB-derived human trophoblast stem cells, we will test the hypothesis that METTL3
establishes a conserved gene expression program in mouse and human trophoblast progenitors and impairment
of METTL3-dependent transcriptional program will impair self-renewal and differentiation potential of human
trophoblast progenitors. In addition, we will also interrogate significance of METTL3-dependent mechanisms in the
context of pathological pregnancies associated with IUGR , especially early-onset IUGR."

the American Academy of Pediatrics, and American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, recommends universal
suicide risk screening, assessment of acute suicide risk, and safety planning (hereafter “suicide prevention”).
However, the effectiveness of primary care suicide prevention in teens is unknown. Moreover, concern about
confidentiality is a primary reason teens do not disclose suicide risk and more than half of teens in primary care
do not receive confidential care (including assure of health information privacy and time alone with a provider).
Implementation of suicide prevention with confidential care may be most effective for improving suicide
outcomes and will need to address barriers to confidential care. We designed universal suicide prevention with
confidential care for teens in partnership with diverse stakeholders in an integrated health system, building on
a pragmatic trial that decreased suicide attempts in adults. Teen suicide prevention was designed with EHR
support to prompt screening and follow-up and practice facilitation to address barriers. After piloting, health
system leaders implemented teen suicide prevention in 30 primary care practices statewide (serving ~8,200
teens with preventive visits annually), with a first implementation phase of systemwide launch of EHR support
followed by a second phase of 10 weeks of practice facilitation staggered by region and completed July 2023.
This study takes advantage of this natural experiment to conduct a quasi-experimental, hybrid type-2
pragmatic implementation study. We test the extent to which implementation of population-based teen suicide
prevention with confidential care improved outcomes during the 3 years after implementation launch (i.e., 3
years of intervention) compared to usual care (4 years prior to launch). SPECIFIC AIMS. Among teens 13-17
years old with preventive visits, we will: 1) test the extent to which implementation of the teen suicide
prevention with confidential care increased the prevalence of safety planning (and secondarily, suicide risk
screening, assessment and confidential care) in teens by comparing 3 years of intervention to 4 years of usual
care; 2) test whether implementation of teen suicide prevention reduced suicide-related events in the 6 months
after a preventive visit by comparing 3 years of intervention to 4 years of usual care; and 3) test whether
receipt of confidential care, compared to no receipt, is associated with greater increases in teen safety
planning in the 3 years of intervention. Secondarily, we will test whether outcomes differed by implementation
phase and assess implementation barriers, facilitators and costs. IMPACT: The real-world reach and
effectiveness of implementation of teen suicide prevention with confidential care is unknown. More than 50% of
teens who die by suicide had a primary care visit within the past year. This study tests whether implementation
of teen suicide prevention with confidential care improves outcomes. If effective, this practical primary care
intervention could be implemented nationwide, preventing a large number of teen suicide deaths each year."
10977266,"Excess risk for Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (ADRD) persists among older Black and Latino adults.
ADRD prevention research has focused on individual vascular risk factors, with less attention to ubiquitous and
modifiable environmental stressors. Environmental stressors may not only determine who is exposed to
vascular risk factors but also how severely those risk factors increase ADRD risk.1 Black and Latino individuals
experience lower access to green space, higher exposure to air pollution, noise, extreme heat, neighborhood
deprivation and violence. Prior evidence examining each of these environmental factors suggest adverse
associations with vascular risk factors for ADRD. Yet, environmental stressors are experienced in combination,
rather than in isolation. It is critical to evaluate the joint impact of multiple domains of environment exposures
as features of the external exposome. Even less is known about the differential impact of environmental
stressors by race/ethnicity and whether these differences account for ADRD disparities. To address this
significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the impact of combined environmental stressors on stroke and
vascular risk factors for ADRD. We will leverage resources from 3 U.S cohorts with substantial racial and
ethnic diversity, with up to 20 years of follow-up. In these cohorts, we have individual-level and objectively
assessed cognitive level, cognitive decline, and neuroimaging biomarkers of ADRD in older adulthood. We
hypothesize that individuals exposed to higher environmental stressors (lower access to green space, higher
exposure to air pollution, noise, extreme heat, neighborhood deprivation and violence) will have higher ADRD
risk in older adulthood (Aim 1), and vascular risk burden at midlife (45-64 years; Aim 2). We also hypothesize
that the association between the environmental stressors with ADRD and vascular risk factors will vary among
race and ethnicity sub-groups, and that a large fraction of dementia cases in the US will be associated with
combined influence of modifiable environmental stressors, especially for Black and Latino individuals (Aim 3).
We will leverage massive exposure datasets, coupled with individual-level data and advanced statistical
methods, to overcome the limitations of prior studies and provide actionable evidence on ubiquitous modifiable
environmental stressors. We will identify combinations of modifiable environmental stressors that may reduce
racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD and vascular mechanisms of ADRD. Our findings will provide a
foundation to develop actionable items to prevent or mitigate ADRD inequities. The comprehensive multi-
dimensional spatial datasets and approaches developed in this project will be applicable to other
epidemiological studies that consider biological and behavioral pathways through which environmental stress
affects neurovascular health."
10977472,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol directly stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a primary stress system, initiating the
release of glucocorticoid hormones. Preclinical work indicates that chronic alcohol exposure increases both
brain and peripheral corticosterone in rodents, with some studies suggesting greater increases in the brain.
These increases in rodent brain glucocorticoid levels are prolonged and persist long after plasma
corticosterone returns to baseline. Thus, brain glucocorticoid dysfunction may underlie long-lasting, persistent
alcohol use. Studies of HPA axis dysregulation in humans with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have only examined
peripheral cortisol in relation to alcohol and with mixed results. Chronic alcohol use is associated with both
elevated and blunted levels of peripheral cortisol in response to alcohol and stress in individuals with AUD. So,
what we know about HPA dysregulation in AUD is based solely on peripheral cortisol, and results are
inconsistent and incomplete because we have not been able to study a marker of brain cortisol - forming a
significant gap in the existing literature. Translating preclinical findings in the brain to human AUD and
examining the relationship between brain-peripheral cortisol is a critical next step in understanding HPA
dysfunction in this population. Levels of glucocorticoids in the brain are dependent on the enzyme 11β-
Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1), which catalyzes the conversion of cortisone to cortisol (or
corticosterone in rodents). 11β-HSD1 is expressed in brain regions critical to alcohol addiction, including the
amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Using a novel radiotracer called [18F]FMOZAT together with Positron
Emission Tomography (PET) brain imaging, we can now measure levels of 11β-HSD1 in the living human
brain. Using these methods, we have exciting preliminary data (obtained through K01AA025670) suggesting
that individuals with AUD (n=9) have higher 11β-HSD1 availability compared to healthy controls (n=12) in
prefrontal-limbic regions. Preliminary data also demonstrate that 11β-HSD1 availability in ventromedial PFC is
associated with drinks per week, quantity of drinks per drinking episode, and AUD severity. However, we do
not know how 11β-HSD1 availability in brain corresponds to peripheral cortisol in humans, and whether brain
vs. periphery predicts drinking behavior. This proposal will derive critical foundational information on brainperiphery
HPA axis dysregulation by: fully characterizing both availability of 11β-HSD1, a cortisol regenerating
enzyme, in brain and peripheral cortisol in those with AUD vs. healthy controls, and determining whether brain
vs. periphery predicts drinking behavior (Primary Aim 1). We will also evaluate whether 11β-HSD1 availability
vs. peripheral cortisol predict stress-related drinking using EMA and a biosensor system in individuals with
AUD compared to healthy controls (Exploratory Aim 2). This will build the future foundation for additional
mechanistic studies probing the HPA axis and provide needed data to support translational upstream HPA axis
targets as AUD treatments in humans."
10977883,"ABSTRACT
Modifiable risk factors, including diet quality, have a significant impact on disability and life expectancy. Social
network analyses demonstrate that social connections play a role in initiating and reinforcing these risk factors
through mechanisms such as mutual support and information exchange, as well as social influence pathways
like modeling, the establishment of social norms, and persuasion. Though the literature on social networks and
health behaviors, including network interventions, has grown substantially, key populations and issues remain
under-investigated, such as networks of midlife adults, the impact of social selection (e.g., homophily) alongside
peer influence, and the equitable distribution of intervention effects. Further, given that network interventions
target small numbers of recipients and benefit larger numbers in a population, cost-efficiency is an important, yet
often neglected, metric of intervention success. The proposed study will address these research gaps by
conducting simulations to identify how workplace health behavior interventions can best capitalize on social
connections to have the most positive, equitable, and cost-effective impact on health behavior outcomes for
midlife adults. Our simulations will be built from a stochastic actor-oriented model (SAOM), a statistical network
model that simultaneously estimates the formation and dissolution of social ties alongside the transmission of
health behaviors. The model will be estimated using empirical data from prior studies testing the impact of a
healthy eating intervention employing social norms feedback and other behavioral nudges on the healthfulness
of employee cafeteria purchases within a workplace social network. We will map out the scenarios in which
interventions leveraging social networks have the most positive and equitable impact on employees’ healthy
purchasing. We will also assess how changing model parameters will shape intervention costs and cost-
effectiveness. Our specific aims are: 1) Develop, parameterize, and calibrate an SAOM simulating a network
including midlife employees (ages 50-64) within a socioeconomically diverse workforce based on empirical data.
2) Use the SAOM to manipulate the targeting strategy, effect size, durability, and social transmissibility of a
healthy eating intervention and run simulations to understand which characteristics of the intervention maximize
the healthfulness of employee food purchases. At the same time, we will assess the incremental cost-
effectiveness of alternate targeting strategies. 3) Across intervention targeting scenarios, use the SAOM to
manipulate aspects of social selection and heterogeneous peer influence by sociodemographic characteristics
to identify circumstances where interventions mitigate or exacerbate sociodemographic disparities in healthy
purchasing. Throughout, we will focus on employees in midlife (ages 50-64) embedded in this broader social
network. This work responds directly to RFA-AG-24-025 by modeling the impact of intervention, interpersonal,
and network characteristics across a range of scenarios to pinpoint effective, equitable, and cost-effective health
behavior interventions that can then be tested in more direct but more costly empirical randomized trials."
10977884,"This study aims to identify and understand the role of environmental stressors in the development of Alzheimer’s
Disease-Related Dementias (ADRD) and related health inequities across urban and rural populations. We will
recruit 600 participants (300 urban dwelling and 300 rural dwelling) from the U.S. State of Indiana at high risk for
developing ADRD. High risk individuals will be identified by analyzing passive digital markers (PDM) in electronic
health record (EHR) data using a validated algorithm developed and tested by our research team in a currently
funded NIA R01. Participants will complete a cognitive assessment based on the Uniform Data Set (UDS) 3.0
from the NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Center program to determine eligibility at baseline. Only individuals with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) will be enrolled in the study. Following a process utilized in our currently funded R21
data collection, each enrolled participant will then report their stressors for a two-week period using our novel
Stress Reports in Variable Environments (STRIVE) mobile ecological momentary assessment (EMA) app while
wearing a smartwatch to track their activity level, heart rate, and sleep. Our custom built STRIVE app passively
collects GPS coordinates of participants every 60 seconds and participant initiated self-reports of stressors,
including description, subjective severity, coping response, and photo of stressful environment. We will conduct
qualitative thematic analysis of text- and image-based stressor data. These measurements will be used as
indicators of each participant’s ‘usual environment’ as well as experience of and exposure to environmental
stressors. We will continue to monitor PDMs in participant EHR data and administer cognitive assessments 12
months, and 24 months to determine if subjects convert from MCI to ADRD. Through this research, we will
address 2 aims: 1) To determine where, when, and what environmental stressors are experienced by urban and
rural dwelling individuals at high risk for ADRD, and 2) to determine inequities in the relationship between
environmental stressors, lived environment, and conversion to ADRD between urban and rural dwellers.
Completing these aims will advance knowledge of 1) How environmental stress plays a role in ADRD health
inequities; 2) New environmental stress-related therapeutic targets for treatment of ADRD; and 3) New
interventional strategies based on validated stress factors to mitigate ADRD health disparity between urban and
rural environments."
10976832,"Compound heterozygous missense mutations of the SLC25A1 gene give raise to combined D/L-2-
HydroxyGlutaric Aciduria (D/L-2HGA) [1-10], a disease hallmarked by the accumulation of the two enantiomeric
forms of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2HG), D and L. D/L-2HGA is considered a rare disorder, with 150 cases
described worldwide. Both enantiomers of 2HG are thought to be neurotoxic during development based on the
clinical manifestations seen in patients with L- or D-2HGAs. However, their specific functions in normal cells and
tissues remains unclear. The main activity of Slc25a1 consists of promoting the efflux of the lipid precursor,
citrate, from the mitochondria into the cytosol, where citrate provides the main source for lipid biosynthesis. The
current model thus envisions that lack of Slc25a1 mitochondrial transport activity leads to a deficit in the cytosolic
citrate pool in turn hampering lipogenesis. Consequently, supplementation with dietary citrate has been
advocated and clinically attempted, but the prognosis of these patients is still dismal. Our current work
challenges this dogma and is paradigm shifting in several aspects. We have developed the first murine models
of Slc25a1 deficiency (Slc25a1-/- mice) and we have discovered that the phenotypic alterations in these animals
recapitulate those seen in the currently known human disorders of combined D/L-2HGA. We used a multifaceted
approach inclusive of biochemical studies, metabolomics and transriptomic profiling to identify the pathways
altered in Slc25a1-/- mice. As expected, Slc25a1-/- accumulate 2HG in all body fluids hence providing a novel
model of 2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria. However, in contrast with the prevalent mechanistic view of this disease,
Slc25a1-/- mice compensate for lack of cytosolic citrate by igniting alternative pathways for citrate production
which in turn lead to excess citrate and lipid build up. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed the enrichment of
gene sets involved in inflammation and in the induction of premature senescence. Similarly, fibroblasts derived
from patients affected by D/L2HGA harboring loss of function Slc25a1 mutations, also undergo premature
senescence. Finally, we report here for the first time that the D- and L- 2HG enantiomers are able, per se, to
induce senescence in normal cells. Thereby empowered by the availability of both murine and human models of
Slc25a1-driven 2HGA, the main scope of this proposal is to solve two standing conundrums in the field: first, we
will identify the pathways by which D/L-2HG is produced in the context of Slc25a1 mutations or Slc25a1 loss.
Second, we will assess, for the first time, how D/L2HG affect embryonic development with the specific intent to
dissect pathogenic events unrelated to- or sustained by- 2HG accumulation. We predict that these studies will
enlighten metabolic and molecular pathways that can be targeted in the future and will ameliorate the outcome
of devastating disorders associated with Slc25a1 loss."

Despite extensive research documenting the existence of pervasive health inequities over the lifespan, there
is little research on preventive interventions to address these inequities. Thus, there is an urgent need to
train the next generation of public health professionals, especially those from historically marginalized
backgrounds, to be equipped with a comprehensive toolkit to confront these challenges. The UC Berkeley
Training HealthEquity ScholaRs in InnoVation, PrEvention, and Social Impact (UCB-THRIVES) T32
Fellowship Program proposes a collaboration between three graduate groups in the School of Public Health
(UCB-SPH): Epidemiology, Health Policy, and Environmental Health Sciences. The overarching objective is
to equip the upcoming generation of health equity scholars with the structural competency and
methodological acumen required to develop and evaluate multi-level, preventive interventions to address
health equity in partnership with marginalized communities. UCB-SPH is uniquely positioned to provide this
training due to its pioneering leadership in social epidemiology, community-engaged research, and
advanced statistical methods in causal inference. Furthermore, UCB-SPH demonstrates a profound
commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging, and justice, which will be leveraged to create a rich
training environment for pre-doctoral students. T32 trainees will receive innovative classroom training in
health equity, multi-level interventions, and methods in multi-level preventive interventions through
coursework and immersive research experiences, and they will be guided throughout by Individual
Development Plans. The core training domains will be supplemented with three salient cross-cutting themes
critical to achieving health equity: 1) community engagement, 2) anti-racism, and 3) social impact. The
UCB-THRIVES T32 Program has an excellent leadership team with Drs. Mujahid and Fernald serving as

This is a multi-PI project in which the 3 PIs each have a set of unique, but complimentary, cutting-
edge technologies, patient resources, and computational tools that together enable us to fill a key
knowledge gap: what are the upstream pathways that drive the chronic production of type I
interferons (IFN-Is) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)? Our work with focus on innate
immune cells (neutrophils and monocytes) and skin biopsies from SLE patients (compared to
healthy donors) obtained at the University of Washington and the University of Michigan,
respectively. These samples will be subjected to ultrasensitive protein detection and protein-
bound nucleic acid sequencing at Rockefeller University, as well as joint experiments in the first
two labs. We anticipate that the synthesis of data from these approaches will be transformative
for our understanding of SLE pathogenesis and the molecular mechanisms of lupus flares. Our
aims are:
AIM 1. To identify the NA(s) that triggers IFN-I production in SLE neutrophils and monocytes.
Because SLE is a systemic disease involving numerous cell types, including immune cells, we
focus this aim on neutrophils and monocytes. This choice is in part based on many recent papers
indicating that they play an important role in SLE and in part because our preliminary data show
that neutrophils are much altered in this disease, contain all the components for nucleic acid
sensing and IFN-I production, and are the lineage with the highest retrotransposon expression.
Monocytes likely play a (similar?) role in SLE. In this Aim, we will focus on identifying the nucleic
acid species that are associated with the nucleic acid sensors that drive IFN-I using ultrasensitive
detection methods.
AIM 2. To identify the pathogenic DNA species that triggers IFN-I production in lupus skin. The
skin is a key location of pathology in SLE patients. Ultraviolet (UV) light triggers flares of rashes
and systemic disease in SLE patients, yet the reasons for this are unknown. IFN-Is are chronically
upregulated in SLE epidermis, drive inflammatory responses in the skin, and are dysregulated
after UV light exposure such that more IFN-I is produced in SLE vs. healthy control skin. The
reasons for increased IFN-I production in SLE skin remain undefined yet are critical targets for
novel therapeutic development and flare prevention. In this Aim, the macromolecular aggregates
of nucleic acid sensors and the associated nucleic acids will be identified in keratinocytes before
and after UVB exposure and the source of the pathogenic nucleic acid(s) determined."
10998417,"ABSTRACT:
Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) accumulation and misfolding is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's Disease
(PD) and related synucleinopathies. These disorders include multiple cellular dysfunctions including impaired
proteostasis (e.g., the dysregulation of the autophagy lysosomal pathway [ALP]). As preclinical disease models
become more complex to better recapitulate disease relevant pathophysiology— i.e., monoculture ➔ 2D co-
culture ➔ 3D organoids (both mono- and co-cultured) ➔ in vivo — advanced multiplexing technologies that are
capable of dynamic temporal and spatial monitoring of protein-protein interactions (e.g., aSyn oligomerization
and misfolding) and pathological phenotypes are required. Existing fluorescence-based biosensors are limited
by their static nature and inability to differentiate signals across distinct cell types within multi-cellular
environments. To address this, our proposal introduces Dark-FRET (DF) and Dual-Channel DF (DCDF) cellular
biosensors that utilize the Shadow-G/Y/R series of acceptor protein which were engineered as to have reduced
quantum yield and negligible fluorescence emission, eliminating emission spillover from acceptor proteins which
facilitates improved live-cell multiplexing for multiple protein-protein interaction (PPI) fluorescence assays.
This cutting-edge approach enables real-time monitoring of both aSyn folding (ShadowY-aSyn-mNeongreen)
and aggregation (aSyn-mScarlet-I3/ShadowR) FRET biosensors expressed in distinct cellular populations. We
expand on these capabilities by multiplexing the aSyn DCDF biosensors with our TFEB (the master regulator of
ALP), FRET and nuclear translocation biosensors. Aim 1 involves applying these biosensors to CNS-resident
cell lines (neurons, microglia, astrocytes) to establish mono-, bi-, and tri-culture cellular models for dynamically
tracking cell-specific aSyn interactions and ALP phenotype. Aim 2 extends DCDF technology to in vivo models
using novel C. elegans strains expressing aSyn DCDF and ALP biosensors in specific tissues. By enabling
simultaneous monitoring of aSyn oligomerization and phenotypic dysfunction, this approach provides a valuable
tool for investigating synucleinopathies. Its potential applications extend to 3D organoids and hiPSC models,
offering insights into diverse cell-type pathways and enabling the identification of compounds modulating aSyn
oligomerization and pathological phenotypes in these advanced preclinical models.
In summary, our DF/DCDF technology presents a groundbreaking approach, enabling dynamic monitoring of
aSyn aggregation and pathological phenotypes across complex disease models, paving the way to address
biological questions on the supporting roles of microglia and astrocytes on neuronal health and function.
Furthermore, these multiplexed biosensors represent an innovative preclinical therapeutic discovery platform
that holds promise for enhancing the drug discovery process, potentially filling the therapeutic gap in
synucleinopathy treatment."
10998413,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An estimated 14.8 million children – 90% of whom live in Africa – are HIV-exposed and uninfected (CHEU).
Despite advances in understanding health outcomes of CHEU, the neurodevelopmental impact of HIV exposure
has not been well characterized. Several small studies conducted in high income countries (HIC) suggest a
higher prevalence of autism in CHEU. CHEU may be at elevated risk for autism due to HIV exposures, which
are associated with adverse birth outcomes, iron-deficiency anemia, and maternal and child infectious morbidity.
These risks have been shown to be associated with autism outcome in HIC, but no study to date has examined
autism in CHEU in Africa where the vast majority of these children live. Investigating autism in CHEU has high
potential to identify mediating risks on the causal pathway between HIV exposure and autism outcome and
inform the selection of modifiable targets for precision detection and intervention strategies in low- and middle-
income countries (LMIC). However, there is a lack of neurodevelopmental expertise and tools to carry out
research in these settings. Scalable diagnostic and neurobehavioral tools for detection and study of mechanistic
neural processes are necessary to advance autism research in these settings. Eye tracking is a powerful, low-
cost, feasible neurobehavioral tool used in HIC for both autism detection and investigation of neurocognitive
processes. To achieve improved health outcomes in LMIC, a key research priority must include capacity building
in state-of-the science diagnostic and neurobehavioral methods for autism detection. The objective of this
proposal is to examine autism diagnostic outcome and eye-tracking markers in CHEU while building capacity for
neuro-health research in Kenya. We will accomplish this by leveraging a longitudinally assessed cohort of CHEU
and children who are HIV unexposed and uninfected (CHUU) with well characterized HIV-related and contextual
exposures (R01HD104552) and synergistically expanding our team’s ongoing neuro-health capacity building
efforts (R21MH127570). This work will be guided by a Community and Scientific Advisory Panel and situated
within the Academic Model Providing Access to Care (AMPATH) program. In Aim 1, we will compare autism
diagnostic outcomes between young CHEU and CHUU across a large cohort (N=850) of Kenyan children. In
Aim 2, we will determine whether neurobehavioral eye-tracking markers predict autism outcome in CHEU and
CHUU. Through a series of tiered training and mentorship activities integrated with the proposed research
activities of Aims 1 and 2, in Aim 3 we will build global scientific partnerships and upskill a Global Neuro-Health
Collaborative in Kenya with the clinical and research expertise, tools, and resources necessary to solve high
impact setting-specific health challenges. This study is innovative as it will be the first to apply rigorous diagnostic
and eye-tracking methodologies to investigate autism outcomes in CHEU in LMIC. The proposed work has high
potential to inform precision detection and intervention strategies to mitigate deleterious outcomes of both HIV
exposure and autism."
10998475,"Many pathological conditions associated with excessive bone loss are characterized by increased
generation of osteoclasts, myeloid lineage cells that resorb bone. The long term goals of this project are to
elucidate molecular pathways and mechanisms that regulate myeloid cell function and osteoclastogenesis
under pathological inflammatory conditions, with the associated goal of using this information to develop
new therapeutic approaches to suppress pathological bone resorption.
 Inflammation is an important driver of pathological bone loss in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis
and infections. Pathological inflammation-associated bone loss is resistant to standard anti-resorptive
therapies; thus, development of new treatments represents an important unmet medical need.
 In the previous cycle of this application, we defined epigenetic and metabolic mechanisms by which
inflammatory cytokines, interferon- (IFN-) and hypoxia regulate osteoclastogenesis. We tested the
pathophysiological importance of these mechanisms in models of inflammatory bone loss including arthritis,
implant loosening, supracalvareal osteolysis, and orthopedic periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). PJI is a
devastating complication of joint replacement surgery that is resistant to treatment and a major cause of
morbidity, and even mortality, in orthopedics. One aspect of PJI is biofilm-associated infection at the bone-
implant interface which results in boss loss and implant loosening.
 Using a clinically relevant tibial implant model of persistent biofilm-associated Staphylococcus
aureus PJI, we observed bone loss and failure of osseointegration. This was associated with sustained
inflammation at sites of infection, but adaptive immune T cells were suppressed. Advancing the literature
demonstrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that suppress T cells in S. aureus infections, we
newly identified expression of inhibitory genes in the setting of a strong IFN- signature, an osteoclastogenic
program selectively at the bone-implant interface, and altered myelopoiesis in the distal bone marrow.
Inhibitory gene expression was markedly higher in tissue adjacent to the implant and biofilm, relative to soft
tissues infected with planktonic phase S. aureus. Based on these results, our overarching hypothesis is that
S. aureus PJI infection induces sustained inflammation that drives osteoclastogenesis, but concomitantly
induces feedback inhibitory mechanisms that suppress adaptive immunity and attenuate clearance of
infection, resulting in substantial morbidity.
 We propose that greater understanding of the inflammatory and bone marrow responses that drive
osteoclastogenesis, and of feedback mechanisms that suppress the adaptive immune response to PJI, will
provide knowledge that can be used to develop new approaches to suppress pathologic bone resorption
and to develop adjuvant immunotherapies to help clear this devastating condition."
10978461,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged suddenly in 2012 as the cause of
severe respiratory illness in humans. Despite the high mortality rate (~ 40%) and the significant potential for a
public health emergency, there are no FDA-approved vaccines or antiviral drugs for MERS. Consequently, there
is an urgent and unmet need for the development of small-molecule drugs to control MERS-CoV infection.
Furthermore, members of the Merbecovirus and Sarbecovirus subgenera within the Betacoronavirus genus pose
a high risk of future spillover into humans. However, efforts to develop general strategies to mitigate the impact
of future pandemics have been limited. Coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a well-characterized
therapeutic target as it processes most cleavage sites on virus polyproteins and is essential for virus replication.
Multiple series of 3CLpro inhibitors with potent activity against MERS-CoV and in vivo efficacy in mouse models
were reported by our group. However, these compound series are parenterally administrable with limited oral
bioavailability. Hypothesize of this project is that inhibitors exploiting the exquisite stereochemical control and
multiple diversity sites afforded by the 1,3,2-oxazaphospholidin-3-one scaffold (series I and II) and decorated
with a novel transition state analog endowed with favorable oral bioavailability can serve as a launching pad for
the development of orally bioavailable MERS-CoV-specific antivirals. As these inhibitors can engage in binding
interactions with the Sn and Sn' pockets of various coronavirus 3CLpros, the scaffold provides a versatile platform
for merbecoviruses and sarbecoviruses. Aims of this project are 1) Conduct iterative structure-guided design,
synthesis, and multiparameter optimization of inhibitors for MERS-CoV; 2) Conduct biochemical, structural, and
virological studies to characterize and prioritize analogs for MERS-CoV 3CLpro and conduct structure-activity
relationship studies with the generated series for merbecovirus/sarbecovirus 3CLpros; and 3) Demonstrate in
vivo efficacy of optimized leads in a mouse model of MERS-CoV infection. The overarching goal of this project
is the identification of an orally bioavailable preclinical candidate and 1-2 backup compounds based on inhibitor
series (I and II) for MERS-CoV infection, and the exploration and utilization of the generated inhibitors against
the 3CLpros of merbecoviruses and sarbecoviruses."
10978430,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating toxicities/side effects stemming from cancer
and its treatments. Patients who endure hematologic malignancies are disproportionately affected. There are
few effective treatments for cancer-related fatigue in part because its underlying etiology and pathophysiology
are not well understood. However, disruption of circadian rhythm and dysregulation of glucose metabolism are
two related mechanisms that possibly underlie cancer-related fatigue. Time-restricted eating is a daily eating
pattern that entails consuming food within a defined, consistent window (e.g., 10 h) every day. When the eating
window aligns with the daylight hours, it strongly entrains circadian processes and modulates physiological
regulation of whole-body metabolism. It is hypothesized that time-restricted eating can relieve cancer-related
fatigue in blood cancer survivors via regulating circadian rhythm and improving metabolism. This project is a 12-
week, two-arm, phase II randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of time-restricted eating (10 h daytime
feeding/14 h fasting at night) vs. a control, unrestricted feeding arm on cancer-related fatigue; follow-up at 24
weeks is also planned. A total of 96 blood cancer survivors will be recruited; eligible survivors will be 2 months
to 2 years post-curative treatment, suffer from moderate to severe fatigue, consume food within a window that
is >10 h, and not be employed away from the home at night. They will be randomized 1:1, intervention: control.
All participants will meet with a nutritionist and discuss nutrition guidelines for cancer survivors; those in the
intervention group will self-select a 10-hour eating window in which to meet the guidelines. At baseline, 6 weeks,
and 12 weeks (post-intervention), we will assess patient-reported fatigue, measures of circadian activity rhythm
(via an activity tracker) and glucose metabolism via continuous glucose monitoring. Participants will log their
food intake using the myCircadianClock smartphone app at baseline and throughout the 12-week study. Aim 1
is to provide initial estimates of efficacy of the 12-week time-restricted eating intervention vs. an unrestricted
eating pattern on patient-reported fatigue. Aim 2 is to assess maintenance of the dietary pattern and sustainability
of any changes in fatigue at 24 weeks. Mechanistic aims assess the effects of time-restricted eating on circadian
rest-activity rhythm (mesor, amplitude, and acrophase) and glucose metabolism (fasting blood glucose, average
blood glucose, glucose excursions), specifically exploring: 1) the associations between changes in circadian
rhythms, glucose metabolism, and fatigue from baseline to post-intervention, and 2) the associations between
adherence to the intervention and changes in circadian rhythm, glucose metabolism, and fatigue. The time-
restricted eating intervention is scalable and inexpensive, lending itself to be accessible to most cancer survivors.
Data generated herein will be used to inform a larger, phase III multisite clinical trial testing the effects of time-
restricted eating on cancer-related fatigue among survivors of hematological malignancies, and further optimize
interventions that entrain circadian rhythm and improve glucose metabolism to alleviate cancer-related fatigue."

Proper synaptic connectivity between photoreceptors and their respective partners is essential for normal visual
transmission and processing. The inability of photoreceptors to form synaptic connections during development
underlies many vision-related neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, elucidating the developmental mechanisms
that mediate appropriate photoreceptor connectivity will provide insights into devising therapeutic approaches to
treat patients with retinal diseases. In the mammalian retina, the different types of photoreceptors synapse
selectively to distinct postsynaptic targets: horizontal cells and bipolar neurons. During development,
photoreceptors first make contacts to horizontal cells (referred to as first synaptic contact) and then to bipolar
neurons (i.e. second synaptic contact). Although the timing and patterns of connections have been well-
described for photoreceptors, little is known about the early molecular events that coordinate the selective wiring
of photoreceptors to their respective targets. In this proposal, we investigate a new role for the cytoskeletal
scaffolding proteins, Ankyrins in mediating the early developmental events involved in photoreceptor
connectivity. In my preliminary data, I found Ankyrin-B (AnkB) and Ankyrin-G (AnkG) to be differentially
expressed in both a spatial and temporal manner in the developing retina. AnkB is highly expressed in horizontal
cells at early time points when the first synaptic connection between photoreceptors and horizontal cells is being
established, whereas AnkG is expressed at later stages in bipolar neurons when the second synaptic connection
is formed. Moreover, my initial data reveals that loss of AnkB and AnkG results in phenotypes consistent with
synaptic connectivity defects between photoreceptors and their synaptic targets. Additionally, I also find that
there are impaired retinal responses in animals with disruption of AnkB and AnkG compared to controls.
Therefore, I hypothesize that Ankyrins are the key molecules that mediate selective wiring of
photoreceptors to their postsynaptic partners during development. To test my hypothesis, I will utilize
mouse transgenics, high-resolution imaging, and functional visual assays to identify the function of Ankyrins in
photoreceptor connectivity. Specifically, the proposed work will uncover the different roles of Ankyrins in the cone
and rod pathway (Aim 1), the developmental mechanism of when Ankyrins are required for synaptic connectivity
(Aim 2), and the cell-type specific requirements of Ankyrins in photoreceptor connectivity (Aim 3). By performing
the proposed experiments, we will elucidate a new role for Ankyrins in mediating synaptic connectivity in the
developing retina. This work will have broad significance as it may reveal new potential targets that can be used
to restore photoreceptor connections in patients suffering from vision loss."

Bacterial diseases constitute a major global burden, primarily due to respiratory, peritoneal, and blood infections.
Our lab and others have demonstrated that investigating host-derived innate immune responses may elucidate
pathways important for combating bacterial threats. Myeloid cells, such as tissue-resident alveolar macrophages,
serve as an essential first line of defense. Because phagocytosis of bacteria and subsequent microbial lysis in
the acidified phagolysosome are an integral part of their response, targets that regulate the phagolysosome are
of major physiological significance and could possibly lead to points of clinical intervention during infection.
Interestingly, chloride anion (Cl-) governs a range of biological functions, including intracellular vesicular
acidification and cell signaling. Over the past four years, a new Cl- channel, proton-activated chloride channel 1
(PACC1), has been discovered and structurally characterized. However, the main biological role of PACC1
remains poorly defined, and its relevance to bacterial immunity is entirely unknown. Our key conceptual
contribution to the nascent PACC1 biology field is that PACC1 may play a critical function in the highly acidic and
chloride-packed phagolysosome in myeloid cells. To explore this, we have generated PACC1-deficient (PACC1-
/-) mice, which our data suggest have defects in phagolysosomal acidification when challenged with bacteria.
Accordingly, this defect is associated with increased susceptibility to S. pneumoniae infection in the lung and E.
coli infection in the peritoneum and blood, compared to wildtype mice. Dysregulated hyperinflammation and
myeloid cell recruitment in PACC1-/- mice are unable to clear infection. In this proposal, we will test our hypothesis
that PACC1 provides protection by promoting myeloid cell responses during bacterial infection, particularly in
alveolar macrophages, by supporting phagolysosomal acidification and bacterial killing. Our innovative approach
will leverage multiple disease models (pneumonia and sepsis), novel mouse strains, and transcriptomics, to
uncover the role of PACC1. In Aim 1, we will test if global PACC1 loss in PACC1-/- mice impairs phagolysosomal
and effector functions in myeloid cells in vitro (Aim 1.1); and impair bacterial killing by myeloid cells in vitro and
by alveolar macrophages in vivo (Aim 1.2). In Aim 2, we will study the myeloid cell-specific role of PACC1 during
infection in vivo. We will infect novel myeloid cell conditional PACC1 knockout mice with S. pneumoniae to study
clinical severity and immunologic responses, and probe mechanisms using phagolysosomal proton pump
inhibitors and neutrophil-depleting antibodies (Aim 2.1). We will also test if PACC1 loss in alveolar macrophages
and neutrophils results in deleterious transcriptomic perturbations during pneumococcal pneumonia via RNA-
sequencing (Aim 2.2). Finally, we will test if novel myeloid cell conditional PACC1 overexpressing knockin mice
are resistant to pneumonia due to improved phagolysosomal bacterial clearance (Aim 2.3). Overall, our goal will
be to elucidate a beneficial role for PACC1 in myeloid cells during bacterial infection, while pursuing a rigorous
training platform for my development as an independent pulmonary immunology researcher."

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is caused by an antibody-mediated autoimmune response to muscle acetylcholine
receptors (AChRs) that impairs neuromuscular transmission. There is no cure for MG or therapy specifically
suppressing only the pathological autoimmune response to AChRs. We wish to develop an antigen-specific cell
therapy for MG by engineering regulatory T cells (Tregs) with AChR-specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs)
to specifically suppress autoreactive T/B cells. Pathological mechanisms impairing neuromuscular transmission
in MG and chronic experimental autoimmune MG (EAMG) are similar. The dysfunction of Tregs to suppress T
effector cells and the decrease of Treg population are found in both untreated MG patients and EAMG rats.
These suggest that rodent EAMG is a suitable model for evaluating the effectiveness of cell therapies. Adoptive
transfer of polyclonal expanded non-specific Tregs reduces EAMG in rats. We hypothesize that AChR-specific
CAR-engineered Tregs have greater efficacy and specificity than non-specific Tregs in suppressing the
pathological autoimmune response to AChRs in EAMG. To address this hypothesis, we will optimize the
transduction efficiency in rat T cells and characterize cellular phenotypes, cytokine profiles, and suppressive
function of CAR Tregs in vitro (Aim 1). We have constructed AChR-specific CARs from single chain variable
fragments derived from the parental anti-AChR rat hybridoma cell lines. Rat Tregs transduced with an AChR-
specific CAR were activated and expanded in vitro in response to antigen-specific stimulation and suppressed
T cell proliferation in response to polyclonal stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. We will enhance CAR
transduction in rat T cells by producing high-titer retroviral particles using packaging cell lines. Alternatively, we
will purify CAR-positive Tregs using the QBend-10 epitope incorporated into the CARs within the CD8 hinge. We
will try to increase the yield of CAR-Treg by converting rat conventional T cells into Tregs by enforcing the
expression of FoxP3. We will investigate transduced cells for cellular phenotypes, cytokine profiles, and in vitro
suppressive function in an antigen-specific manner. Aim 2 is to investigate the safety and efficacy of AChR-
specific CAR-transduced Tregs as a potential treatment for MG in EAMG rats. We have developed a novel
EAMG model in which the autoimmune response is driven by a feed-forward cycle of autoimmune stimulation to
endogenous AChRs released from damaged muscle in the autoimmune assault, allowing to investigate the
impact of our CAR-Treg therapy on the self-sustaining autoimmune response to AChRs. Using this novel model,
we will investigate prevention of EAMG by administering CAR-transduced Tregs immediately after the induction
of EAMG and treatment of ongoing EAMG by administering CAR-transduced Tregs after the onset of chronic
EAMG. The latter is the clinically relevant model for treating MG. We will investigate whether and how the epitope
specificities of the CARs influence the efficacy and safety profiles of the CAR-Tregs. This work will provide the
basis and rationale to investigate the mechanisms by which the CAR Tregs act and create CARs for human use."

SUMMARY.
Periodontitis is one of the most prevalent diseases and a leading cause of tooth loss. In the United States,
approximately 61 million adults over 30 years old have periodontitis (42.2%) with 7.8% having severe
periodontitis. A disproportionate host response and dysbiotic microbiota are the two major etiologic factors. The
standard treatment, mechanical debridement, to remove biofilm has limited clinical efficacy in patients with
dysregulated immune responses. There is a critical need for novel host modulation therapies with safe, localized,
and effective delivery characteristics to treat periodontitis. Recent advances in synthetic biology have presented
new opportunities to use genetically-engineered bacteria for disease treatment. In particular, our team has
developed genetic tools to program the commercial human probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) to
secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. Furthermore, we have increased the
viability and efficacy of these engineered L. reuteri by encapsulating them in biocompatible biomaterials. These
novel biotechnological approaches can be effective in treating periodontitis. The goal of this project is to develop
a biomaterial-enhanced system for targeted localization of engineered microbes releasing therapeutic
molecules, an “oral micro-drug factory”, effective for host modulation and tissue healing. Our objective is to locally
administer engineered L. reuteri secreting the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10 (IL-10), to evaluate the
phenotypic and molecular effects in experimental periodontitis models. The hypothesis is that localized and
sustained delivery of IL-10 from well-contained L. reuteri can reduce periodontal inflammation and promote
periodontal tissue healing. We will achieve our goals through two specific aims: (1) Validate the ability of
engineered L. reuteri producing IL-10 to treat experimental periodontitis; (2) Use a microneedle patch to localize
L. reuteri and enable boosted potency delivery of IL-10 to treat specific areas of experimental periodontitis. Well-
established methods will be used to analyze local and systemic immune responses and oral microbiota shifts in
these periodontitis-affected animals treated with this novel approach. The outcomes of this project will
demonstrate that localized host modulation through the biomaterial-based application of engineered L. reuteri
can treat experimental periodontitis. Encapsulation of bacteria in the stable and biocompatible microneedle patch
attached to the gingiva will improve their effectiveness without allowing L. reuteri to become the dominant oral
species. This will shed light on novel clinical applications of engineered microorganisms able to achieve
localized, sustained host modulation in treating periodontitis using a combinatorial strategy of biomaterials and
synthetic biology."

Mast cells (MCs) expand within the epithelium and sub-epithelium during prevalent and burdensome human
mucosal disease, including asthma, nasal polyposis, food allergy and eosinophilic esophagitis, where they are
thought to play a central role in disease pathobiology. MCs take on discrete protease expression profiles in
each location, with sup-epithelial MCs co-expressing tryptase and chymase (MCTC) while epithelial MCs
express tryptase alone (MCT). Although MCT preferentially expand during human type 2 mucosal inflammatory
disease, very little is known about how these cells influence tissue inflammation in part because all existing
systems for in vitro study of MCs give rise to MCTC. We have recently developed a novel cell culture system for
directing the selective in vitro differentiation of MCT or MCTC from human peripheral blood CD34+ cells,
allowing in-depth study of MCT effector function of phenotypes for the first time. This proposal seeks to use our
culture system to test the central hypothesis that MCTs within the epithelium have a discrete effector phenotype
and that a more comprehensive understanding of the effector function linked to this phenotype will enhance
our understanding of disease endotypes in nasal polyposis. A related hypothesis is that in vitro activation
profiles of MCTC poorly predict. In support of these hypotheses, preliminary findings indicate that in MCT and
MCTC have differential capacity to generate the pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and type 2 inflammation-linked
cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 following activation, mimicking transcriptional differences between the two phenotypes
in vivo, and that IL-4 differentially regulates upregulation of the high affinity IgE receptor FceR1a in each
population. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to comprehensively define production of cytokines, chemokines and
growth factors in vitro-derived MCT vs MCTC in response to a range of activating stimuli, as well as determine
the transcriptional changes associated with each. Aim 2 characterizes the differential effects of several
inflammation-associated mediators on MCT vs MCTC activation, based on differential expression of cell surface
receptors and signal transduction components between the two subsets. Aim 3 datasets generated through
aim 1 and 2 to probe existing scRNA-seq data and datasets generated by a collaborator assessing
eicosanoids in the nasal lavage of nasal polyposis patients at baseline and following a series of therapeutic
interventions, in an attempt to use our in vitro findings to better understand MC effector function in vivo.
Completion of these aims will greatly expand our understanding MC effector capacity differential effector
capacity of human MC subsets in human disease and is a critical first step towards a more comprehensive
understanding of the role of MCs in human disease pathobiology."

Sarcoidosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease of unknown cause. To better understand
disease mechanisms, we have recently established a novel ex vivo human granuloma model that shares many
structural and molecular features of the disease in human tissues, yielding novel insights into mechanisms
regulating early granuloma formation. In keeping with prior investigations and clinical experience linking
sarcoidosis to elevated levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) in sarcoidosis tissues, molecular
characterization of the sarcoidosis granuloma model indicates that macrophages participating in sarcoidosis
granuloma formation are regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Our strong
preliminary data shows that sarcoidosis macrophages produce aldosterone, a hormone that promotes
inflammation through the activation of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs); and we further show that inhibition of
MRs attenuates granuloma formation. We hypothesize that RAAS promotes pathological granuloma formation
and fibrosis in patients with sarcoidosis through activation of MRs and related production of reactive oxidant
species (ROS). In the spirit of the R21 funding mechanisms, this project is highly innovative and has important
beneficial implications for advancing our understanding of sarcoidosis disease mechanisms and for providing
novel therapeutic targets and disease biomarkers. Aim 1 will determine if RAAS/MR activation promotes
sarcoidosis granuloma formation through redox signaling to promote NRF2/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)
pathway activation. We posit that MR activation promotes mitochondrial ROS production to trigger
NRF2/HO-1 signaling resulting in alternative macrophage (M2) polarization favoring granuloma formation. Aim
2 will determine if RAAS/MR activation promotes collagen and pro-fibrotic molecule formation by
sarcoidosis granulomas through induction of TGFβ and inflammasome signaling. These studies will
determine if sustained MR activation (by RAAS) promotes pro-fibrotic induction through pathways independent
from NRF2/HO-1; dependent on direct ROS-dependent activation of TGFβ and induction of inflammasome
mediated IL-33 release. The short-term goals of this project are to advance basic understanding of sarcoidosis
disease mechanisms regulating distinct disease manifestations of (1) granuloma formation induced by MR
induced ROS production and downstream pathways regulating granuloma formation (NRF2/HO-1) and (2)
tissue fibrosis relating to TGFβ and inflammasome/IL-33 regulated pro-fibrotic responses. Long-term
aspirations of this project are to address current deficiencies in the field of sarcoidosis as relates to
identifying novel disease-specific therapies targeting granuloma formation and tissue fibrosis, including
repurposing of safe, widely available RAAS modulating drugs (e.g., ACE and MR inhibitors) or antioxidants,
and emerging therapies targeting NRF2, HO-1 and IL-33."
10998506,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder in which the complex and interacting
influences of genetics and environment drive neuropathological processes leading to symptom development.
While the precise neuropathological underpinnings of SZ remain undetermined, and multiple brain regions are
likely to be involved, both genetic and neuropathological evidence suggest that disrupted glutamatergic
synaptic function in the cerebral cortex can be an important component of symptom development in SZ.
Studies, including from the contact PI Stewart Anderson’s, lab have also suggested that mitochondrial
weakness may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. Since a major locus, perhaps the major locus,
of mitochondrial ATP dependence for neural function occurs in the presynaptic terminal, it stands to reason that
mitochondrial weakness could be one influencer of the glutamatergic synaptic disruption contributing to SZ.
 The most common genetic risk factor for SZ is the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), occurring in about
1:3000 births, roughly one quarter of which develop SZ. We previously used IPSC-derived glutamatergic
neurons (iNeurons) and lymphoblastoid cell lines to demonstrate that while the condition of 22q+SZ is
associated with weaker ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), 22qDS without SZ
(22q(-)SZ) is associated with elevated levels of mitochondrial-biogenesis related transcripts that may denote a
compensatory mechanism reducing SZ risk. Treatment of iNeurons from the 22q+SZ group with the medication
bezafibrate resulted in enhanced expression of mitochondria biogenesis-related genes as well as normalization
of their ATP production. Here we propose to extend these studies with the following aims:
Aim 1: Study of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy in IPSC-derived neurons from 22qDS with or without
SZ and unaffected controls. We hypothesize that there will be enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover
in the 22q(-)SZ group relative to both controls and 22q+SZ.
Aim 2: Study of glutamatergic synaptic release in IPSC-derived neurons from 22qDS with or without SZ and
unaffected controls. We hypothesize that OXPHOS deficits in IPSC-derived neurons from 22qDS+SZ will result
in reduced glutamatergic synaptic release and reduced synaptic vesicle cycling relative to neurons from 22qDS
without schizophrenia and to healthy controls, and that activation of mitochondrial biogenesis with bezafibrate
will normalize synaptic vesicle cycling and glutamate release in the 22qDS+SZ group.
Success in showing that 22q(-)SZ is associated with enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis/turnover would bolster
the rationale for targeting this system to prevent or ameliorate SZ symptoms in 22qDS. Since synaptic energetic
weakness, potentially interacting with genetic and environmental factors that also affect synaptic function, has
been implicated in non-syndromic SZ and other neuropsychiatric disorders, the novel human-based experimental
paradigms we apply in this proposal could be broadly applicable to other IPSC-based studies of brain disease."
10998620,"SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 This proposal aims to reveal critical neural mechanisms for intelligent reward-driven learning and
decision-making. It is well established that animals, including humans, use internal models of the world to
guide their behavior. Model-based computations are especially vital in complex environments, where animals
often need to plan a sequence of choices leading to later rewards. Furthermore, after receiving a reward
animals update their reward predictions (“values”) – both for earlier choices they made, and for alternative
ways of reaching that reward. These adaptive behaviors rely on combining simulations (of potential paths) with
evaluations (of whether they are worthwhile).
 The hippocampus is believed to play a critical role in model-based decision-making, because it can
generate coherent “non-local” representations of distant places. These take at least two distinct forms. First, as
rats run through an environment hippocampal place cells generally represent current location, but during late
phases of the theta rhythm this place code can sweep forward to potential future locations. It was previously
found that these “theta sequences” can rapidly flicker between available choices, on alternating theta cycles –
highly suggestive of a role in evaluating options. Second, during immobility the hippocampus can produce
sharp-wave-ripple (SWR) events, that often encode highly-compressed sequences of places. These occur
much more often shortly after rats receive rewards – highly suggestive of a role in updating values. However,
whether hippocampal non-local activity patterns are actually used for these purposes is unknown, largely
because whether they access values is unknown. There is intriguing evidence that SWRs evoke activity
changes in the network of brain areas vital for value-guided decisions (including frontal cortex and ventral
striatum). But whether hippocampal non-local activity is actually associated with value retrieval (during theta
sequences) and/or value updating (during SWRs) is unknown.
 This proposal would rigorously assess the relationships between value-guided decision-making and
hippocampal non-local representations. We will employ advanced recording techniques and an innovative
foraging task, complemented by sophisticated decoding algorithms and precisely-timed manipulations. We will
test two specific hypotheses: that post-reward SWRs are used to update values of distant locations (Aim 1),
and that theta sequences are used for online, value-guided decisions (Aim 2). These Aims engage the full
combined expertise of our team of experimentalists and theoreticians, including large-scale recordings across
multiple regions, statistical methods to identify non-local representations, and reinforcement learning
algorithms to estimate decision variables from behavior. These studies have the potential to transform our
understanding of how our brains explore internal models to guide learning and decision-making."

Metastases to the central nervous system (CNS) are a common complication of breast cancer. Prognosis is
typically on the order of a few months. Immunotherapies have revolutionized the management of many types of
cancers. However, these agents have not been systematically studied in the management of CNS metastases
from breast cancer. We are conducting several Phase II trials to explore the role of newly developed
immunotherapies in CNS metastases. Three of our trials have already met primary endpoint, with a subset of
patients with breast cancer showing responses to immunotherapy. We propose to study cancer genetic and
immune phenotypic changes in samples collected from patients before, during and after immunotherapy. Our
overarching objective is to characterize mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy in CNS metastases. To
achieve this, we will chart the co-evolution of cancer and the immune system over time and anatomical location
during immunotherapy by profiling DNA and RNA from cancer tissues, peripheral blood, and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF). Notably, using cutting edge single-cell technologies, we will examine alterations to the cancer genome
and immune cell behaviors at unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, in our innovative mouse models of brain
metastases, we will study novel combination therapies, including CDK inhibition with immune-checkpoint
blockade, to augment the efficacy of immunotherapy. We believe that this work has the potential to uncover basic
mechanisms of treatment-failure in these patients and that these discoveries will have tremendous translational
potential as a basis on which to refine existing immunotherapy protocols and develop novel treatment strategies."
10980400,"Invasive aspergillosis due to Aspergillus fumigatus is a leading infectious cause of death in immunocompromised
patients. The mortality rate is a staggering 40-60%, worsened by emerging resistance to azole antifungals.
Despite this, there is a significant knowledge gap surrounding the effectors governing A. fumigatus antifungal
response and resistance. We established calcineurin (CN) as a critical phosphatase required for A. fumigatus
growth, invasive disease, antifungal response and resistance. However, how CN regulates these processes is
largely undefined. We demonstrated CN-dependent transcriptional control over antifungal response via its
transcription factor, CrzA. Our CN proteomic and phosphoproteomic approaches uncovered several cell wall and
membrane-related proteins as potential CN effectors. We also defined unique changes in the CN proteome in
response to azole and echinocandin antifungals, and detected CN-dependent alterations in cell wall β-glucan
and membrane ergosterol and lipid profiles. We were also the first to crystallize the fungal CN complex, and our
structure-guided inhibitor strategies showed targeting CN is effective in animal models. Our objective is to
leverage our novel genetic, proteomic and lipidomic data to define CN control over antifungal response and
resistance. Our central hypothesis is that CN orchestrates parallel transcriptional and phosphoregulatory control
of key effectors in cell wall and membrane organization, thereby specifically governing antifungal response and
drug resistance. In Aim 1, we will identify key CN effectors for cell wall and membrane integrity and antifungal
response by bimolecular fluorescence complementation and affinity assays. CN effector localization studies in
CN inhibited/deletion backgrounds will confirm CN-dependency in response to antifungals. Molecular modeling
of CN-effector binding and molecular dynamics simulations will guide targeted mutations of predicted CN-binding
motifs in effectors. These integrated approaches will elucidate the unknown role played by CN in antifungal
response through binding and regulation of key effectors in cell wall and membrane synthesis. In Aim 2, we will
interrogate CN transcriptional control of effectors by examining expression in the background of CN and CN-
dependent transcription factor inhibition/deletions, including mutations in promoter CDRE sequences. We will
perform LC-MS/MS of phosphorylation sites in CN effectors in wild-type vs. CN-inhibited strains under antifungal
stress. Phosphomutations in CN effectors will assess the requirement of CN-dependent dephosphorylation at
specific residues for function in cell wall and membrane stress responses. In Aim 3, we will genetically
characterize contributions of prioritized CN effectors to resistance in azole- and echinocandin-resistant strains
using an iterative approach of genetic deletion, targeted mutations, and murine model validation. We will also be
the first to examine the emerging azole-resistant A. calidoustus species genetically and in animal models to fully
define CN effectors’ specific roles in drug response and disease. This study will, for the first time, define the
mechanism of CN control over antifungal response and resistance through cell wall and membrane effectors."
10980403,"While there is strong evidence supporting the role of the anterior cingulate cortex, basolateral amygdala, and
the hippocampus (ACC, BLA, HIPP) as a key neural network regulating mood, and therefore central to the
pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD), much remains unknown, including which gene pathways
and which specific cell types play a primary causal role mediating alterations in this circuit, and what cell-type
connections, within and between these regions, are particularly altered in depressive states. The overall
objective of this application is to generate single-cell transcriptomic profiles to study molecular changes,
including those specific to genetic ancestry and sex, associated with MDD in the mood regulation circuit. While
disease burden is greater in African Americans, the impact of genetic ancestry remains unknown as most
genomic studies in MDD so far have been limited to subjects of European descent. In addition, previous
studies revealed that transcriptomic changes associated with MDD are sex-specific, and gene networks are
differentially dysregulated between sexes. The applicants’ recent single-cell brain study revealed cell-specific
contributions to transcriptomic changes associated with MDD. The proposed project is a large-scale,
systematic investigation in the ACC, BLA, and HIPP to interrogate the transcriptome at single-nucleus
resolution in an unprecedently large and representative sample of MDD. The specific aims are to: 1) Identify, at
the single-cell level transcriptomic changes associated with MDD in 800 subjects across three linked brain
regions: ACC, BLA, and HIPP; 1b) Study the impact of genetic ancestry and sex; 2) Define cell networks
associated with mood regulation using machine learning approaches; and 3) Identify cell-specific expression
Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs) colocalizing with genome-wide significant SNPs identified in MDD GWAS
analyses. A large cohort (N=800) of human post-mortem samples obtained from subjects with MDD will be
compared to psychiatrically-healthy controls. The sample (~20% African American and ~30% female) will allow
for studying the impact of genetic ancestry and sex. Droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing will be
applied to generate transcriptomic profiles. Deep learning approaches will be used to identify and annotate the
cell types and gene networks associated MDD. The latest GWAS data in MDD will be leveraged to fine map
genetic loci with cellular and regional resolution. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first
large-scale investigation of the ACC-BLA-HIPP circuit in humans and will represent the largest single-cell
transcriptional resource of the human brain. It will identify gene and cellular networks associated with sex or
genetic ancestry, and will also generate a vast amount of transcriptomic data on neurotypical brains. This
research is significant because it will greatly advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular pathways
involved in mood regulation and MDD. Through a better understanding of the mechanisms of depressive
illness, we may be one step closer to developing novel treatment strategies and personalize interventions."
10983285,"Background: Rates of sexually transmitted infection (STI), especially gonorrhea and chlamydia, have
increased dramatically over the past decade. Several factors put women Veterans at higher risk for STIs
compared with both non-Veteran women and male Veterans, including substantial rates of exposure to sexual
violence (including military sexual trauma), intimate partner violence, and unsafe behavior associated with
posttraumatic stress and related substance use. Women are also more vulnerable to STI effects, as infection
may be asymptomatic, undetected, and lead to complications. Guideline-recommended STI screening can
detect infection and mitigate negative outcomes, but screening is underutilized.
Significance/Impact: Women’s health and primary care are priority areas identified by VA/ORD, and the VA
Directive 1330.01 states that facilities are required to provide STI screening and counseling in VA women’s
health and primary care clinics. However, screening protocols across VA are not well-implemented and
screening rates are suboptimal. To improve screening and outcomes, it is necessary to understand the current
landscape of STI screening in VA.
Innovation: The study is topically innovative because it focuses on a very prevalent but understudied issue
that plays a critical role in women’s functioning and well-being. Few studies have examined the epidemiology
of STIs in women Veterans and none has assessed health system responses to STIs or examined patterns in
rates of STI screening among women Veterans across patient, provider or practice characteristics. Further,
there is currently very little structural or informational support for providers screening for STIs.
Specific Aims: Use administrative data to examine practice-, provider-, and patient-level correlates of
gonorrhea and chlamydia screening in VA (Aim 1); use qualitative interviews to explore practice-, provider-,
and patient-level barriers and facilitators to STI screening in VA women’s health and primary care clinics (Aim
2); and use principles of user-centered design to develop a multi-pronged clinical decision support tool to
improve gonorrhea and chlamydia screening for women Veterans in women’s health and primary care and pilot
test it at VA facilities to assess uptake, usability, and reach (Aim 3).
Methodology: With a mixed-methods approach in Aims 1 & 2, employing quantitative electronic health record
analyses and subsequent qualitative interviews, this proposed CDA will examine correlates of screening and
explore barriers and facilitators to STI screening among women Veterans from both a patient and provider
perspective. These findings will inform Aim 3, the development of a clinical decision support tool employing
user-centered design, a participatory approach that incorporates multiple rounds of stakeholder feedback. The
clinical decision support tool will alert providers to gonorrhea and chlamydia screening needs, support sexual
history-taking and documentation, and raise awareness of screening guidelines to enhance STI management
for women patients across VA. The final tool will be tested in a small feasibility pilot at two VISN 4 facilities to
assess uptake, usability, and reach.
Next Steps/ Implementation: Findings from this study will be augmented by an HSR&D investigator-initiated
research (IIR) proposal in Year 3 to examine women Veteran’s use of non-VA care for GC/CT and inform an
IIR proposal in Year 5 for an effectiveness-implementation trial to test the decision support tool at multiple VA
sites."

the cell wall, the translocation of DNA across the cell membrane, and steps during the
recombination of this DNA with the recipient genome. Our studies will provide broad insights into
molecular details of transformation and will bring us closer to the long-term goal of understanding
the mechanism of DNA uptake. Using single molecule and bulk biochemical methods, it is

The short average service life and the rising incidence of secondary caries currently hamper the reliability of

restorations composed of novel resin networks, multifunctional fillers and additives, and adhesive constituents.
Our goal is to create superior resins and resin composites for dental restorations. These new restorations will
surpass the capabilities of the extant methacrylate, ester-based analogs. Our strategy centers on formulating
and testing novel resins and resin composites that resist hydrolysis and enzymolysis and possess antimicrobial,
protein-repellent, and therapeutic attributes, consequently producing dental adhesives and resin composites with
performance and a lifespan exceeding their methacrylate-based equivalents currently being used in dental clinics.
We will achieve our goal in three Specific Aims. Aim 1: We will develop and evaluate biostable hybrid resin
networks that may withhold the harsh challenges in patients’ oral environments. By strategically alternating the
packing of the methacrylate units with hydrophobic styrene-derivative units, we will protect ester-groups from
hydrolysis, enzymolysis, and cariogenic bacteria attack. The novel biostable hybrid resin networks will
encompass an acidic component for self-etch dental adhesives and multifunctional components for various
needs in dental restorations. We'll then employ a highly sensitive method to quantitively assess and rank these
hybrid resins against traditional ester-based resins. Aim 2: We plan to formulate and develop new multifunctional
hybrid resins and resin composites. These materials should match or be better than their ester-based
counterparts regarding antimicrobial, protein-repellent, and therapeutic aspects. We hypothesize that these
hybrid resin networks can seamlessly integrate with the functional additives and fillers previously devised for
conventional ester-based dental resin networks. Aim 3: We will subject the newly developed resins and
composites to rigorous testing as restorations (combinations of dental adhesives and resin composites) on
extracted human teeth under static and cyclic loadings. We will confirm their long-term performance in the most
clinically relevant scenarios by simulating real-world challenges such as clinical aging, thermal cycling, and
cariogenic biofilm exposure. Successful completion of the proposed Aims will result in the production of
multifunctional, durable dental resin restorations adept at addressing various needs for treating dental cavities."
10979285,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the world’s fastest-growing population and SSA-US
migration is growing rapidly, contributing to greater demographic heterogeneity and aging of US immigrants. Our
knowledge of SSA immigrants’ health comes primarily from analyses of US-based cross-sectional surveys that
often combine Black SSA immigrants with those from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and compares
them with US-born Blacks. SSA immigrants’ physical health tends to be better than US-born Blacks, positing
selective in- and out-migration, lifestyle, health behaviors, family and support networks, and cultural and racial
contexts of origins. However, immigrants’ mental health, especially depression, tends to be worse than for native-
born with evidence that greater exposure to US environments undermines immigrants’ health, particularly for
racialized minorities. Current US data, however, are limited for understanding the countervailing forces promoting
and undermining SSA immigrant health over time. We need data that: provide information on migrants’ pre-
migration sensitive life-stage exposures and origin households (HHs); allow comparisons among migrants, return
migrants and non-migrants at origin; map migrants’ social contacts at destination with kin and non-kin; measure
post-migration exposure to discrimination and acculturative stress; and follow SSA immigrants and similar non-
migrant Ghanaians over time to see how incorporation processes shape health behaviors and outcomes. This
project, with the short title of Ghanaian Migrant Health Study (GMHeS), proposes to collect and analyze such
data for the case of Ghana where the research team has strong partnerships and prior and ongoing formative
studies. The project will:(1) recruit linked binational samples of Ghanaians in Ghana and of Ghanaian immigrants
in the US using multiple sample recruitment approaches (conventional probability and link-tracing sampling
designs) and data sources (census, survey and administrative); (2) follow migrants over time; (3) use these
unique multi-sited data to analyze the physical and mental health of Ghanaian immigrants in the U.S, how their
health compares with health of native-born Blacks in the U.S., and comparable Ghanaians at origin, and (4)
improve the understanding of the roles of sensitive life-stage exposures pre- and post-migration, social networks,
acculturation and selection in predicting their health outcomes in the US. This innovative project promises
considerable gains in understanding of migration and health among the rapidly growing Ghanaian immigrant
population in the US, with important implications for the development of new approaches to study rigorously
other immigrant populations in the US and their contributions to life-course health and aging."

Neural circuits in sensory cortices are plastic, i.e., their properties change as new environmental information is
integrated based on its behavioral value. The capacity of acoustic stimuli alone to induce plasticity in the auditory
cortex (ACx) abruptly declines with age. In adults, ACx plasticity is induced during attentive wakefulness or by
pairing acoustic stimuli with the activation of neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis
or dopaminergic ventral tegmental area. It can also be induced in adults by passive exposure to acoustic stimuli
during experimental juvenile-like weakening of adenosine signaling in glutamatergic thalamocortical inputs to the
ACx. How the neuromodulatory systems interact with adenosine to refine cortical circuits is unclear. Recently,
we identified an event we have termed “sound-evoked adenosine release” (SEAR) in the ACx of awake adult
mice as a key gatekeeper for auditory cortical plasticity and improvement in auditory frequency-discrimination
acuity (perceptual plasticity). SEAR originates from the thalamocortical projections via ecto-5ʹ-nucleotidase
activity and becomes transiently reduced when acoustic stimuli are tightly paired with the activation of cholinergic
or dopaminergic circuits. These seconds-long low-adenosine conditions permit stimulus-specific associative
cortical and perceptual plasticities to occur. We, therefore, hypothesize that transient low-adenosine periods
triggered by activity in neuromodulatory circuits are prerequisites for sensory stimuli to produce behaviorally
significant cortical plasticity in adults. In this proposal, we aim to elucidate the developmental and spatiotemporal
characteristics of SEAR in the ACx by using fast-scanning cyclic voltammetry, which directly detects extracellular
adenosine with sub-second temporal resolution and 2-photon imaging of the ACx using the genetically encoded
fluorescent adenosine sensor GRABAdo. We also propose to test if the SEAR decrease driven by
neuromodulatory activity affects cortical plasticity of inhibitory neurons in the ACx. These experiments are
inspired by the notion that sensory and neuromodulatory conversion occurs at the level of the excitatory/inhibitory
balance, as the neuromodulators act through disinhibition of local inhibitory microcircuits to enhance the
excitability of the cortical excitatory neurons. Lastly, we propose to elucidate the mechanisms of SEAR decrease,
which depend on neuromodulatory activity. Specifically, we will determine whether equilibrative nucleoside
transporters in astroglia and thalamic adenosine production regulate the level of extracellular adenosine during
neuromodulatory activities. Together, these experiments will enable us to characterize in detail the mechanisms
of SEAR as a key gatekeeper of cortical and perceptual plasticities in adults."
10979589,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac fibrosis contributes to the progression of heart failure. Currently, there is no FDA-approved drug
specifically targeting cardiac fibrosis due to the lack of understanding of the underlying mechanism and a
reliable drug discovery platform. Here, we will use a novel multiplexing methodology of creating a ""cell village""
by pooling multiple patients' induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines in a dish to map the genetic basis of
interindividual differences in response to a profibrotic cocktail. In Aim 1, we will co-culture 100 iPSC lines
from 60 healthy donors and 40 dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients in 10 distinct ""cell villages,"" where
each ""cell village"" contains ten independent patient-specific iPSC lines. Next, we will differentiate each ""cell
village"" into iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs), endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs), and cardiac fibroblasts
(iPSC-CFs), and then generate 3D engineered heart tissues (EHTs). Finally, we will perform a single-cell
multiomics sequencing analysis of the ""cell villages"" to understand the impact of internal genetic
predisposition and external profibrotic stimuli on EHTs. In Aim 2, we will perform high throughput screening
to identify novel small molecules for treating cardiac fibrosis using novel iPSC-CF reporter lines. The
antifibrotic effects of the drug hits will be validated in primary CFs and EHTs. We will perform RNA- and ATAC-
sequencing to determine the downstream signaling pathways of the newly identified compounds. In Aim 3,
we will validate the therapeutic effects of antifibrotic compounds in mice models of dilated cardiomyopathy.
The cardiac function will be measured by echocardiography, and fibrosis severity will be assessed by
histology at multiple time points. We will also perform single-nuclei multiome and spatial transcriptomics to
delineate the impact of therapeutic drug treatment in each cell type cluster and cell-cell interactions in the
heart based on the 10x Genomics platform. Collectively, we expect to identify new signaling pathways and novel
compounds for patients with cardiac fibrosis and heart failure."

Development of an Intra-body wireless sensor link for COSMIIC NNP
This supplement will develop new capabilities for the COSMIIC System. Two modules under
current development are the “WING” and Sensor Withdrawn from A Remote Module
(SWARM). These will allow for real-time feedback of physiologic data to facilitate control for
closed-loop nerve stimulation algorithms. The WING module is intended to connect to wireless
devices and sensors outside the body, and the SWARM is designed for connection to tethered
sensors like inertial measurement units (IMUs) inside the body. Neither module, however,
supports data communication from untethered sensors within the body. With this supplement,
we propose to develop an intra-body wireless link that interfaces with the SWARM to enable
untethered, remote sensors to connect to the COSMIIC system. This will allow the COSMIIC
system to receive physiological feedback from sensors which cannot be safely accessed using
wires, or from sensors that only reside in the body for limited periods."
10998796,"ABSTRACT SUMMARY
Lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary incontinence and overactive bladder are very common in non-
neurogenic patients, with rates of around 10% in men and 20% in women, affecting millions of people worldwide
and leading to significant healthcare costs and impact. Current neurostimulators for continuous modulation of
bladder function apply neurostimulation to a sacral nerve or pudendal nerve with a multi-contact probe that is
placed along or adjacent to the target nerve. This location does not allow for intentional selectivity of any part of
the nerve. There are no FDA-approved clinical neuromodulation approaches targeting the pudendal nerve, which
has been studied extensively in pre-clinical models for on-demand control over bladder excitation and relaxation.
We believe that selective stimulation of the pudendal nerve may allow for user-initiated or closed-loop control
over both continence and micturition in a more efficient manner than the current non-specific neuromodulation
approach. In this proposal we will obtain the first demonstration of repeated selective pudendal nerve stimulation
in an awake, large animal model. To perform these studies, it is critical that we can use human-relevant
stimulation modules that allow for individual control over electrode channels, which the COSMIIC power and
stimulation modules will provide."

The success of PD-1-targeted immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment,
becoming a new standard of care for various types of cancer. However, the treatment outcomes for triple
negative breast cancer are still limited. To enhance the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, it is important to
gain a deeper understanding of PD-1 regulation in the tumor microenvironment.
B cells in the tumor immune microenvironment have been understudied, despite their growing recognition as key
players in shaping the tumor microenvironment. The presence of tumor-infiltrated B cells indicates the prognosis
of many types of cancer. Interestingly, our previous research in pre-clinical models has shown that the sensitivity
to dual ICI therapy, including the PD-1-targeted treatment, is dependent on B cells, and to a lesser extent, CD8+
T cells. These findings emphasize the importance of studying the PD-1 signaling in B cells to improve the clinical
outcomes of checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
The goal of this study is to understand how PD-1 signaling pathway regulates B cells in the tumor
microenvironment. One of the main mechanisms for PD-1 to modulate T cell function is through reprogramming
T cell metabolism, allowing them to meet the energy requirements needed for differentiation into various
subpopulations. We hypothesize that the PD-1 activation on tumor-infiltrated B cells alters the metabolic program
and B cell fate decision similar to T cells. PD-1-targeted therapy potentially impacts B cells in proliferation,
survival, differentiation, and function through metabolic reprogramming, which serve as a main mechanism for
PD-1 to regulate the antitumor function of B cells. Aim 1. To evaluate our hypothesis, we will dissect how PD-
1-targeted therapy modulates B cell differentiation through metabolic switch ex vivo. We will combine primary
murine B cell culture with state-of-the-art metabolic profiling tools to determine if and how PD-1 blockage directly
altered B cell differentiation and metabolism. This approach allows the evaluation of the glycolysis and fatty acid
metabolic machinery in B cell to control these cells differentiation into germinal center B cells, antibody-secreting
cells, and other functional subsets of B cells. Aim 2. We will use PD-1 fate mapping mice (PD-
1Cre/tdTomato.Rosa26floxp-YFP) and transgenic breast cancer models to examine how PD-1-blockage guides B cell
fate decisions and function in vivo. Elucidating the interaction between B cells and the PD-1 signaling pathway,
which has so far escaped the attention of the cancer immunology field, would strongly enhance the clinical
activity of ICI therapy in tumors where B cells are critical to the anti-tumor response."
10992464,"Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been associated with adverse cardiometabolic
health across the lifespan. Due to their widespread use in consumer and industrial products, the developing
fetus, infant, and child may be exposed via transplacental transfer, breast milk, dust ingestion, diet, and drinking
water. The long biological half-lives of some PFAS, which can range from 2-7 years in humans, intensifies
concerns about the risk of continued exposure and associated health effects. While elevated exposure to PFAS
in utero and during childhood may predispose exposed children to increased adiposity, systolic blood pressure,
and cholesterol levels, the biological mechanisms underlying the PFAS-cardiometabolic risk associations are not
well-understood. Growing evidence suggests that one mechanism by which PFAS may contribute to
cardiometabolic risk is through changes in DNA methylation (DNAm). As such, DNAm-derived epigenetic clocks
have emerged as a promising biomarker of aging and disease. Recent studies suggest gestational and childhood
exposure to environmental pollutants including phthalates, indoor air pollutants, and smoking influence the rate
of epigenetic aging. However, the link between PFAS, epigenetic aging, and cardiometabolic health in children
remains unknown. We will leverage data from the HOME Study, a prospective cohort of pregnant women and
their children from Cincinnati, OH, to calculate novel epigenetic biomarkers of aging and disease. The HOME
Study has repeated measures of serum PFAS concentrations across childhood, comprehensive assessments of
cardiometabolic markers in early adolescence, and DNA methylation at birth and 12 years of age. This will allow
us to: 1) determine if gestational and childhood PFAS are associated with epigenetic age acceleration (EGAA)
at birth and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in early adolescence; 2) determine if EGAA and EAA are
associated with increased cardiometabolic risk in early adolescence using multiple markers of cardiometabolic
health; and 3) explore the mediating role of EGAA in the association between gestational PFAS exposure and
cardiometabolic risk in early adolescence. By using these novel epigenetic clocks and quantifying the persistence
of these effects into adolescence, we will gain valuable insights into the impact of PFAS toxicity on biological
processes that may affect early life development and subsequent PFAS-associated cardiometabolic risk. This
diversity supplement will train a promising graduate student to enhance her training in environmental
epidemiology and biostatistical methods, and learn how to estimate and interpret biological aging measures
derived from high dimensional DNA methylation data."

Schizophrenia (Sz) is associated with deficits in reading ability that interrelate with disturbances in early
auditory and visual/oculomotor processing. This project evaluates consequences and causes of reading
impairment in Sz using combined multimodal imaging, eye tracking and computational modeling. Skilled
reading depends upon intact auditory and visual sensory integration, as well as higher-order cognition. Deficits
in early auditory processing in Sz are indexed by impaired tone matching and auditory plasticity, as well as by
impaired generation of mismatch negativity (MMN) and reflect dysfunction within subcortical and cortical
components of the early auditory system. Deficits in visual sensory processing are indexed by reduced
contrast and motion sensitivity, impaired generation of visual event-related potentials (ERP), reduced fMRI
activation of subcortical and cortical early visual regions. Visual oculomotor deficits are reflected by increased
rates of refixation in Sz, as well as impaired generation of the fixation-related potential (FRP) during reading.
Processes underlying impaired oculomotor control during reading may be modeled using non-linear
computational approaches, such as E-Z Reader, which evaluate effects of alterations in specific visual, lexical
and oculomotor parameters on discrete eye movement measures across populations and individuals. The
funded project evaluates reading performance in first-episode Sz participants to evaluate the relationship to
function outcome. This supplement extends the project in two ways. First, it adds reading assessments
(n=10/yr) to individuals already participating in cognitive remediation projects funded through NYS OMH clinics
in order to evaluate the effectiveness of current remediation approaches. Second, it implements a visually
targeted on-line remediation program that will be added to the funded project. Participants (n=10/yr) will then
undergo repeat eye-tracking and FRP assessment following 30 hrs of on-line intervention. These studies will
provide pilot data for future randomized, controlled clinical trials."
10992494,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the past eight years, my lab has pioneered studies of the acoustic communication system of Drosophila,
to address fundamental questions related to the neural mechanisms underlying sensory perception and the
generation of behaviors. Similar to other animals, flies produce and process patterned sounds during their
mating ritual. Using a combination of novel behavioral assays, neural circuit perturbations, neural recordings,
and computational modeling, we discovered that male song structure and intensity are continually sculpted by
interactions with the female, over timescales ranging from tens of milliseconds to minutes. Building on this
finding, we have gone on to dissect the neural mechanisms underlying the visual modulation of song patterning
in males. Using a similar set of tools, we have also interrogated the female side of acoustic communication,
and have successfully related song representations along the auditory pathway to changes in locomotor
behavior, again across multiple timescales. My lab has developed several new methods to facilitate these
studies, including methods for tracking and segmenting animal behavior, for population neural imaging, and for
single-cell transcriptomics in the Drosophila brain. Our system and discoveries lay the essential foundation for
now solving the bigger challenge of how an animal’s internal state and experiences contribute to shaping these
neural mechanisms. To do so, we will employ new computational models to identify the neural correlates of
internal state. We will also use a new paradigm to induce learning during acoustic communication, and will
characterize how learning shapes sensorimotor integration in this system. Finally, we will manipulate the
hunger or arousal status of flies to determine, again at the cellular level, how long timescale modulation of
neural activity shapes fast timescale sensorimotor processes. These new research directions will leverage the
methods we have optimized for the recording and analysis of neural and behavioral data, in addition to
incorporating new methods for recording activity in behaving flies that experience naturalistic, multimodal
courtship stimuli timed to their movements on a spherical treadmill. What we discover in this system will reveal
fundamental principles regarding how brains mediate perceptions, thoughts, actions, and ultimately the ability
to communicate with another individual."

The Center for Gene Therapy at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute of Nationwide Children’s
Hospital (NCH) and the OSU/NCH Center for Muscle Health and Neuromuscular Disease
comprise a robust and active research community in the muscular dystrophies, with a particular
longstanding interest in developing meaningful therapies for the most common forms, including
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). We have extensive expertise in unraveling disease
pathogenesis and developing new treatment paradigms that can be translated from the bench to
the bedside. We propose an MDSRC with Cores designed to share this expertise with the
Wellstone Network and broader muscular dystrophy research communities, with Projects
intended to advance therapies beyond current, very promising prospective therapies, such as
microdystrophin gene therapy. Project 1 (PI, Paul Martin, PhD) seeks to utilize a novel bicistronic
AAV vector to both prevent muscle disease and simultaneously build new muscle function in
muscular dystrophy with Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy 2I (LGMD2I). Project 2 (PI, Kevin
Flanigan, MD) will develop vectors containing U7 small nuclear RNAs (U7snRNAs)
reprogrammed with antisense sequences directed toward splice site or splice enhance elements
to restores expression of a highly functional dystrophin, and to characterize two novel mouse
models relevant to clinical development. Project 3 (PI, Nizar Saad, PhD) seeks to identify novel
circulating biomarkers through the investigation of circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and to
develop a new generations of gene therapy that increase transduction efficiency, dystrophin
expression, and reduce the development of humoral immunity against AAV gene therapies. All
three projects make use of the critical resource core, the Muscular Dystrophy Cell and Serum
Banking Core (Director, Nicolas Wein, PhD) by establishing primary fibroblasts from patients with
muscular dystrophies, a critical resource for early therapy development, while collaborating with
Penny Gilbert, PhD, at the University of Toronto, to develop improved protocols leading to
superior reagents for Center Projects. We have a longstanding dedication to serving as a national
training resource, as demonstrated by our Myology Course, held annually since 2012, and our
Training Core (Director, Scott Harper, PhD) will expand the number of attendees and the range
of topics covered in the Course, offer individualized career development guidance to Wellstone
Fellowship trainees, and develop new curricula of benefit to the community. Our Administrative
Core will implement a meaningful community outreach program and develop a highly functional
MDSRC website to provide access to the muscular dystrophy community. Altogether, our
longstanding efforts and the highly collaborative multidisciplinary environment of our two
institutions will be synergized by a MDSRC that leverages existing structures and collaborations
and develops outward-facing resources of benefit to the broader Wellstone and muscular
dystrophy research communities."
11012730,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eukaryotic cellular stress responses are highly conserved and precisely regulated. When these pathways
malfunction there are often grave physiological consequences in the form of diseases such as cancer,
neurodegenerative disease and autoimmune disorders. Ubiquitin-like modifications (UBLs) are rapid, reversible
and can profoundly alter cell fate and function. Intriguingly, the majority of UBLs are involved in the cellular
response to stress, in particular the response to infection, ER-stress and autophagy. Ubiquitin-like proteins share
structural conservation with ubiquitin and also covalently modify target proteins, however UBLs have extremely
divergent functions, which range from transcriptional repression to autophagy initiation. Unlike ubiquitin, the
consequences of ISGylation or ATG12ylation on target protein fate and function are largely unknown. In this
proposal, we aim to decode the post-translational landscape of the cell following eukaryotic stress responses
using sophisticated proteomics strategies to address the fundamental question of how ISG15 and ATG12 alter
the function of their covalent cellular targets.
For ISG15, my laboratory’s recent work identified a novel role in the control of host metabolic processes and this
proposal addresses how ISGylation of mTOR and other key upstream regulators of the catabolic process of
autophagy tunes the metabolic and catabolic capacity of cells and animals.
For ATG12, we have pioneered an in vivo genetic method coupled with cutting-edge proteomics to identify
endogenous substrates of the autophagy-related ubiquitin-like protein ATG12 following induction of cellular
stress pathways such as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization or endoplasmic reticulum stress."
11022668,"ABSTRACT: HEART AND LUNG OUTCOMES POST-TUBERCULOSIS (HALO Post-TB)
The global prevalence of post-tuberculosis lung disease (PTLD) is estimated to be ~50%, but our understanding
of PTLD is incomplete as studies have not performed full pulmonary function testing (PFTs). Furthermore, the
prevalence of cardiovascular sequelae of TB is largely unknown as few post-TB studies have included
assessments of cardiac structure and function. HIV is a risk factor for TB. We and others have shown that HIV
is associated with cardiopulmonary markers associated with worse mortality including decreased diffusion
capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) on PFTs, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) on
echocardiography, and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).
These US-based studies have included few, if any, individuals with prior TB. To our knowledge, no prior study
has examined pulmonary and cardiac outcomes after TB and the role of HIV as an effect modifier for the
cardiopulmonary phenotypes seen. This Heart and Lung Outcomes Post-TB (HALO Post-TB) study will fill these
gaps. Our central hypothesis is that TB is associated with a higher prevalence of cardiopulmonary disease and
that HIV coinfection modifies cardiopulmonary phenotypes post TB. The overall objectives of this proposal are
to elucidate prevalence, trajectory, and mechanisms of cardiopulmonary abnormalities post-TB in a high TB and
HIV burden country. HALO Post-TB will be a longitudinal cohort study that will enroll people with and without HIV
in Kampala, Uganda including 480 individuals at completion of treatment for pulmonary TB and 120 healthy
comparators who have never had pulmonary TB disease. Specific Aim 1 will perform full PFTs (spirometry, DLco,
and lung volumes), echocardiography, 6-minute walk test, and validated questionnaires to determine the impact
of HIV coinfection on cardiopulmonary function at baseline (completion of TB treatment) and the persistence of
these findings at 2 years. Aim 2 will perform CPET at baseline (completion of TB treatment) in a random subset
of 50% of participants to determine the impact of HIV coinfection on mechanisms underlying cardiorespiratory
fitness. Finally, Aim 3 will examine a panel of 11 plasma biomarkers and use an unbiased machine learning
approach to identify phenotypic clusters and determine whether there are differences in biomarkers that may
identify mechanistic pathways that explain the different phenotypes. The proposed research will include
specimen banking and will serve as the foundational study of the effect of HIV on cardiopulmonary involvement
in post-TB disease, a necessary precursor to identifying mechanisms and potential treatment. The expected
outcome to develop a well-characterized post-TB cohort that includes comprehensive cardiopulmonary
measures to identify distinct cardiopulmonary phenotypes and whether HIV is an effect-modifier on these
phenotypes to enable future mechanistic studies, targeted interventions, and improvements in clinical care."
11030267,"Background: Delays in care (i.e., poor access to timely care) are associated with adverse impacts on
morbidity, mortality and quality of life, as well as poor outcomes from physical and mental health conditions.
The VHA healthcare system has long struggled with access issues, however, VHA's “access crisis” in 2014,
where systemic access problems were identified after whistleblowers revealed intentional cover-ups of long
delays, drew particular outrage as evidence emerged that Veterans had died waiting to see their VHA doctors.
Improving Veterans' access to care continues to be among VHA's top priorities, and while expansion of access
to community providers has been among the most visible approaches to reducing waits and delays, VHA has
implemented numerous initiatives to improve Veterans' timely access to care within VHA as well. These
include development of a group practice manager role to facilitate face-to-face and virtual appointment-making
through call centers and access management tools (e.g., grid validation). Improving access management—
effectively deploying clinic personnel, resources, and processes to achieve timely access—remains a major
challenge nonetheless, especially across widely varying organizational and geographic contexts. Despite their
importance, remarkably little is known about which of these strategies have been implemented, the factors that
support or hinder their use, or their relationship to access metrics.
Specific Aims: To address these gaps, we propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1: To assess national variations in how local VA facilities manage primary care access.
Aim 2: To evaluate how different access management strategies relate to access metrics.
Aim 3: Building on results from Aims 1 and 2, to conduct a national expert panel to come to consensus on
evidence-based practice and policy recommendations to improve access to care.
Methods: For Aim 1, we propose to use key informant-based organizational surveys to assess implementation
of access management strategies on a national basis. We will examine area and organizational determinants
of their uptake, use and implementation by linking resulting survey data with Area Resource File measures
(e.g., urban/rural, primary care shortage area), facility characteristics (e.g., complexity, academic affiliation),
and other organizational measures (e.g., PACT Implementation Index). For Aim 2, we will then link data from
Aim 1 to VHA access metrics, including both administrative (e.g., appointment wait times) and patient-reported
access measures (e.g., obtained care when needed). For Aim 3, we will use modified Delphi panel techniques
to bring together VA and non-VA experts in access management, primary care, care coordination and other
areas to generate evidence-based recommendations based on data from Aims 1 and 2.
Anticipated Impacts on Veterans' Healthcare: The proposed study will provide critical information for VA
leadership to better understand which access management strategies have been implemented, what has
driven uptake and implementation, the barriers and facilitators to their use, and which of them are in fact
associated with better performance on access metrics. No other data sources are available to lay the
groundwork for evidence-based approaches to solving VHA's access crisis on this scale despite the resources
being applied. This study will yield multilevel targets for intervention and implementation in partnership with
senior leaders and other stakeholders.
Next Steps: We will work with leaders in Primary Care and Office of Veterans' Access to Care to disseminate
findings to the field. During the Expert Panel, we will confer with panelists to identify optimal means of
communication, including but not limited to issues briefs, toolkits, field guides, workgroups or other methods."
11030275,"Background: Major health care transformations within and outside of VA are now providing Veterans with
unprecedented health care choices. Within VA, under recent federal legislation integrated networks of
community providers and public reporting of access and quality at VA facilities are aiming to expand health
care choices for Veterans and improve the timeliness of services. Outside of VA, many lower-income Veterans
in states that expanded Medicaid now have a public insurance option, while privately-insured Veterans are
increasingly facing high deductibles in their health plans.
Significance/Impact: Major shifts in health care financing and delivery present Veterans with opportunities to
make decisions about their use of VA and non-VA health care that optimize the timeliness, affordability, quality,
and patient-centeredness of their care. However, these decisions also carry great potential for unintended
consequences if they are not well-informed. Despite such high stakes, little is known about how Veterans are
making decisions about using VA and non-VA care, what information they want to use in this decision-making,
and how provision of information to Veterans about their health care options could be improved. Understanding
these issues is critical to the success of national efforts to expand health care choices for Veterans under the
VA MISSION Act and to achieve a VA health care system that is maximally responsive to Veterans’ needs.
Innovation: This study is the first to assess the views, experiences, and information needs of Veterans who
are users and non-users of VA health care.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Examine how Veterans are making decisions about VA and non-VA care and what
information they want to use when making these decisions. Aim 2: Identify correlates of Veterans’ decisions to
use and experiences with using VA and non-VA health care. Aim 3: Engage Veterans and VA leaders to
identify opportunities to optimize Veterans’ decisions about use of VA and non-VA care and VA’s
responsiveness to Veterans’ health care preferences.
Methodology: We will partner with Veterans organizations to conduct focus groups and semi-structured
interviews that will examine decision-making experiences of Veterans who use VA care, non-VA care, or both;
the sources of information Veterans have used and would want to use in this decision-making; and Veterans’
experiences with the timeliness, affordability, quality, and patient-centeredness of VA and non-VA care. We will
use these findings to develop and field a national survey of Veterans’ use of and decision-making about VA
and non-VA care; factors related to their decision-making and health needs; and perceptions of the timeliness,
affordability, quality, and patient-centeredness of their health care. The nationally representative sample of
3,000 Veterans will include both users and non-users of VA health care. We will identify Veteran characteristics
associated with use of VA and non-VA health care services and with their health care experiences in VA and
community health care settings. Finally, we will conduct deliberative forums with Veterans and VA operational
leaders to develop actionable strategies that can be used to support Veterans’ decisions about VA and non-VA
health care. Using a combination of deliberation and design methods, we will share key findings from the first 2
Aims and then guide participants through a collaborative process in which they will identify and prioritize
programs and policies that could support Veteran decision-making about use of VA and non-VA care.
Next Steps/Implementation: Products will include a compendium of the types of information Veterans use
and need for decision-making about VA and non-VA care, new survey measures to assess Veterans’ decisions
about VA and non-VA care, and a prioritized list of programs and policies that could be implemented to help
Veterans make decisions about VA and non-VA care. We will use these products to work with our VA and non-
VA partners to develop new strategies to optimize Veteran decision-making about VA and non-VA care."

incidence) contributes to Post-Operative Delirium (POD) in elderly population (≥65yrs). Notably, 11% of
these elderly patients suffer from Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias, placing them at an even
higher risk of POD. PASCALL was founded to introduce a novel neuroscience-based EEG-guided
personalized anesthetic management. In our sister grant, AG066325, we proposed and achieved a)
(AG066325 Aim 1,2) the design, development, and FDA 510(k) pre-market clearance of a wireless
anesthetic brain monitor, designated as M0 and b) (AG066325 Aim 3) the development of personalized
algorithms to monitor anesthetic brain state in aging, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease patients.
In this grant, we aim to fully address the problem by utilizing two recently developed, highly interpretable
brain state markers, the Alpha Modulation Index (AMI) and Slow Frequency Modulation Index (SMI),
along with a patient-specific instantaneous responsiveness algorithm (PSIRA). PSIRA can inform the
anesthesia care giver about the dosing required to maintain a target level of unconsciousness, based on
AMI and SMI indices. In this grant, we focus only on patients receiving propofol, the most widely used
intravenous anesthetic agent. The primary innovations of this project are 1) the highly interpretable
brain state markers and 2) the PSIRA algorithm for unconsciousness management to provide
anesthetic dosage recommendation to minimize POD. We realize this innovation through 4 specific
aims. Aim 1: Demonstrate the technical feasibility of the unconsciousness management system for
intraoperative anesthesia based on AMI/SMI and PSIRA. Aim 2: develop an elderly patient-specific age-
normalized AMI and SMI brain state markers. Aim 3: Fully implement the unconsciousness management
system for general anesthesia with dosage guidance for intravenous propofol on the PASCALL FDA-
cleared M0 monitor. Aim 4: Develop commercialization roadmap for the PSIRA system.
If successful, this effort will bring neuroscience-based precision anesthesia care to millions of older
patients, saving Medicare ~$44,000 per patient per year and eliminating needless suffering including
long-term functional and cognitive disability."

The overall goal of this project is to understand how HIV-1 packages its RNA genome. During virus assembly,
two copies of the viral RNA are trafficked to the plasma membrane and anchored to assembly sites by a small
number of viral Gag polyproteins (~24 or fewer). The resulting complex functions as a nucleant for further virus
assembly, recruiting additional Gag molecules and promoting budding. Although mechanistic and atomic level
details are unknown, studies suggest that assembly of the Gag:RNA complex is mediated by a combination of
intermolecular interactions between the capsid (CA) domains of Gag, and between Gag’s nucleocapsid domain
(NC) and an RNA packaging signal (ΨCES) located within the 5′-untranslated region of the genome. The proposed
studies aim to (i) identify the structural determinants and mechanism of Gag assembly on the viral RNA
packaging signal during different stages of assembly (supported by the K99). Additionally, the proposal aims to
(ii) collect more structural information of host cell factor interaction, specifically Staufen1, with the viral RNA
(R00), raising potential novel target sites for drug development.
The K99 research, conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Michael F. Summers (primary mentor at UMBC) and
Dr. Owen Pornillos (secondary mentor at the University of Utah), will employ an integrated structural biology
approach, where isotope-edited nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) will be used to determine key
intermolecular Gag:Gag and Gag:RNA interactions that promote assembly, and Cryogenic Electron Microscopy
to visualize atomic-level details of the Gag:RNA complex that nucleates virus assembly. Mechanistic hypotheses
will be tested by in-cell studies under the guidance of virologist Dr. Alice Telesnitsky (member of the advisory
committee at University of Michigan). Expertise developed in NMR, Cryogenic Electron microscopy, and cellular
techniques will prepare me for an independent career to work within the broader area of host-virus RNP
interactions. Overall, these studies will provide the first structural and mechanistic insights for the
ribonucleoprotein complex that nucleates HIV-1 assembly and its interactions with essential host factors and will
provide Dr. Hollmann skills to establish an independent and inclusive research program."

 Cryopreservation of oocytes, embryos and other small biological samples plays a key role in medicine, in
biomedical research, and in assisted reproduction of humans, domestic animals, biomedical research animals,
and endangered species. Hundreds of thousands of genetically distinct strains of species including pigs, fruit
flies, and zebrafish are maintained for biomedical research purposes. Many species/strains are maintained as
live stocks or are propagated by cloning because reliable and cost-effective oocyte/embryo cryopreservation
technology is not available. Such technology would provide benefits including simplification of protocols,
protection against genetic drift from generation to generation, preservation of culled stocks, and protection
against disasters. Current cryopreservation approaches involve soaking samples in cryoprotectant solutions,
cooling by hand plunging in liquid nitrogen, and warming by hand plunging in a warm solution. Poor post-thaw
survival and development outcomes are primarily associated with ice formation, although osmotic shock during
soaks, cryoprotectant toxicity, sample microfracturing, and phase transitions and chemical changes in lipids can
contribute. Some improvement in cryopreservation outcomes has been achieved using alternative warming
methods based on, e.g., electromagnetic energy absorption by injected nanoparticles.
 This project aims to develop and validate cryopreservation technology that automates soaking, cooling, and
warming; that optimizes conventional convective heat transfer to increase cooling rates in liquid nitrogen and
warming rates in aqueous solutions by factors of 102 over current practice; that can eliminate ice formation and
associated damage and allow cryoprotectant concentrations to be reduced; that reduces cooling and warming
times toward ~1 millisecond, allowing other damage mechanisms to be outrun; and that improves reproducibility
of key steps, facilitating optimization of other factors important to successful outcomes. This work is informed by
studies of ice formation in aqueous solutions during fast cooling and warming; by MiTeGen’s expertise and
technology base in ultra-fast cooling using liquid nitrogen; by expertise in diagnostics including time-resolved x-
ray diffraction and high speed optical imaging that can detect and quantify ice formed in oocytes/embryos during
cooling and warming; and by extensive preliminary studies on bovine oocytes and embryos demonstrating the
feasibility of fully ice-free cryopreservation and how ultra-fast cooling improves developmental outcomes.
 Technology to be developed includes a flexible robot-based workstation with stations for soaking, liquid
removal, ultra-fast cooling, and ultra-fast warming; and ultra-low thermal mass sample supports that maximize
convective cooling and warming rates while retaining samples through all steps. This technology will be
validated, first, through measurements of cooling/warming rates and ice formation in aqueous cryoprotectant
solutions and, second, through studies of ice formation in and post-thaw survival, development, and
transcriptomes of bovine and porcine embryos."
11008869,"Imaging the currents in the brain is critical to our understanding of brain function and is an important technique
to study neurological disorders such as traumatic brain injury, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. The gold standard
for high spatial resolution of human visual brain activity is fMRI, but development of lower-cost brain imaging
systems is needed to expand access. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common method of brain functional
imaging, involving the placement of arrays of electrodes on or through the scalp. However, electrical signals
can be distorted as they propagate through the head, obscuring signal interpretation.
Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a promising method of functional brain imaging that has seen a recent
surge of interest. MEG directly images the unattenuated magnetic fields produced by neuronal currents via a
helmet sensor-array. However, magnetic fields produced by the brain are extremely faint. For decades, MEG
has required ultra-sensitive magnetic field measurements enabled by SQUIDs to noninvasively detect brain
activity. However SQUIDs require cryogenic operation, resulting in a cm-scale standoff that limits the
achievable spatial resolution and signal strength. More recently, optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs)
have been introduced that have a comparable sensitivity to SQUIDs. However, OPMs must be heated to ~150o
C, requiring additional standoff to avoid patient discomfort. They also can only operate in a zero-magnetic field
environment, which can typically only be accommodated by costly magnetically-shielded rooms in elite
hospitals, and they have a limited dynamic range of ~5 nanotesla.
Diamond quantum sensors. We are developing miniature magnetic field diamond quantum sensors that
operate at ambient temperatures and in Earth’s magnetic field. They feature a dynamic range of ~1000 nT and
a sensor-scalp standoff of ~1 mm, which offers advantages in both signal strength and spatial resolution
compared to SQUIDs and OPMs. Their ability to operate in Earth’s magnetic field potentially removes the need
of a magnetically shielded environment, expanding MEG access beyond elite hospitals. Our sensor offers
these advantages by incorporating three innovations in diamond quantum sensing technology:
i) Magnetic flux concentrators. Our team has recently discovered a method of enhancing the magnetic
sensitivity of diamond quantum sensors based on ferrite magnetic flux concentrators.
ii) Infrared absorption readout. Our team has pioneered an approach to diamond quantum sensing, based
on infrared absorption, that offers much higher sensitivity.
iii) Mitigating microwave phase noise. We are developing a dual-resonance approach that provides ~300x
suppression of microwave phase noise to reach our sensitivity goals.
In Phase I, we focus on Aim 1) Build a miniature flux-concentrator diamond sensor with infrared absorption
detection. Aim 2) Demonstrate a sensitivity of ~10 femtotesla for 1 second integration."
11010506,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Normal hedonic function, or `liking' reactions to positive affective
events, is essential for mental health.1–3 Dysfunction in hedonic brain circuitry may contribute to mood disorders,
addiction, and eating disorders. 1,4 Brain mechanisms of reward `liking' remain relatively less understood than
mechanisms of incentive motivation (`wanting) and reward learning. `Liking' reactions can be amplified by a
network of hedonic hotspots, which are small subregions of nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, orbitofrontal
cortex, and insula that are uniquely able, when neurochemically or optogenetically stimulated, to causally
increase the hedonic impact of palatable rewards.1,5–10 The primary goal of this proposal is to advance
understanding of `liking' circuitry by investigating circuit-level functional interactions between hedonic
hotspots that amplify `liking', examining neuronal coding of `liking' impact within hedonic hotspots, and
consolidating my discovery of a novel hedonic hotspot in anterior cingulate cortex. To date I've shown that
optogenetically activating hotspots in rostromedial orbitofrontal cortex, posterior ventral pallidum, and caudal
insula doubles affective orofacial `liking' reactions to sucrose.9,10 Conversely, optogenetically inhibiting the
ventral pallidum hotspot generates pathologically intense `disgust' reactions to normally `liked' sweetness.10
Using cell-specific optogenetic techniques in GAD1-Cre rats, I've further shown that GABAergic neurons in the
ventral pallidum hotspot are specifically responsible for bidirectional control of `liking' (Aim 1). The F99 phase
of this award will further test the hypothesis that multiple hotspots are unanimously recruited to control `liking'
when one hotspot is stimulated (Aim 2c-b), and will confirm my discovery of a novel hedonic hotspot in caudal
anterior cingulate cortex (Aim 2a). I will use optogenetic ChR2 stimulation to excite a hotspot and analyze Fos
expression patterns in the other hotspots to confirm recruitment. Further, using in vivo calcium imaging, I will
confirm recruitment of ventral pallidum GABA hotspot neurons when the OFC hotspot is optogenetically
stimulated to generate `liking' enhancements. I will also test the necessity of unanimous recruitment by
optogenetically stimulating one hedonic hotspot (e.g. OFC) while simultaneously disrupting the other (e.g. VP).
The proposed training will facilitate my transition to a competitive postdoctoral fellowship by allowing me to
learn immunohistochemistry, dual site brain manipulations, and in-vivo calcium imaging. For the KOO Phase
(Aim3), I will identify a postdoctoral lab enabling me to investigate how homeostatic circuitry modulates reward
system functions to influence `liking' reactions and `wanting'. I have particular interest in how hedonic reward
systems interact with regulatory hunger/satiety circuits in hypothalamus. A F99/K00 award will be invaluable
towards my transition to independence by facilitating postdoctoral training in molecular, genetic, and
electrophysiological techniques that will complement my current expertise in hedonic circuitry manipulations.
Overall, this work may help elucidate neural mechanisms underlying hedonic dysfunction in affective disorders."
11009193,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Roughly 1 in 8 Americans living with HIV are unaware of their infection. As an entry point into the healthcare
system, emergency departments (EDs) are uniquely positioned to help reduce this burden of undiagnosed HIV
in the U.S. A growing amount of all healthcare in the U.S. is delivered in an ED setting. Unfortunately, compared
with other settings, EDs have some of the lowest HIV testing rates. These rates further declined leading up to
the COVID-19 pandemic and despite renewed efforts in the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative.
Decreasing testing rates appear to stem from several barriers, including concerns about cost and the impact of
increased testing on overcrowding and boarding. Unfortunately, few studies have focused on exploring these
barriers, either since EHE’s launch or following the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary purpose of this award is
to provide Dr. Christopher Bennett, Assistant Professor of Emergency Medicine at Stanford University, the
support necessary to facilitate their long-term goals to (1) help EDs lead the charge in ending the HIV epidemic
in the U.S. and (2) transition from a junior investigator to an independent physician–scientist with expertise in
economic analyses, implementation science, and qualitative methods. In Aim 1, Dr. Bennett will train in economic
analyses to investigate the cost-effectiveness of ED-based HIV screening in geographic areas targeted by EHE
compared against current screening rates and then determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of HIV
screening in all U.S. EDs. In Aims 2 and 3, the candidate will innovatively leverage a recent California initiative
in which 28 local EDs received funding to implement or expand routine, opt-out HIV screening. Specifically, in
Aim 2, Dr. Bennett will train in implementation science to create a typology of the screening strategies used by
these EDs; this work will be informed by a stakeholder group of ED leaders with efforts guided by the Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. In Aim 3, Dr. Bennett will obtain
additional training in qualitative methods to employ semi-structured interviews of a diverse cohort – frontline ED
providers implementing HIV screening and persons tested for HIV at these EDs – at a subset of these sites to
illuminate firsthand barriers and facilitators encountered during the real-world implementation of HIV screening
programs, guided by the updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). This K08 award
is designed to leverage Dr. Bennett’s clinical training and build upon their background in epidemiology and health
services research. This innovative K08 responds to several NIH priorities for HIV and HIV-related research and
will aid decision makers in identifying which strategies work for different communities. Overall, this work will
advance EHE’s mission to make HIV screening routine in all settings that serve a high volume of racial, ethnic,
sexual, and gender minority groups, with focused approaches to enable testing for more people at risk for HIV."

11019006,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading infectious pathogen, causing pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, acute
otitis media, and nearly one million deaths worldwide each year. S. pneumoniae can be carried in the
nasopharynx asymptomatically, which contributes to pathogen spread, as pneumococcal carriage often
precedes active infection. Infections occur with increased frequency in high-risk populations, such as individuals
with diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and HIV. Several
vaccines are currently in use to prevent pneumococcal infection; however, several factors warrant further
research, including limited serotype coverage of current vaccines, limited vaccine efficacy against some vaccine-
included serotypes, increased incidence of colonization and infection with non-vaccine serotypes, and
widespread drug and multidrug antibiotic resistance among non-vaccine serotypes. This R01 proposal will
address these limitations by defining the structural determinants mediating the serotype breadth and
protective efficacy of broadly-reactive human mAbs that prevent and treat pneumococcal infection. The
scientific premise of this proposal is that mAbs to conserved pneumococcal antigens that are broadly reactive
could serve as priority or adjunctive therapies for pneumococcal disease management. This proposal will focus
on mAbs to pneumococcal antigens that are highly conserved and are targets of B cells during pneumococcal
colonization and infection. Our work will advance the field by generating new therapeutic options for the
prevention and treatment of pneumococcal infection for diverse serotypes, including encapsulated and
nonencapsulated serotypes, and by identifying protective epitopes on pneumococcal surface proteins. Our
innovative hypothesis is that human mAbs targeting conserved pneumococcal surface proteins will exhibit
substantial serotype breadth, can treat pneumococcal infection, and that mAb protective efficacy and serotype
breadth is correlated to epitope specificity. Our data will provide new findings for the pneumococcal protein
vaccine field. In Aim 1, the serotype breadth and protective efficacy of human mAbs targeting conserved protein
antigens will be determined in models of both primary and secondary (following influenza virus infection)
pneumococcal infection. In Aim 2, we will define the epitopes mediating the protective efficacy of the human
mAbs using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, which will be critical to the field by informing the development
of protein-based pneumococcal vaccines, as we have shown in our preliminary data that the epitope on
pneumococcal proteins impacts mAb breadth and protective efficacy. In Aim 3, we will conduct in depth in vitro
and in vivo mechanistic studies to assess mAb functions, including opsonophagocytic and agglutination activity,
and inhibition of bacterial growth, adhesion, invasion, and biofilm formation. We will also assess the specific
immunological pathways important for mAb-mediated bacterial clearance. Overall, our work is both practically
and conceptually innovative, and will challenge current treatment paradigms for pneumococcal infection."
11020163,"Abstract
New therapeutic options are needed to treat people infected with multi-drug resistant HIV-1 phenotypes. Here
we propose to both investigate and exploit the non-catalytic, essential function of HIV-1 integrase (IN) during
virion morphogenesis as a novel therapeutic target. Our highly collaborative research team has already made
important contributions toward these goals. Specifically, our studies have revealed that IN binds the viral RNA
genome (vRNA) in virions and that these interactions enable formation of properly matured, infectious HIV-1
particles. Moreover, we found that IN tetramers bind with high affinity to select vRNA elements. These findings
have begun to uncover mechanistic details behind the non-catalytic function of IN. We have been also
investigating the mode of action of a promising class of novel antiretroviral agents termed allosteric HIV-1
inhibitors or ALLINIs. Our studies have demonstrated that ALLINIs inhibit IN-vRNA interactions in virions by
inducing aberrant IN multimerization. Consequently, ALLINI treatments yield inactive virus particles with
ribonucleoprotein complexes mislocalized outside of the protective capsid. Our more recent studies have
focused on characterizing the antiviral mechanism of action of a lead clinical candidate ALLINI pirmitegravir (PIR,
STP0404) discovered by ST Pharm, Republic of Korea. This highly safe and potent HIV-1 inhibitor has recently
advanced into Phase 2 clinical trials in the USA. Here we propose to build on our highly successful research and
have set out the following two multidisciplinary and complementary specific aims. In aim1, we will continue our
investigation into the non-catalytic role of IN during virion morphogenesis. For this, we will use biochemical
assays to delineate sequence and structural features of vRNA preferentially recognized by HIV-1 IN.
Furthermore, we will determine cryo-EM structures of IN tetramers bound to cognate vRNA segments. In
addition, we’ll develop a novel and powerful in vitro model system for assembly of mature virus like particles by
using IN mediated encapsulation of vRNA inside capsid like particles. Taken together, these studies will markedly
advance our understanding of the non-catalytic function of IN during virion morphogenesis and the underlying
mechanisms for assembly of mature virions. In Aim 2, we will continue our investigation into a highly promising
investigational drug PIR. Specifically, we will delineate the mechanism for how PIR impairs IN-vRNA interactions.
Furthermore, our structural, biochemistry and virology experiments will uncover the underlying mechanisms for
drug-resistance to PIR. In turn, the findings from these studies will inform our medicinal chemistry efforts to
rationally develop improved chemotypes with an enhanced barrier to resistance. Collectively, the two specific
aims will elucidate key aspects of the HIV-1 IN biology and will exploit these insights to advance novel therapies
to treat people living with HIV-1.

11012575,"PROJECT SUMMARY
After decades of intensive research and drug development efforts, there are still no cures or substantially
effective treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Currently available medications, including cholinesterase
inhibitors, NMDA receptor antagonists, and amyloid beta (Aβ) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), can only reduce
certain symptoms or slightly slow down disease progression in mild to moderate AD patients; and their side
effects, particularly those of Aβ mAbs, further limit their benefit. The most recently reported efficacy and safety
profile of another Aβ mAb donanemab does not add much enthusiasm to the field. Studies of AD have been
mainly focused on Aβ plaques and tau protein-formed neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. However, in recent
years, it is increasingly clear that the development of AD is the collective consequence of the toxicities induced
by Aβ plaques, tau protein-formed neurofibrillary tangles, and malfunctions of microglia. Nacetylcysteine
(NAC) is a derivative of amino acid cysteine; it has been studied for its potential effects on AD, largely due to
its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, particularly its beneficial effects on microglia. However, NAC
cannot penetrate the BBB and reach the brain sufficiently. To realize NAC’s potential as an AD treatment, we
developed a brain targeted NAC delivery system (TN-NAC). Our preliminary data demonstrate that TN-NAC
can effectively cross the BBB, quench the elevated ROS, attenuate the activation of microglia, reduce Aβ
burden, and eliminate senescent cells in the brain in a 5xFAD mouse model, and improve the performance of
the animals in behavior tests. Based on these exciting data, in this Phase I STTR study, we will test the
feasibility to develop TN-NAC as a therapy for AD through two specific aims. In SA1 we will evaluate the
toxicity and pharmacokinetic properties of TN-NAC in mice. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TN-NAC
will be first determined in mice; and then the PK properties of TN-NAC at various doses will be examined. In
SA2 we will test the therapeutic efficacy of TN-NAC in a 3xTg-AD mouse model. We will assess the effects of
TNNAC on biochemical, pathological, and behavioral alterations in the AD mice. We will also further evaluate
the systemic toxicity of TN-NAC in AD mice. The successful completion of the proposed studies will serve as a
milestone for the further development effort. A Go/No Go decision will be made based on 1) if TN-NAC can
achieve sufficient blood and brain NAC concentrations at a certain dose without causing evident toxicity in
mice; and 2) if TN-NAC at that dose can significantly attenuate AD pathology and behavioral impairment in the
AD mice. A Go decision will lead us in a STTR Phase 2 study to: 1) using large animal models to find a dose
range that can be extrapolated to humans and test the safety and efficacy of TN-NAC for the treatment of AD in
a GLP setting using large animal models, and 2) carrying out cGMP manufacturing of TN-NAC for human
studies. These studies will enable us to file an IND application to FDA."
11008685,"The latent infection of human immunodeficiency type 1 virus (HIV) is the major hurdle to the eradication of HIV.
A better understanding of the molecular basis of HIV latency is essential for the development of proper strategies
to attack such stable HIV reservoirs. HIV latency is largely controlled by epigenetic regulations surrounding the
chromatin proximal to the HIV promoter, i.e. HIV long terminal repeats (LTR). However, our understanding of
epigenetic regulation of HIV transcription remains incomplete. This is evidenced by the fact that an effective
reduction of HIV reservoirs has not been achieved in people with HIV (PWH) by the inhibition of histone
deacetylase alone or in combination with other latency reversal reagents.
We recently found that HIV transcription was activated from latency when crotonylation is induced. This was
associated with enhanced histone crotonylation and acetylation but reduced histone methylation at the HIV LTR.
Crotonylation induction also enhanced latency reversal elicited by the activation of NF-κB signaling pathway.
Importantly, while crotonylation is controlled by the same enzymes stimulating acetylation to activate gene
transcription (e.g. p300), crotonylation and its downstream signaling are regulated by distinct mechanisms, which
are independent of histone acetylation. Furthermore, unlike the inhibitory role of acetylation reader BRD4 in HIV
transcription, the crotonylation reader ENL is essential for HIV latency reversal elicited by the induction of histone
crotonylation. Of interest, the opposite may also hold. For example, although crotonylation is reversed by the
same enzymes regulating deacetylation to induce latency (e.g. HDACs), decrotonylation-efficient but
deacetylation-deficient HDAC3 directly suppresses the Tat transactivation of HIV. Lastly, we discovered several
selective HDCR inhibitors (HDCRi) that prefer to induce histone crotonylation over acetylation in both T cells and
brain myeloid cells. These selective HDCR inhibitors did not dock into the deacetylation enzymatic pocket at the
HDAC3 crystal structure predicted by Google AlphaFold. Instead, they docked just outside the enzymatic pocket,
distinct from the nonspecific HDACi SAHA. Of note, one such HDCRi prevented HIV entry to latency.
The overall objective of this application is to determine the molecular mechanism of histone decrotonylation
underlying HIV latency. We hypothesize that distinct from histone deacetylation, decrotonylation plays an
important role in the establishment of HIV latency, and this can be applied to our current efforts to control HIV
latency by preventing HIV entry into latency. Our goals will be achieved through 3 specific aims, directed at the
following premises:
Aim 1: Crotonylation is distinct from acetylation to regulate HIV transcription.
Aim 2: Decrotonylation uniquely regulates HIV latency.
Aim 3: Pharmacologic modulating decrotonylation prevents the establishment of HIV latency."

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), composed of Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is the most
common chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Over the last decade, the prevalence
of IBD has increased two to three-fold, with incidences as high as 1.3% in US adults, and significant efforts have
been devoted to profiling IBD using multi-omics approaches to understand molecular drivers of disease,
however, there remains major knowledge gaps in the temporal processes regulating inflammatory states in the
gut at disease onset and during flare-ups. In addition, top pharmaceutical companies collectively spent ~$7B on
R&D in 2022 allocated to GI-related diseases but over a third of patients are regularly failing to respond to first
line therapeutic modalities. Therefore, there is a continued demand for novel interventions that are better tailored
to the patient.
 The GI lining is constantly renewed, as ~1010 intestinal epithelial cells are shed into the digesta daily, and
end up into the stool, with the host cells’ DNA and RNA contents. The exfoliome, i.e. the RNA content exfoliated
from host cells, is a valuable tool to gather insights into the gene expression patterns, cellular signatures, and
biological processes occurring in the gastrointestinal tract, making it potentially useful for understanding IBD.,
and providing a non-invasive means to longitudinally profile dynamic processes occurring within the GI tract.
However, numerous technical obstacles prevent direct exfoliome analysis from stool.
 Foli Bio Inc. has developed an innovative technology, called Exfo-seq, to sequence fecal exfoliome in a highly
sensitive and quantitative manner. Exfo-seq is based on a proprietary signal amplification approach and enables
to precisely and robustly quantify the expression level of several thousand of host genes directly from stool RNA.
In this proposed project, Foli Bio aims to validate the functional utility of Exfo-seq using samples collected from
IBD clinical trial. The overarching goal of this project is to generate unprecedented knowledge regarding the
human GI exfoliome at baseline and over time, and examine the local gut immune profile, evaluate heterogeneity
in inflammatory states between individuals, identify early biomarkers, and predict therapeutic response. More
importantly, Foli Bio believes this technology holds great potential as a non-invasive method to transform future
GI drug development and will substantially benefit pharmaceutical companies as well as the larger population of
IBD patients who remain underserved by the current treatment paradigms in IBD."

Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) provide the safety and efficacy data that inform decision-making
throughout the healthcare ecosystem, from regulatory approval and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) for
reimbursement to society guidelines and physician decision-making. Despite serving this crucial function, the
current methods used to perform SLRs are highly work-intensive, with the typical review completed manually in
Excel–and taking an average of $141,000 and 18 months. This has led to a deficiency in coverage of key
research questions, with only 10-17% of clinical topics having an up-to-date SLR.
While some workflow tools exist for specific SLR steps, no conventional SLR tools provide either all-in-one
Search, Screening, and Extraction of data or artificial intelligence (AI) assistance at any step. Both the Data
and Informatics Working Group of the NIH and the scientific community have recognized that the bottleneck in
clinical science is in evidence synthesis and a novel software ecosystem is needed to solve this pressing
problem. Nested Knowledge was founded in 2018 to build a platform for collecting, analyzing, and presenting
data. The platform is divided into AutoLit, a full workflow for ‘living’, updatable, AI-assisted Search, Screening,
and Extraction from full texts, and Synthesis, an interactive data-visualization hub with qualitative SLR findings
and insights as well as automated Network Meta-analytical statistics. Since launching, the platform has been
adopted by leading research institutions, 6 of the top 10 HTA providers, and the US standard-setting body for
HTA, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER).
Nested Knowledge’s software provides every step demanded by SLR professionals, and with the advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs), textual extraction has been proven feasible. In fact, we have built and
launched a biomedical-specific LLM for extracting from full texts. However, a key step remains entirely manual:
extraction of Interventions, Data Elements, and Timepoints from tables in published studies. This vital and
work-intensive step has been recognized as the next frontier of AI-assisted SLR, and in this Phase I SBIR
proposal, we propose to build, test, and launch an LLM-based tool for extracting data from tables, which can
then be fed into existing automated Network Meta-analytical tools in the platform.
If successful, this SBIR grant will provide the research community with a biomedical-specific tabular extraction
LLM, integrated into an existing SLR workflow with a human oversight module. This project will also quantify
the performance of this LLM to enable iterative improvement and support both commercialization of this tool
and further research integrating text, table, and figure extraction to move closer to the ultimate goal of near- or
fully-automated synthesis of data from published clinical studies."

weak or deep-seated targets, single-view limitations, surface-imaging of diffuse light distributions, an
anatomical information gap akin to nuclear imaging, and qualitative or semi-quantitative image analysis
issues. InVivo Analytics (IVAX) is addressing these challenges, focusing on improving imaging
sensitivity, devising practical multi-view imaging solutions and anatomical co-registration, tackling
complexities in fast 3D tomography while overcoming surface imaging constraints, and exploring
operator independent BLI quantification for enhanced data reproducibility. The introduction of a Multi-
Aperture (MA) method, featuring a concentric mirror system and a novel stray-light collimator, promises
a significant boost in sensitivity and facilitates multi-view imaging and 3D tomography. Complemented
by the Body-Conforming Animal Mold (BCAM) and Organ Probability Map (OPM), IVAX ensures instant
anatomical co-registration without complex hardware, fostering spatial data congruency and automated
quantification across animals. Therefore, IVAX envisions a novel modular imaging platform –
InVivoSCAN – a compact table-top unit that comprises a camera base and three distinct detector head
modules tailored for specific imaging applications, including planar high-throughput, 3D tomographic,
and multi-view imaging. The modular design, coupled with the MA method, BCAM, and OPM, offers an
unprecedented blend of low-cost accessibility and high-performance imaging capabilities. In Phase I,
IVAX aims to confirm the ability to enhance Signal-To-Noise Ratio (SNR) with the novel MA method and
to validate the reduction of stray light using a novel collimator. Milestones are set high, with an
anticipated SNR improvement of over 2× and a substantial reduction of stray light to less than 3% on the
animal surface. Phase II will focus on the development of the modular imaging platform and will
determine its in vivo performance characteristics. InVivoSCAN's modular design not only simplifies
complexity but also embraces adaptability to diverse research needs. From entry-level affordability to
high-performance configurations, InVivoSCAN caters to a broad customer base. The innovative MA
method, collimator, BCAM, and OPM emerge as central elements, ensuring increased imaging
sensitivity, and facilitating accurate co-registration across different modalities. In essence, InVivoSCAN
represents a quantum leap in preclinical imaging, delivering an amalgamation of innovation,
accessibility, and practicality that transcends the boundaries of conventional imaging systems."
11008000,"Pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting (PINV) afflicts 50-85% of all pregnancies, of which there
are 4 million each year in the US alone. Symptoms, often disabling and sometimes severe and
unremitting, occur in 80% of sufferers at random times throughout the day, and typically persist
throughout the first and early second trimester, and occasionally much longer. Currently available
treatments, of which only one is FDA-approved, require oral ingestion and retention of medication
multiple times daily, which can be challenging in the face of unrelenting nausea or vomiting.
The proposed SBIR Phase I project aims to complete the pharmaceutical development of a
transdermal dosage form designed to deliver the 5-HT3 antagonist anti-nauseant ondansetron to
treat pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting (PINV). The final product will be a small patch
which is applied once or twice weekly. Following an initial lag period on the first day of dosing, the
product will deliver therapeutic quantities of drug continually throughout the period of application
without the need for oral administration.
Our product is intended to provide a safe, effective, and tolerable outpatient treatment for
PINV that avoids the oral route of administration entirely. It is based on a proprietary skin
penetration enhancement system which increases ondansetron absorption through the skin by
450-fold over unenhanced formulations. In a pre-IND meeting, we have obtained FDA’s guidance
on the path to regulatory approval. Once approved, this novel product will present a cost-effective,
convenient alternative to pregnant women suffering with PINV.
The aims of this proposed SBIR Phase I program for a transdermal ondansetron product are to:
1) complete optimization of product design, 2) produce pilot scale patches which conform to
product specifications, and 3) conduct IND-enabling dermal safety studies. Upon successful
completion of this program, an SBIR Phase II follow-up program will be proposed that will include
filing an IND, scale-up and manufacturing of clinical suppllies, and conducting a clinical
pharmacokinetics proof-of-concept study in healthy volunteers, while in parallel performing a
repeat-dose dermal toxicity study in minipigs to support longer-term clinical studies in pregnant
women."
11010443,"RNA abasic sites are recently identified modifications in RNA that are generated by
methylpurine glycosylase to regulate gene expression. They are abundant in RNA and they
stabilize RNA yet we do not know much about how they form, their precursors, and their
functions.
DNA abasic sites were identified in the 1960s and those discoveries led to the elucidation of the
base excision repair pathway in DNA damage. But RNA abasic sites were largely unknown,
except those generated by the plant poison, ricin, in ribosomal RNA. While studying proteins
that bind to the nucleic acid structure, R-loop, we identified RNA modification enzymes and
methylpurine glycosylase as well as apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease I that were known to
process DNA abasic sites.
We have now shown that methylpurine glycosylase cleaves the glycosidic bond in RNA to form
abasic sites and these reactions occur on RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids of R-loops. By mass
spectrometry, we found that RNA abasic sites are rather abundant, there are tens to hundreds
of thousands of them in each cell. We also found in an enhancer RNA of APOE, N6-
methyladenosines are cleaved by methylpurine glycosylase to form RNA abasic sites on R-
loops. The abasic sites then stabilize R-loops and pause RNA Polymerase II transcription. We
show that this mechanism keeps the noncoding RNA poised to activate APOE expression in
response to cellular demands.
Given that we have early evidence for the role of RNA abasic sites in the regulation of
noncoding RNA, it is necessary to better understand them. We propose to 1) examine the
genome-wide effect of nucleic-acid-mediated pausing on noncoding RNA, 2) identify other
glycosylases that form RNA abasic sites, and 3) determine what other modified RNA bases are
precursors of RNA abasic sites. Together, these results will characterize RNA abasic sites by
finding how they form and what they do."
11009433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People living with HIV (PLWH) have an estimated 1.6-6.0 times increased risk of developing oropharyngeal
cancer (OPC) compared with individuals in the general population. 70% of OPCs are caused by human
papillomavirus (HPV), and PLWH also have an increased prevalence of oral HPV infection. Disparities by
race/ethnicity exist. Whites have higher incidences of OPC than other racial groups, while people with OPC
categorized as “Black” have worse survival rates than other groups. Disparities also include a later stage of
diagnosis and less frequent cancer-directed treatment for members of ethnic minority groups. There are few
data, however, on racial/ethnic differences in oral HPV infection, persistence of oral HPV infection, or
progression of oral HPV infection to OPC among PLWH. Prospective studies are needed to identify risk
factors, potential biomarkers, novel screening or prevention methods for OPC among PLWH. However, there
are serious feasibility issues in performing prospective studies of oral HPV persistence. Oral HPV infection
is rare, even among sexual minority men (SMM) living with HIV (LWH), who have the highest prevalence of
oral HPV (5% HPV-16, 17% high-risk HPV). A prospective study with the ability to recruit and screen a
race/ethnically diverse cohort would require screening thousands of men to identify the few with oral HPV
infection. This would be costly and burden the participant with multiple clinic visits. A time and cost-saving
alternative would be to conduct most of the screening for eligible study participants by mail. We propose to
conduct a pilot study with 135 racially/ethnically diverse SMM-LWH to evaluate the agreement between at-
home self-collected samples and clinic-collected samples for detecting HR-HPV. Participants will have HPV
DNA sample collection kits sent to them through the USPS. They will be asked to collect one alcohol-based
mouthwash oral rinse and gargle sample and one Foam Swab collected saliva sample applied to an FTA
card and to return the two samples via FedEx refrigerated overnight shipping. A clinic visit will be within 7-
10 days of the home sample collection, and participants will have a similar ORG sample collected in the
research office following gold-standard clinic procedures. We will also assess the feasibility, acceptability,
and comfort of receiving oral HPV DNA sample collection kits in the mail, ease of understanding the
instruction sheet, ease of collecting samples, and ability to package and mail the samples using refrigerated
packaging within 24 hours of collection. The PI will use the pilot data collected through this funding
mechanism for new investigators to design a future prospective cohort study among racially and ethnically
diverse SMM-LWH investigating risk factors and salivary biomarkers for persistent oral HPV and early HPV-
OPC. Her study directly addresses NIDCR’s initiative “Understanding Persistent Oral Human Papillomavirus
and Human Immunodeficiency Virus co-infection and Its Role with Oropharyngeal Cancer Induction.”"

The Reproductive Scientist Development Program (RSDP) is a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional
research career development program for obstetrician-gynecologists in cell and molecular biology and
related fundamental sciences. The objective of this program is to educate obstetrician-gynecologists in
contemporary basic science research related to reproductive medicine and biology in order to prepare
them for research careers in academic medicine. The overall goal is to help ensure that academic
obstetrics and gynecology fulfills its mission to increase research and discovery in the reproductive
sciences. Outstanding MD/PhD, PhD, and MD scientists with broad research experience serve as faculty
mentors.
A unique feature of this program is that outstanding individuals, upon completing a residency in
obstetrics and gynecology, and in most cases two or three years of clinical subspecialty fellowship, spend
two years (Phase I) in fundamental science research laboratories under the supervision and mentorship of
experienced, highly regarded accomplished scientists. During Phase I, Scholars are dedicated to
extensive, immersive training in research methods and research-related career development. Following
this experience, Scholars spend an additional two-year period establishing their research program in a
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (Phase II). Here, the Scholar serves as a junior faculty member
with at least 75% time devoted to developing an independent research career. For the past five (5) years,
salary support for scholars has been provided mainly by NICHD, while support for research-related
expenses has been provided from the various non-federal agencies who contribute to the RSDP program.
The RSDP has a rich history of educating young physician scientists in Obstetrics and Gynecology and
replenishing the pipeline of reproductive scientists and is committed to continuing its objective of
producing the next leaders of our academic obstetrics and gynecology departments. With funding thru
this supplement, the program can address the relative dearth of applicants and scholars in the
subspecialty of gynecologic oncology and help to fill an urgent need for well-trained physician scientists
in this subspecialty."
11017225,"We aim to uncover metabolic and protein signaling pathways contributing to the regional vulnerability of
neocortical pyramidal neurons in Alzheimer’s disease and to identify novel targets for detection and
intervention. We will compare the prefrontal cortex, a neocortical brain area afflicted by neuropathology
early in Alzheimer’s disease, with the primary visual cortex, a brain area that is relatively spared. In the
funded grant, we are using mass spectrometric imaging in combination with segmentation analyses, to
identify spatial changes of small molecules and proteins in postmortem brain sections prepared from
these neocortical areas from donors at various clinical and pathological stages of Alzheimer’s disease
compared to controls. In the proposed supplement, we will apply multiplexed immunofluorescence
imaging on sections from the same specimens, to obtain information on cellular and microenvironment
changes, specifically astrocytic changes, in and around vulnerable neocortical neurons during disease
progression, correlated with the clinical severity, degree and location of neuropathological changes, and
the risk genotype. We will characterize cortical layer-specific changes in astrocytic coverage of blood
vessels, determine how astrocytic cell state and morphology changes in Alzheimer’s disease, and
ascertain how astrocyte heterogeneity correlates spatially to neuronal vulnerability. We will optimize cell
co-culture systems and transcriptional analysis for validation studies. Further, in the parent grant, we will
register the data from both imaging techniques to identify metabolic pathways and protein signaling
changes at the regional, laminar and cellular level and to locate covariation in molecular and cellular
phenotypes contributing to Alzheimer’s disease vulnerability. In addition to generating a comprehensive
dataset of the cellular and molecular changes at various stages of Alzheimer’s disease, these studies will
involve the development, validation, and dissemination of novel tools for analysis of large datasets
generated using two powerful imaging tools, one that detects hundreds of analytes with the possibility of
detecting previously unknown contributors to disease and the other that provides higher resolution with
a select set of known markers. In the long term, the data generated from these studies could provide the
basis for testing novel disease-modifying treatments by cell-type specific targeting of identified metabolic
pathways using experimental models, such as brain organoids to replicate cortical lamination with human
neurons or humanized mouse chimeras to model interactions between neurons and non-neuronal cell
types."
11014819,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Caspases are a group of proteases most well known for their destructive role in apoptosis. While their
activation is often equated with cell death, in skeletal muscles, this does not hold true. For example, during
myogenic differentiation, caspases are activated in a transient, regulated, and reversible manner. These
proteases can also be activated chronically in Duchenne or limb-girdle muscular dystrophies. Nevertheless, very
little is known about the non-apoptotic roles of caspases in muscle formation and degeneration. By focusing on
caspase-mediated trimming of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), this K01 project will elucidate how sublethal
caspases bring about such contrasting outcomes. Caspases can proteolyze four distal subunits of the NPC,
impair nuclear export, and entrap several NES (nuclear export signal)-containing proteins, many of which have
genome regulatory functions. In Aim 1, NES-containing proteins that accumulate in the nucleus during
myogenesis and drive genome reconfiguration will be identified in an unbiased manner. In addition, a focused
study will be conducted to understand how FAK, an NES-containing focal adhesion protein that doubles as a
transcription cofactor in the nucleus, interacts with MBD2, a methyl CpG-binding protein, to de-repress myogenic
genes. In Aim 2, caspase-mediated NPC trimming in dystrophic muscles will be assessed. Given that modest
activation of caspases by ER stressors is sufficient to cause NPC trimming and nuclear export shutdown in
myotubes, the NPC in dystrophic muscles will be similarly modified and dysfunctional. Therefore, a proteome-
wide search will be performed to identify proteins whose nuclear levels are abnormally high in dystrophic
myonuclei and have potential to induce genome dysregulation.
 In short, by dissecting the antagonistic pleiotropy of the caspase-NPC-nuclear export axis, this proposal
aims to provide a foundation for new therapeutic approaches that promote muscular health in both healthy
individuals and muscular dystrophy patients. This research combines the expertise of the Martin Hetzer lab (the
Salk Institute) in the NPC and that of the Lorenzo Puri lab (Sanford-Burnham-Prebys) in muscle biology. Dr.
Cho’s long-term goal is to lead a research group that studies nuclear proteome and proteases in the context of
myogenesis and muscular dystrophies. K01 award will provide him the stability, networking opportunity, and
confidence to develop into a young leader in the field of muscle biology who is proficient in both reductionist and
systems approaches."
11015195,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are common in the United States (SAMHSA, 2022), yet primary care providers
often overlook these conditions in patients seen for routine visits; even when identified, referral to treatment
and appropriate interventions do not always follow (Isaacson and Schorling, 1999). Despite the existence of
effective and evidence-based interventions for addressing AUD, there is an apparent research-practice gap of
these within the primary care setting (Rehm, et al., 2016), with many PCPs reporting low levels of
preparedness to deal with SUDs, including AUD and polysubstance use disorders, although these disorders
have the potential to cause significant and lifelong health impacts (Shapiro and McCance, 2013). Effective
continuing education programs are needed to support providers in implementing the evidence base on AUD
into practice. To address these gaps, Moses/Weitzman Health System and its Weitzman Institute propose the
Translating Research into Practice on Alcohol and Polysubstance Use Disorders by Educating the
Interprofessional Primary Care Team project. The overall goals of this project are to 1) improve the capacity of
primary care medical providers and behavioral health providers in federally qualified health centers and other
safety net primary care settings across the United States to apply best practices derived from the current
science in the prevention, screening, and treatment of AUD and polysubstance use disorder into practice and
2) enhance this audience's interest and engagement in foundational and emerging scientific literature related
to AUD and polysubstance use disorders. The proposed project will develop, implement, and evaluate three
complementary, virtual continuing education strategies: 1) two, 16-session cohorts of Project ECHO Alcohol
Use Disorder, 2) 12, one-hour Science to Practice sessions adapting a virtual journal club module, and 3) nine
on-demand eLearning modules offering self-paced education in 15-30 minute increments. In addition, the
project will convene an Alcohol Use Disorder in Primary Care Advisory Council of 10 representatives including
multidisciplinary leaders and clinicians from the target audience, individuals with lived experience in recovery
from AUD, and experts in AUD research to discuss current best practices, challenges, and solutions to address
AUD and polysubstance use disorder in primary care and inform the project. These efforts are anticipated to
educate 670 providers, improve their knowledge, skills, attitudes, and self-efficacy, and increase their interest
and engagement in the scientific literature. The simultaneous evaluation activities are anticipated to develop
and advance best practices in utilizing the selected virtual education modalities to both achieve and sustain
outcomes and translate the science on AUD and polysubstance use disorders into primary care practice."
11018369,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell division underlies the development of humans from embryos to full-grown adults, regenerative processes
such as wound healing, and diseases such as cancer. While much is known about the intracellular aspects of
mammalian cell division, less is known about the extracellular aspects of cell division. In many physiological
contexts, cells divide in mechanically confining microenvironments, including dense extracellular matrices
(ECMs) and growing tumors. Cell division requires extensive morphological changes, including significant growth
during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and elongation along the mitotic axis during mitosis, or mitotic elongation.
Both growth and mitotic elongation are strictly required for successful cell division. A mechanically confining
microenvironment provides a physical barrier to both cell growth and mitotic elongation, and cells must overcome
this confinement for successful cell division. Our recent studies have shown that single dividing cells in three-
dimensional (3D) matrices generate protrusive forces along the mitotic axis to drive mitotic elongation via a
combination of interpolar spindle elongation and cytokinetic ring contraction. We have also found that cell growth
during the G1 phase is mediated by outward force generation. However, it remains unclear how these forces
and their underlying mechanisms adapt to confining microenvironments with a wide range of stiffness and
viscoelasticity. In this project, we will determine how cells tune extracellular forces to sustain cell division in highly
confining microenvironments, using a powerful combination of rigorous agent-based modeling and experiments
with engineered biomaterials for 3D cell culture. We hypothesize that in microenvironments with increased
confinement, i) protrusive activity increases to make space and activate mechanosensitive channels for driving
G1 phase cell growth via increased osmotic pressure, and ii) enhanced cytokinetic ring contraction drives mitotic
elongation. The main hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following three aims: (1) Determine how mitotic
elongation of isolated cells within highly confining microenvironments is accomplished via a novel force feedback
mechanism; (2) Define how isolated cells achieve G1 phase cell growth in highly confining microenvironments;
and (3) Establish how growth and mitotic elongation of cells in growing spheroids induce overall expansion of
spheroids in highly confining microenvironments. The proposed research project is significant because it will
reveal how cells modulate their force generation, to drive cell growth and mitotic elongation for cell division in
physiologically relevant microenvironments, and also elucidate the role of matrix remodeling and multicellular
cooperation in cell division. The approach is innovative because of i) the development and use of agent-based
models that can rigorously capture the most important aspects of cell growth, mitotic elongation, and confining
microenvironments with complex rheological properties, ii) the focus on extracellular aspects of cell division, iii)
the role of matrix viscoelasticity in cell division, and iv) the examination of the physical basis for spheroid growth."

Regulatory interactions and MedTech business operations. Dr. Zhang will interact with AMI mentors that have
experience in translating their academic skillsets to commercial and R&D activities at a small company.
Public Health Problem: Aging and neurodegenerative disorders are associated with loss of dendritic
complexity, demyelination of axons and reduced neuronal excitability. Optical imaging tools such as fiber
photometry, and implantable GRIN lenses coupled to head mounted microscopes, can be used to image
neuron morphology and activity beyond the depths accessible through multiphoton microscopy. However,
tissue damage caused by their surgical implantation methods can result in similar changes in neural activity
and morphology as seen in aging and cognitive decline, confounding experimental results. Previous studies of
oscillated insertion of needles into the peripheral tissue and electrodes in the central nervous system have
reduced insertion force and tissue damage.
A tool is needed to reliably reduce tissue damage and strain associated with implantation of large diameter
(>100µm) imaging lenses used in optical neuroscience to eliminate the experimental confound and improve
studies of age-related changes in neuron morphology and function.
Value Proposition: This project develops the Optical Neuroscience Insertion Tool (ONIT) to improve insertion
dynamics of GRIN lenses and other optical neuroscience systems. Later work will expand ONIT to insert large
devices, like DBS probes, with less tissue damage, for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in humans.
Aim 1- Optimize, build, and test lightweight ONIT system. (AMI: Months 1-9).
Acceptance Criteria: Construction of a computer controlled ultrasonic actuator capable of 1) grasping and
releasing fiber optic cannula and GRIN lenses with vacuum pressure, 2) Advancing the implant at speeds less
than 100µm/sec, 3) reducing the puncture force of fiber optic cannula (200µm diameter) >60% in an ex vivo
rodent brain tissue model, and 4) monitoring force applied to actuator during insertion.
Aim 2 - Demonstrate improved signal to noise of in vivo measures of neural activity and histological
markers of neuron complexity for six weeks following oscillated insertion of large diameter GRIN
lenses in a rodent model. (Months 9-12; AMI/ PSU).
Acceptance Criteria: Ability to insert large diameter GRIN lenses without the need for tissue aspiration,
reduced attenuation (>50%) of baseline and evoked GCaMP7f signal intensity 6wks following implant.
Reduced histological indicators of neurodegeneration (>50% greater neuron complexity using Sholl analysis)
and scar formation (<50% compared to control GFAP+ area) within 500µm of GRIN lenses implanted with
oscillated insertion.
Commercialization & Marketing: Early sales via third party distributors will be reinvested to continue
development towards a clinically relevant system to insert similarly large DBS electrodes, a market expected to
reach $4.3B by 2030."

 This diversity supplement will provide Ms. Jania Zenon with invaluable mentorship,
training, and advanced research experience via the recently funded recently awarded NIH
grant entitled ""Variations in long-term fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution associations
with mortality by particle size, source, and composition"" (R01ES035468). The research portion
of this supplement aims to expand this research to investigate mortality impacts of PM2.5 air
pollution exposures on mortality from Alzheimer’s disease. PM2.5 has been found to be
associated with serious adverse health implications, including increased risk of mortality.
However, there is a limited understanding with respect to effects on neurodegenerative
disorders. Specifically, while there is evidence of an association between PM2.5 and
Alzheimer’s disease, there is a lack of rigorous research on PM2.5 and Alzheimer’s disease
mortality; and there is even more limited research on the impacts of PM2.5 particle source, size
distribution or composition-specific variations in the PM2.5 mass- Alzheimer’s association. The
parent grant focuses on the linkage between variation in PM2.5 size, composition, source and
cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Cohort. Ms. Zenon
aims to assess these associations with respect to Alzheimer’s disease mortality in this well-
characterized cohort of over 500,000 older aged participants throughout the United States,
who have been followed since 1995-1996 for mortality and cause of death, individual
characteristics of the participants, and census tract ecologic covariates. She will also assess
the potentially effect modifying of an antioxidant rich diet and residence health opportunity
disparities on these associations. This will enable an assessment of the various potential
particulate matter air pollution exposure associations with Alzheimer’s disease mortality, as
well as investigations into potentially modifiable PM2.5 effect varying factors."
11019294,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among women in the United States, and Black
women have higher rates of CVD mortality than White women. Women who experience hypertensive disorders
in pregnancy (HDP), including chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia,
face substantially higher future CVD risk. About one in seven women experience HDP by the end of their
childbearing years, with higher rates among women of color. HDP is an important sex-specific risk-enhancer
for CVD as a history of HDP imparts a similar increase in CVD risk as smoking cigarettes or having a family
history of CVD. Transitioning to primary care postpartum is recommended for all women but has particular
urgency for women with HDP. Primary care is an appropriate setting for short- and long-term CVD risk
management, including identification and treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. However, little is
known about the primary care provided for postpartum women with HDP and whether it responds to their
heightened CVD risk. Prior research has shown substantial disparities in rates of postpartum primary care use
by insurance status and by race/ethnicity, and in the care delivered immediately postpartum, but little is known
about clinical care delivered in postpartum primary care after experiencing HDP for CVD risk management and
whether women of color and publicly insured women receive different care. Our parent grant (NHLBI
R01HL164489-02) uses a mixed methods design to examine the postpartum transition to primary care and the
CVD risk management provided within primary care for women with recent HDP. This administrative
supplement will allow us to enhance our ongoing research with additional detail on intersectional patient-level
factors to examine whether these systems of care disproportionately contribute to disadvantage for women of
color and women with lower incomes. In response to NOT-OD-24-032, we propose to enhance Aim 2 of our
parent grant by using a clinical records database to (2A) examine the association of clinician patient panel
characteristics (minority-serving, Medicaid-serving) and CVD risk management in postpartum primary care,
and (2B) to determine whether associations in 2A vary by individual patient characteristics (race/ethnicity,
insurance type). This proposed supplement addresses how inequities in healthcare may contribute to poor
CVD outcomes for women with multiple marginalized identities. Our research team will include both early
career and independent investigators with appropriate expertise in maternal and women’s health, health
inequities among minoritized groups, and clinical care responsive to heightened CVD risk. The proposed
supplement research is important because as rates of HDP rise nationally and racial disparities in HDP persist,
appropriate management of CVD risk may mitigate impact on future CVD outcomes, including premature
mortality."
11019307,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The opioid epidemic is inextricably intertwined with our nation's criminal justice system. At least 20% of people
with opioid use disorder (OUD) were involved in the criminal justice system, and individuals just released from
jail have an eight times higher risk of drug overdose compared with the general population. Given this risk,
several jails now treat OUD with medications, but these efforts will be ineffective if they fail to connect people
with OUD to care upon release. Housing instability, food insecurity, lack of social support, mistrust in the health
system, and co-morbid physical and mental health conditions threaten a person's ability to engage and remain
in community OUD treatment. Prior work has not identified effective strategies to engage justice-involved
individuals in OUD care that are feasible and honor patients' values, preferences, and needs. Until this
knowledge gap addressed, it will be difficult to reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality in the United
States. The overall objective of this study is to assess whether the Transitions Clinic Network (TCN) program,
which provides enhanced primary care and OUD treatment for people recently released from incarceration,
improves measures in the opioid treatment cascade. In TCN, formerly incarcerated community health workers
are embedded within primary care teams and address social determinants of OUD, provide social support,
help patients build trust in the health system and advocate in interactions with the criminal justice system. The
central hypothesis of Transitions Clinic Network: Post Incarceration Addiction Treatment, Healthcare, and
Social Support (TCN PATHS) study is that TCN program participation improves opioid treatment cascade
measures among those with OUD just released from jails. TCN PATHS (1UG1DA050072-05) is a hybrid type I
effectiveness-implementation trial, the goal of which is to randomize 400 people with OUD just released from 5
local jails (Minneapolis, MN, Bridgeport, CT, Durham, NC, Caguas, PR, and Bronx, NY) to compare the
effectiveness of the TCN intervention versus referral to standard primary care on opioid treatment cascade
outcomes and whether housing, food access, criminal justice contact, and social support mediate this
association. To date, we have recruited 238 participants and are seeking additional funding to finish the study
and evaluate 6-month outcomes on OUD treatment cascade. The administrative supplement will thus preserve
the likelihood for the project to answer TCN PATHS's primary study question, and we will focus recruitment
and retention in only three of the sites but complete participant follow-up in two others. Furthermore, the
supplement will increase the likelihood of supporting independent scientific research careers for two junior
faculty who have received NIH supplements to study how novel factors, including sleep and self-stigma, affect
OUD treatment outcomes."
11016833,"ABSTRACT
 Metabolomics, the comprehensive characterization of small molecules in biological systems is offering
unprecedented insights into biological systems. Facilitated by next-generation mass spectrometry instruments,
metabolomics research has grown rapidly over the past 15 years. However, mass spectrometry is a resource-
intensive analytical approach requiring significant investment in infrastructure, technology, and domain expertise
to produce high quality data. Because of this, most investigators outsource analyses to commercial entities or
collaborators at other institutions. As a result, the metabolomic needs of researchers far outstrip the availability
of facilities that can offer analytical, educational and training opportunities. Outsourcing also results in elevated
costs, a lack of methodological transparency and standardization, major restrictions on available approaches,
missed training opportunities, and an inability to innovate and accelerate discovery. Therefore, in 2021 we
established the Quantitative Metabolite Analysis Center (QMAC) at the University of California San Francisco
(UCSF). We fund raised to support purchase of five mass spectrometers and hire a small team of domain experts
to facilitate metabolomics research and training needs of a broad range of intramural and extramural
investigators. However, currently QMAC instruments and personnel are decentralized across multiple locations
at UCSF. In several cases, instruments sit in outdated laboratory spaces not designed to house mass
spectrometers. This results in significant workflow inefficiencies and substantially reduces the number of
research studies and trainees that can be served. Thus, we propose to renovate 3,100 square feet of shell
space at the UCSF PH campus to centralize and modernize the Quantitative Metabolomics Analysis
Center to meet the growing need for metabolomics research, development, education, embedded
training and workforce development. The proposed centralized QMAC will offer study design guidance,
sample processing, data generation and analytic support. It will continue to make newly developed mass
spectrometry analytical tools available to the broader research community. The proposed center will offer
education and embedded training opportunities and hands-on instrument time to accelerate new tool
development. We propose a design that enhances indoor workspace conditions, pays attention to issues of
energy efficiency and green chemistry and prioritizes research, education, training, and integration with other
research facilities across UCSF and beyond."
11019179,"Transgender women (TGW), particularly young TGW (ages 18-29), are among the fastest growing HIV+
populations worldwide, with HIV prevalence rates of 15-28%. Thailand has the highest adult HIV
seroprevalence in Asia, with high rates of HIV infection among TGW (18%). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is
an efficacious HIV prevention strategy recommended for all persons at substantial risk for HIV. PrEP is highly
effective when taken as prescribed, but uptake and adherence have been low, particularly among TGW. Key
barriers include stigma related to gender identity, limited employment, and high-risk behaviors (e.g., sex work,
substance use). TGW experience intersectional stigma that may have a synergistic influence on engagement in
HIV prevention, including PrEP use and HIV testing. To address these challenges, we propose to develop and
pilot a mHealth intervention to overcome stigma and promote use of PrEP. We will adapt the 4-session,
Healthy Choices (HC) intervention for mHealth (mHC) to increase access and delivery of HC in our target
population. We will also culturally translate select modules of the FRESH intervention into a client focused,
digitized abbreviate package to address HIV, trans-, and intersectional stigmas that harm TGW, drawing on
our successful protocols tested in prior projects. Intervention development will be guided by ADAPT-ITT and
informed by two conceptual models. These intervention components will be integrated to enhance the impact
of mHC through FRESH content and will be delivered via an innovative intervention platform. Our primary
aim is to develop mHC and FRESH content and assess their preliminary efficacy. We will use a Multiphase
Optimization Strategy (MOST) to identify the most effective intervention component or combination of
components to address intersectional stigma and PrEP use in this population. The proposed study will have 3
phases. Phase I includes focus groups with Thai young TGW and healthcare providers to explore intersectional
stigma, and barriers and facilitators of the use of HIV prevention services through thematic analysis to inform
intervention adaptation. Phase II consists of adapting and beta testing mHC and FRESH content, leveraging a
community advisory board. In Phase III, we will conduct a MOST design-based trial to assess feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of intervention components (mHC and FEESH content). One hundred
and eight TGW will be randomized to one of four experimental conditions: (1) Standard PrEP Counseling (SPC,
control), (2) mHC + SPC, (3) FRESH content + SPC, and (4) mHC + FRESH content + SPC. Feasibility and
acceptability of the intervention will be assessed through intervention engagement data and the System
Usability Scale. Preliminary outcomes will be assessed by evaluating stigma reduction, PrEP use, and HIV
testing. TGW will complete assessments at baseline and at 3- and 6-months post-intervention. Upon R34
completion, we will have a highly innovative mHealth intervention designed specifically to address HIV and
related stigmas to promote PrEP use in Thai TGW which will be ready for efficacy trial testing."

Accurate cell division is essential for the development of all organisms. During each cell cycle, chromosomes
must be precisely partitioned to daughter cells. Defects in chromosome partitioning generate aneuploidy, the
state where entire chromosomes are gained or loss. Aneuploidy is a the most common chromosomal abnormality
in cancer cells and is thought to be a major factor in the evolution of cancer. It is also the leading cause of
miscarriages and hereditary birth defects in humans. The proposed work will lead to an understanding of the
mechanisms that ensure accurate chromosome partitioning. This work is important for maintaining genomic
stability and preventing human disease. Chromosome partitioning occurs when spindle microtubules move
chromosomes by interacting with kinetochores, the machines that assemble onto the chromosome at a locus
called the centromere. Kinetochores carry out a number of functions, such as maintaining load-bearing
attachments to the ends of microtubules that are continually growing and shrinking. They also control the cell
cycle when there is a defect in kinetochore attachments to microtubules. Our lab will address two fundamental
questions about chromosome segregation using in vitro assays: 1) How is kinetochore assembly regulated? 2)
How do kinetochore proteins contribute to force-dependent kinetochore-microtubule attachments? We will use
budding yeast for these studies because they are amenable to biochemical, genetic and cytological studies, and
the yeast kinetochore is the best characterized to date. Taken together, our work will lead toward an
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome partitioning in all eukaryotes."

Talaromycosis is caused by the dimorphic fungus Talaromyces marneffei (Tm) endemic in Southeast Asia where
it is a leading the cause of death among patients with advanced HIV disease with a mortality on treatment of
30%. Treatment options are limited to just two drugs: amphotericin B deoxycholate (DAmB) which has substantial
toxicity and itraconazole which has poor bioavailability. Our research team has recently delivered the landmark
IVAP trial demonstrating the superiority of DAmB over itraconazole in survival and rate of fungal clearance,
propelling DAmB as the first-line therapy in 2019. Although highly potent, DAmB infusion over 14 days is
associated with serious toxicity; hence the drug has largely been abandoned in high-income countries. As a
roadmap to identify safer and more effective antifungal strategies, our proposal applies three major advances
made in AIDS-associated mycoses to accelerate treatment for talaromycosis. First, clinical trials in
cryptococcosis show that shorter (5-7 days) courses of DAmB is as effective but less toxic than the standard 14-
day course. Second, the AMBITION trial has shown that a single 10 mg/kg dose of liposomal amphotericin B
(LAmB) is as effective as 7-14 days of DAmB but has 30% less toxicity, leading to rapid endorsement by the
WHO as the first-line therapy for cryptococcal meningitis in 2022. Third, addition of flucytosine (5FC) to DAmB
has been shown to be safe, improves fungal clearance and survival. These advances in cryptococcosis lead us
to hypothesize that 1) a single 10mg/kg dose of LAmB will be superior to 14 days of DAmB and 2) the addition
of 5FC will be superior to DAmB or LAmB alone in Tm complication free survival. We will build on our experience
in leading the five-center IVAP trial in Vietnam to conduct a factorial, partially placebo-controlled trial to test two
hypotheses within one LAmB-FAST trial, thus cutting time to knowledge and cost by half. We propose three
related but independent specific aims:
AIM 1. Determine if a single 10mg/kg dose of LAmB is superior to 14 days of DAmB in Tm complication-free
survival. AIM 2. Determine if combination therapy with 5FC is superior to DAmB or LAmB alone in Tm
complication-free survival. The primary outcome for both aims 1 and 2 is hazard of a composite of death, Tm
complications, and AEs grade 3 or higher. Secondary outcomes include: 1) All-cause mortality; 2) Fungal
clearance rate over first 14 days; 3) A novel 4-scale hierarchical outcome of i. Mortality, ii. Tm complications, iii.
AE grade 3, iv. Quality of life scores; 3) Rates of Tm DNA and Tm antigen decline over first 12 weeks. In AIM 3,
we will leverage rare access to a well-characterized and treated talaromycosis cohort to conduct a follow-on
nested randomized controlled sub-study testing whether a HIV viral load guided strategy of stopping itraconazole
chemoprophylaxis (STOP SHORT) is non-inferior the current CD4 guided strategy in the prevention of
talaromycosis relapse and death.
Impact statement. The results of this trial are likely to change treatment guidelines for talaromycosis."
11007654,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibody disease (MOGAD) is a rare disease characterized as a
neurological, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system. The symptoms of MOGAD
include vision loss, symptoms associated with damage to the spinal cord, as well as seizures. While the current
standard of care against MOGAD includes steroids and immunosuppressants, they are associated with systemic
immunosuppression with complications and frequent debilitating relapses. Thus, there is an urgent need for new
targeted treatment options for MOGAD patients. As MOG is the sole target antigen in MOGAD patients, MOG is
an attractive target. Here, we propose to develop a novel nanoparticle platform for the treatment of MOGAD.
Toward this goal, we have developed synthetic high-density lipoprotein NanoDiscs for efficient delivery of antigen
peptides to lymph nodes. Our preliminary data shows that NanoDiscs induce robust antigen-specific immune
tolerance and disease modification in murine models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and
another autoimmune disorder, type 1 diabetes (T1D). Based on our compelling proof-of-concept data, here we
propose to further develop NanoDiscs for the treatment of MOGAD."

 Persons of all ages with certain metabolic disorders are at-risk for metabolic crises when a certain
metabolite accumulates in the blood. While this metabolite can be measured in a clinical laboratory, currently
there is no home-based device to monitor the metabolite that causes the metabolic crises.
 Patients, their caregivers, and the doctors who specialize in these metabolic disorders strongly believe
that a home measurement device would enable significantly improved metabolite control and health
outcomes. Through work in Phase II awards from the National Institutes of Health (R44HD107897) and the
National Science Foundation (2111884), the company has developed demonstrably excellent technology that
enables accurate measurement of the metabolite in a single drop of blood.
 This proposal is submitted as a Commercialization Readiness Pilot to perform late stage development
and commercialization activities needed to overcome key software development, hardware manufacturing,
and regulatory challenges necessary to bring the at home product to market."

The goal of Phase I is to adapt DeNovX’s surface science approach to improving crystallization to challenges
in specimen preparation for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) that limit throughput and diminish
resolution. CryoEM is superior for studies of noncrystalline biological analytes including proteins, complexes,
and assemblies. Ideal cryoEM specimens require the bioanalyte to be evenly distributed and randomly oriented
in vitrified aqueous media on a support. Specimen preparation comprises the deposition of aqueous bioanalyte
on a support “grid”, thinning via blotting, and vitrification. Specimen quality is adversely affected by: (1) support
hydrophobicity, (2) partitioning of bioanalytes to the support film surfaces, (3) partitioning of bioanalytes to the
air-water interface, and (4) orientation bias. DeNovX and Vanderbilt will expand their ongoing collaboration to
create innovative products using physicochemical surface modifications to tune the surface energy,
hydrophilicity, H-bonding, and interfacial surface charge properties of cryoEM supports to create
thermodynamically favorable domains that enhance bioanalyte incorporation while minimizing partitioning and
orientation bias. Improved cryoEM workflows and specimen quality will benefit Public Health through a better
structure-function understanding of diseases and potential therapies. Specific Aim 1 - Identify physical and
chemical modifications to Au- and C-based cryoEM specimen supports that enhance aqueous sample
adsorption across holes using replicate, controlled tensiometry and microscopy studies. Candidate physical
modifications for holey supports and continuous films (graphene/graphene oxide) include surface energy
tuning; texturing; etc.; and chemical modifications include plasma treatment; randomly anchored (covalent or
noncovalent) combinations of polyethylene oxide (PEO), polypropylene oxide (PPO), PEO/PPO copolymers;
hydroxyl-, alkyl-, or ionizable termini; etc. Confirm that the modified surfaces are comparably wettable (± 3𝜎) to
control supports using solution conditions for benchmark cryoEM bioanalytes (e.g., ferritin, E. coli ribosomes,
etc.). Rank and advance the top six physicochemical surface modifications showing increases of ≥ 10% in
hydrophilicity/surface energy or bioanalyte adsorption across support holes. Specific Aim 2 - Produce Au- and
C-based cryoEM specimen supports using the most promising physicochemical modifications from Aim 1 and
conduct controlled, replicate studies (n ≥ 3) of the benchmark bioanalytes using cryoEM to demonstrate that
surface modification does not decrease the S/N of vitrified specimens by ≥ 5% and that particle incorporation to
holes is improved by ≥ 10% or that useful particle losses to support film or air-water partitioning are reduced by
≥ 5% relative to controls. Random particle orientations will be qualitatively assessed for challenge bioanalytes
(e.g., the flagellar rotor, Krebs cycle enzymes, etc.) to confirm that orientation bias is not exacerbated . It is
anticipated that more randomly oriented particles will be incorporated into cryoEM grids, and Phase II plans
include maturing prototypes through technology demonstrations."

The nuclear entry and transport of HIV-1 to genes for viral (v)DNA integration is determined by viral capsid and
its interaction with the host cellular polyadenylation specific factor CPSF61-3. In the absence of CPSF6
interactions, HIV-1 remains tethered to nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and integrates outside of genes in lamin
associated genomic domains or LADs3, 4. We have made a seminal discovery2 that CPSF6 interactions drive
HIV-1 replication complexes to accumulate in phase-separated membraneless compartments called nuclear
speckles, in multiple cell-types including primary CD4+ T-cells and macrophages. Notably, nuclear speckles are
formed at sites of transcription and are known to sequester actively transcribing genes5. As such our finding
indicated that the speckle associated genomic domains or SPADs are the primary targets for HIV-1 vDNA
integration. The scientific premise of this proposal is to delineate the mechanisms of how? HIV-1 navigates the
nucleoplasm to reach speckles and integrate into SPADs, a key step in viral replication that remains under-
explored and poorly understood. We hypothesize that the intrinsically disordered low-complexity regions (LCRs)6
and mixed charged RSLD-domains of CPSF6 cooperatively recruit host-factors including nuclear filaments to
capsids for its release into- and transport to nuclear speckle compartments for integration. We will use novel
technologies developed in our lab and, (1) Determine a role for CPSF6-RSLD domain phase-separation in
releasing HIV-1 from NPCs, and in recruiting new host-proteins including speckles for virus nuclear transport,
(2) apply live-cell imaging to visualize HIV-1 nuclear co-trafficking with CPSF6, nuclear actin and nuclear
speckles and determine the contribution of individual CPSF6 LCRs and RSLD domains to this process, and (3)
determine the role of nuclear speckles, and proximal genomic architecture in biasing vDNA integration into
genes. We expect these studies to provide key mechanistic insights into CPSF6-capsid interactions that mediate
nuclear HIV-1 trafficking to integration sites, identify novel SPADs that respond to virus infection and highlight its
implication on global genome architecture, including virus-cell biology."
11009257,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite significant progress made in preventing perinatal mother-to-child-transmission of HIV, 2022 saw about
130,000 new HIV infections in children globally, a vulnerable group that also accounts for 13% of AIDS-related
deaths. Postnatal infection through breastfeeding remains a significant contributing factor for mother-to-child
transmission of HIV, and often derives from untreated/undiagnosed mothers living with HIV or poor adherence
to antiretrovirals (ARVs). Currently available prophylaxis options for newborns with the potential for perinatal
exposure to HIV is ARV therapy. However, ARV formulations (oral and injectable) and regimens meant for
pediatric use are limited, difficult to adhere to, and potentially accompanied by multiple undesirable side effects.
Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), currently under investigation in clinical trials, represent an innovative
and safer way to deliver perinatal HIV prophylaxis by directly engaging and reinforcing host immunity. Despite
the promise, these highly potent Abs have demonstrated in adults and children, in their current form, they often
require multiple injections and cold chain storage and transportation, which is burdensome to health care
systems and a considerable expense in low-resource settings. A user-friendly transdermal microneedle (MN)
patch containing thermally stabilized bnAbs would circumvent these problems through the safe and easy delivery
of these potent Abs for protection against HIV-1, even outside of a clinic setting. The MN patch design proposed
here is aimed to accomplish co-delivery of a cocktail of long-acting bnAbs offering long-lasting protection without
the burden of frequent and adverse-effect laden pediatric ARV formulations or potentially painful and
cumbersome antibody infusions for newborns. In this proposal, we will test this innovative delivery platform for
the co-delivery of three different bnAbs currently in advanced clinical development (VRC07-523LS,
PDGM1400LS and PGT-121LS). Rigorous design and fabrication of MN patches with in vitro and ex vivo
characterization of formulated bnAbs will precede their in vivo preclinical assessment of safety in young rabbits,
pharmacokinetics (PK) in rats, and subsequent testing in neonate Rhesus macaques to characterize the PK
profile and efficacy against oral challenges with SHIVSF162P3. Together, these findings will inform the
characteristics and viability of an innovative bnAb delivery platform that could significantly curtail the persistent
health crisis of pediatric HIV infections."

Substance use disorders have a devastating impact on individuals, families, and society. Present
pharmacological treatments do not fully ameliorate patients’ symptoms and in many cases are unable to treat
the full spectrum of symptoms. Therefore, it is paramount to identify new targets for pharmacological
intervention. To do this we must better understand the neural mechanisms underpinning drug-mediated
reward, persistent drug-taking and relapse behavior.
The Neuropeptide S (NPS) receptor when activated in rats facilitates reward-related behaviors (e.g. cocaine
seeking). Paradoxically, NPS receptor activation is also anxiolytic-like. As part of our drug discovery efforts, a
NPS receptor targeted molecule was found that retains the anxiolytic-like properties but reduces cocaine
seeking behaviors. In regard to opioids, the levels of NPS receptor changes in rats that have been made
dependent on morphine, and levels of the receptor further change after withdrawal. Therefore, the data
suggest that the NPS-system may be a prime target for addressing the unmet therapeutic need of substance
use disorders. To understand the mechanism by which NPS receptor targeted molecules produce their effects,
the fundamental circuit pathway and behavioral analyses need to be completed.
The goals of this project are proof of concept that NPS receptor targeted molecules can mitigate opioid
seeking. And, whether these same molecules can 1) reduce oxycodone taking and 2) reduce the motivation to
obtain oxycodone. Ultimately, knowledge gained through these experiments will allow for the determination of
the therapeutic potential of the NPS receptor as a target for mitigating substance use disorders."

The general goal of the proposed research is to define the mechanistic underpinning for the synthetic lethality
network between a deficiency in homologous recombination (HR) and defects in single-strand annealing
(RAD52) or POLq-mediated end-joining (TMEJ). Exciting preliminary data revealed that BRCA2 and RAD52
delay the repair of S-phase-associated DNA double-stranded breaks (DSB) by TMEJ until M-phase. While the
parent award focuses on BRCA2, this supplement application focuses on RAD52. Our results will have potential
translational implications for the clinical application of newly developed RAD52 and POLq inhibitors for the
treatment of HR-deficient tumors with respect to application protocols, patient selection, and use of DNA damage
response checkpoint inhibitors as well as the response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition.
The Specific Aims are:
1. Define the mechanism of action of BRCA2 in DSB repair pathway control. We will test the model that the
 DNA binding properties of BRCA2 are critical for TMEJ inhibition. In Aim 1A, we conduct foundational studies
 to determine the fundamental DNA binding properties of full-length BRCA2. In Aim 1B, we will define which
 domains of BRCA2 are required for TMEJ inhibition in cells. This combination of cell-based and biochemical
 studies will define the functions and regions of BRCA2 that are required for TMEJ inhibition.
2. Define the mechanism of TMEJ inhibition by BRCA2 and RAD52. BRCA2 and RAD52 employ two different
 modes to inhibit the DNA polymerase activity of POLq which may affect additional reaction steps in the TMEJ
 process. We will reconstitute TMEJ in vitro with purified proteins to determine the mechanisms by which
 BRCA2 (Aim 2A) and RAD52 (Aim 2B) inhibit TMEJ. We will test inhibition of the overall TMEJ reaction and
 individual steps including 1) DNA binding, 2) end-alignment, and 3) DNA synthesis. Analysis of wild type and
 catalytic mutants of POLq will be conducted in vitro and in cells.
3. Define which HR defects are susceptible to RAD52 loss of function. It is an open question whether loss
 of RAD52 will lead to POLq-mediated chromosome fusions and lethality in all HR-deficient backgrounds (Aim
 3A) or all BRCA2 mutants (Aim 3B). Our preliminary studies suggest a model that loading of BRCA2 is the
 critical step to limit TMEJ to M-phase and that HR defects past this step are not affected by RAD52 inhibition.
4. Impact of a RAD52 variant on DSB repair. This supplement application adds this additional Specific Aim
 focused on RAD52 and the functional impact of a variant that is common in Latinos and appears to modify
 risk in BRCA1/2 carriers."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) imposes a substantial burden on millions of individuals in the
United States, both in terms of health and economic costs. Individuals with COPD frequently exhibit
compromised respiratory muscle strength and endurance, significantly impacting everyday physical activities
and overall quality of life. Additionally, the pervasive challenge of non-adherence to prescribed therapies poses
a threat to clinical outcomes and carries significant economic implications. While respiratory muscle strength
training (RMT) is a rehabilitation treatment that has shown efficacy in enhancing breathing function, existing
respiratory strength training devices fall short due to a lack of essential features, among them adherence
monitoring. This lack of features not only impedes effective treatment but can also necessitate the acquisition
of multiple devices to fulfill patient clinical objectives, a circumstance that often becomes cost-prohibitive. This
Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal aims to develop the RMT Complete, a leading-edge
respiratory muscle training device and mobile application developed by Novis Products, LLC. Designed as an
all-in-one solution, the RMT Complete aims to enhance breathing function and quality of life for COPD patients.
RMT Complete distinguishes itself by combining a suite of features not available in other devices such as an
integrated manometer, a wide resistance training range, real-time visual biofeedback, and data recording
capabilities for progress and adherence monitoring. The project's foundation rests on prior work, including
customer discovery interviews, securing SEED funding from the University of Florida for prototype development,
and regulatory consultation with the FDA. The proposed Phase I of this STTR project aligns with the National
Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's (NHLBI) focus on respiratory diseases, particularly COPD, and with the Notice
of Special Interest NOT-OD-21-00: Improving Patient Adherence to Treatment and Prevention Regimens to
Promote Health. The primary goal of this project is to assess the usability of the RMT Complete through
quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. Specific aims include quantifying usability, evaluating
user perception, and the implementation of device and mobile application enhancements guided by usability
data. Successful completion of Phase I will yield an optimized RMT device and application, laying the groundwork
for Phase II clinical trials, where the efficacy of the RMT Complete in respiratory muscle strength training and
adherence tracking will be rigorously tested. This project represents a crucial step toward addressing the unmet
needs of COPD patients, offering an affordable, all-in-one, and user-friendly solution to enhance respiratory
function and improve overall well-being."

Cesarean sections are the most common surgery in the world. In the US alone, 3,000 are performed each day.
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) remains the leading cause of preventable maternal mortality worldwide,
accounting for 27% of the 295,000 maternal deaths worldwide, and 11% of maternal deaths in the United
States. PPH is also the leading cause of severe maternal morbidity, resulting in both short and long-term
consequences to a new mother’s physical and psychological health. Despite efforts at reduction, the rates of
PPH increased by 13% in the US between 2010 and 2014 with atony-related hemorrhage, when the uterus
fails to contract after birth, accounting for 80% of cases. The vast majority of these cases are deemed
preventable. In the US, data shows that black women have significantly higher rates of severe mortality and
morbidity associated with PPH – contributing to a widening health disparity. Compared to vaginal birth,
women undergoing cesarean delivery incur the highest risk of PPH, hemorrhage-related morbidity, and cost to
the healthcare system. Prophylactic administration of oxytocin has been shown to reduce the incidence of PPH
by 50- 60%, however, there are not clear recommendations for oxytocin dosing regimens and the most
appropriate approach to prophylactic dosing at CD continues to be actively investigated as larger doses may
be required but there can be significant hemodynamic changes after IV boluses of oxytocin. Adverse effects
such as ST segment depression, hypotension and tachycardia are well recognized, and have been implicated
as a contributory cause of maternal death. Also, studies have demonstrated that prolonged use of oxytocin
during induction of labor or augmentation can decrease the effectiveness of this measure. When AMTSL
measures fail to control bleeding, therapeutic options include administration of additional uterotonics, uterine
balloon tamponade, invasive uterine artery embolization, uterine compression sutures, and hysterectomy are
employed. Recently, a multi-center randomized control trial using tranexamic acid failed to demonstrate
significance in preventing postpartum hemorrhage in 11,000 patients. A novel method to treat PPH utilizing
vacuum induced uterine tamponade has emerged as an effective therapy. We have developed a novel system
that is specifically designed to tackle the numerous challenges of limiting blood loss, improving visualization,
restoring and maintaining uterine tone and quantifying blood loss in cesarean sections. The aim of this Phase
1 is to finalize design parameters, materials validation, and functional performance testing. A successful
Phase 1 will lead to the execution of an early feasibility trial."

Nicotine addiction is a persistent public health challenge, and smoking remains the leading cause of
preventable disease and death in the United States. As of 2021, an estimated 46 million Americans smoke
tobacco products or use e-cigarettes. This behavior imposes a financial burden of over $600 billion annually,
including nearly $240 billion for direct medical care and almost $180 billion in lost productivity due to illness
and premature death. While approximately 70% of those with nicotine dependence express a desire to quit,
only one in ten successfully achieve nicotine abstinence for 12 months or more through Nicotine Replacement
Therapy (NRT) and non-nicotine medications for smoking cessation. This low success rate highlights the
urgent need for an innovative approach that goes beyond relieving nicotine cravings. Smoking and vaping are
complex behaviors deeply ingrained through long-term conditioning. Quitting involves not only ending nicotine
use but also navigating social settings, managing isolation from social networks, and coping with habitual oral
fixations.
To address this unmet need, we are developing a treatment based on the smoking cessation drug candidate,
cytisine, to be self-administered in vape form using an e-cigarette or ""vape pen."" We propose that this
approach would serve as an effective secondary line of therapy for individuals seeking e-cigarette and smoking
cessation, particularly those who have experienced two or more unsuccessful attempts with existing NRT. It
would allow them to engage in many smoking-related behaviors while simultaneously reducing their nicotine
dependence. While the oral administration of cytisine for smoking cessation is well-established, our innovation
lies in exploring the feasibility of delivering cytisine in vape form. The primary hypothesis of this Phase I grant
is that delivering cytisine through Electronic Vape Administration (EVA) will sufficiently stabilize dopamine
release in the brain, specifically the ventral striatum, thereby reducing nicotine self-administration in a mouse
model of nicotine addiction. To test this hypothesis, we will, 1) determine the pharmacokinetics of cytisine by
quantifying plasma cytisine concentrations after both oral and vape administration in a rodent model, 2) utilize
a biosensor platform, dLight1.3b, to monitor core dopamine levels in vivo during nicotine self-administration,
and 3) evaluate the potential abuse liability of EVA cytisine in e-Vape self-administration (EVSA) and assess
the ability of EVA cytisine to reduce nicotine reinforcement using trained and nicotine-conditioned mice in a
nicotine EVSA paradigm. This proposal provides the foundation for developing an e-cigarette vaping and
smoking cessation product that offers a superior method of treatment tailored for patients who have not been
successful with traditional NRT and oral administration treatments. Our team is uniquely positioned to achieve
this aim. SpaceRx has extensive experience in smoking cessation drugs and prodrugs, and the Henderson
laboratory specializes in the neuropharmacology of nicotine addiction."

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer with limited therapeutic options. Targeted cancer
therapeutics, such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), are a promising new therapeutic class that has
recently overcome this limitation with the approval of mirvetuximab soravtansine. ADCs provide targeted
delivery of cytotoxic payloads by conjugating them to antibodies directed against tumor-selective targets.
Potential clinical benefits of ADCs, however, is limited as they are dependent on target expression.
Mirvetuximab soravtansine is currently restricted to an ovarian cancer patient sub-population that expresses
high levels of the ADC target, FOLR1, which is estimated to be less than 30% of all ovarian cancer cases.
Novel targets and ADC therapeutics are therefore required to increase clinical responses and expand
treatment options to a broader patient population. Using our proprietary IMPACT tumor microenvironment
platform, we have identified a novel tumor-selective target that is overexpressed in ovarian cancer with a
known immunosuppressive role. These characteristics suggest that this target is an intriguing ADC target as
there may be an added benefit of blocking its immunosuppressive function. In pursuit of this potential, we
completed a rigorous antibody campaign that resulted in a fully human lead antibody against this target that
retains the necessary characteristics for ADC development. ADCs generated with our lead antibody and two
different clinically validated payloads demonstrated remarkable tumor control in an in vivo proof-of-concept
study and was superior to that of the standard-of-care chemotherapeutic, carboplatin. The purpose of the
current proposal is to facilitate development our ADC by refining the ovarian cancer target population and
determine the optimal payload and preclinical dose. Completion of this Phase 1 SBIR proposal will support our
goal of advancing this ADC program to IND-enabling studies, with the eventual goal of clinical testing for the
treatment of ovarian cancer."
11008939,"Project Summary: Acromegaly is a chronic, rare endocrine disorder that affects approximately 21,000 adults in
the US that is most often caused by a non-cancerous pituitary tumor that secrets excess growth hormone. Left
untreated, chronic overproduction of growth hormone and subsequent stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-1
in other tissues shortens the the average life expectancy by 10 years from diagnosis. The disease is associated
with 2- to 3-fold increased mortality and serious health complications and comorbidities. These include
cardiovascular disease, respiratory disorders, and metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and impaired lipid
metabolism. The broad consensus is that effective treatment is achieved by strict growth hormone control,
demonstrated by the beneficial effects on comorbidities and mortality. When surgery either fails to completely
remove the pituitary adenoma or is not an option, medical therapy is required for long-term hormone control.
However, control is achieved in only half of patients by the existing therapies. There is a clear unmet medical
need for a therapy that achieves long-term hormone control consistently across the acromegaly patient
population. Elixera’s goal is to develop a novel therapeutic as a first-in-class treatment of acromegaly that fulfills
this unmet medical need. In Phase 1 of this grant, we identified a novel antibody therapeutic that was highly
potent in blocking growth hormone activity. The aim of the Phase 2 grant is to prepare the therapeutic candidate
for manufacture and preclinical toxicology studies and begin clinical trial testing in acromegaly patients."
11008144,"Rates of homelessness among youth and young adults living in the United States have more than doubled in
the last decade, and LGBTQ youth face a higher level of housing insecurity and an increased risk of
homelessness compared with their non-LGBTQ peers. Stigma and discrimination based on sexual orientation
or gender/identity expression contribute to the heightened levels of homelessness experienced by LGBTQ youth.
Housing instability among LGBTQ youth can worsen existing risk factors for HIV and give rise to new
environments that pose additional risks, including survival sex, physical and/or sexual abuse, and injection drug
use. To add to this, unstable housing may challenge already suboptimal access to and engagement with
healthcare services, including HIV prevention and treatment. Existing guidelines and strategic plans in the United
States emphasize the importance of safe and affordable housing to HIV service utilization and outcomes, but
innovative strategies that operate within the existing policy environment and effectively cater to the distinctive
needs of young people are largely unavailable and understudied. While cash transfers are not novel among the
array of existing social safety net interventions, their effective implementation has faced obstacles such as
administrative complexities, conditions linked to work or behavior change, and a lack of adaptability to evolving
needs. To address these complexities, we will first document the existing policy environment that influences
housing and HIV, and second partner with Point Source Youth (PSY), an advocacy leader in the youth
homelessness space, to refine and measure the implementation of monthly, unconditional cash disbursements
to young LGBTQ people at or about to enter the homelessness system in Baltimore City. 60 young people will
be provided with $25,000 each over two years to sustainably exit homelessness, find housing in alignment with
apartment share arrangements, and more easily access HIV services. To guide this research, we will use two
implementation science frameworks in conjunction: the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) 2.0 and Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM). The proposed
strategy is grounded in insights from community-identified needs and barriers, consideration of implementation
challenges at the individual and organizational levels, and an understanding of the ongoing evolution of the policy
context. The specific aims of this study are as follows:
Specific Aim 1 – Map existing municipal, state, and federal laws and policies that impact housing and HIV
among young people and generate a policy index to quantify their breadth and depth, 2020-2025

 The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) block a single immuno-suppressive pathway in cancer patients.
However, across all cancers, less than 30% of patients respond to ICI therapies, due to additional brakes on
the immune system, which limit efficacy. The immuno-suppressive cytokine, TGF− is one of those “brakes”
that drives checkpoint resistance in multiple solid tumors such as colorectal, bladder, prostate, head and neck
cancers and melanoma. Levels of TGF− increase as the cancer becomes more aggressive, driving a worse
patient prognosis. In addition to maintaining tissue health and homeostasis, TGF− is a validated tumor
promoting cytokine with has multiple roles in cancer development, including immune suppression, increasing
angiogenesis and driving metastasis. Despite long standing interest in TGF− blockade as a cancer therapy,
clinical development has been hampered for two main reasons: 1) significant host (i.e., cardiac) toxicity and 2)
the potential to convert indolent early stage tumors into more aggressive ones. However, in preclinical studies,
blockade of the TGF− pathway only in T cells is sufficient for tumor clearance in vivo. Thus, a therapy that
eliminates TGF− signaling solely in immune cells would drive tumor clearance, while avoiding the adverse
events demonstrated by systemic TGF− therapies. With both a Phase I SBIR grant and venture funding, we
have generated SYN101, a proprietary immune cell targeted TGF- therapeutic (SYN101) that selectively
reverses TGF- mediated immune suppression, while sparing host tissue toxicity. We have demonstrated that
monotherapy SYN101 drives tumor clearance and survival in syngeneic mouse tumor models, with
corresponding immune cell activation markers in the blood and tumor microenvironment. Moreover, SYN101
does not cause cardiac toxicity at efficacious doses in vivo. In this Phase II SBIR application, we will perform
additional in vivo efficacy, safety and PK studies with our SYN101 development candidate, which will lead to
IND enabling studies. In Aim 1, we will test efficacy of human SYN101 in humanized mouse tumor models,
along with corresponding lymphocyte PD markers in the blood and tumor microenvironment. Using CyTOF
analysis, we will define the comprehensive immune response driven by SN101 in vivo, as a step towards
identifying biomarkers of TGF- target engagement in clinical trials. In Aim 2, we will test the safety and toxicity
of SYN101 in Sprague Dawley rats, the industry standard for systemic TGF- inhibitor toxicity. In addition, we
will perform PK studies, to round out the full preclinical data package. While we do not anticipate significant
toxicity from SYN101, these studies will derisk the platform, establish efficacy and safety, and support entry
into IND enabling. Virtually every advanced tumor has elevated TGF− levels, such that a safer, more
efficacious targeted TGF- therapy would be beneficial for a significant portion of cancer patients. SYN101 will
provide new therapeutic options for refractory cancer patients and will safely reverse immune suppression to
improve patient response rates."
11008739,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The HIV reservoir is a population of latently HIV infected cells that persists in people living with HIV on
suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevents cure of HIV. Dr. Reeves and colleagues will study the
mechanisms that create and sustain the HIV reservoir throughout treated and untreated infection.
This team will use a mathematical modeling approach to integrate existing published and unpublished as well
as novel experimental data ranging across five stages of infection: early and chronic untreated (Aim 1) and early
and long-term treated, and analytical treatment interruption (Aim 2). Data will consist of HIV viral loads and
genetic sequences (RNA and DNA), cell counts (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells), and clonality of CD4+ T cells defined
by T cell receptor sequencing. We will adopt a novel within-host phylodynamic “wiphy” model to specifically study
HIV reservoir biology by specifically interrogating the various mechanisms driving its persistence vs. clearance
– including cellular proliferation of infected cells and adaptive immune selection against certain HIV sequences.
We will determine which mechanisms predominate in which stages, and provide a comprehensive understanding
of HIV reservoir creation, maintenance, and evolution throughout all infection stages.
This research will aid in the building of next-generation models of HIV reservoir seeding and persistence
dynamics. This work will help the HIV cure field gain a deeper understanding of how the HIV reservoir is created
during untreated infection and maintained during treated infection. Results should aid in efforts to design
therapeutics towards a functional or sterilizing HIV cure."

Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) fails to eliminate HIV-1 persisting in reservoirs or prevent long-term
complications in people living with HIV (PLWH); therapy interruption leads to rapid viral rebound. Therefore, new
approaches aimed at eradicating HIV-1 or enabling durable virus control without cART are needed. This is an
R01 application in response to the NOFO PAR-23-297: “Opportunities for HIV Cure Strategies at the Time of
ART Initiation (R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)”. This application is built on collaborative research centered around
the development and translation of small-molecule CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mcs) as a cure strategy for
HIV-1. CD4mcs synergize with CD4-induced (CD4i) Env antibodies (Abs) to render virus-infected cells highly
vulnerable to antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and clearance by immune effector cells. These
CD4i Abs are present in most PLWH. This application leverages the recent discovery of a new class of indoline
CD4mcs that displays remarkable improvements in antiviral potency and breadth against diverse primary HIV-1
strains. Treatment of HIV-1-infected humanized mice (hu-mice) with an indoline CD4mc and two types of CD4i
Abs (anti-CoRBS/anti-Cluster A Abs) at the time of cART initiation resulted in a dramatic reduction in the size of
the viral reservoir. This early CD4mc/Ab regimen enabled sustained virus control after analytical treatment
interruption (ATI)! Furthermore, we identified a new family of Abs in PLWH that recognizes additional CD4i Env
epitopes and that cooperate with indoline CD4mcs to significantly enhance ADCC.
In line with these exciting discoveries, this application proposes three independent and interactive aims:
Specific Aim 1 will investigate physiological variables (virologic parameters and timing of treatment) that facilitate
effective reservoir elimination by CD4mc/Ab interventions in new-generation hu-mice that support immune
effector cell function. In addition, multi-dimensional single-cell analytical techniques will identify the phenotypes,
physiology and spatial organization of immune-effector cells and virus-infected cells in tissues harboring HIV-1
reservoirs. These studies will determine the factors related to CD4mc/Ab intervention that tip the balance in favor
of durable viral control after ATI.
Specific Aim 2 will formulate a highly effective CD4mc/Ab cocktail by screening plasma of PLWH to identify
additional families of CD4iAbs with enhanced potency in mediating ADCC and evaluate them in hu-mice.
Specific Aim 3 will systematically explore how the properties of the infecting viral Env influence reservoir
establishment and susceptibility to elimination by the new indoline CD4mc/Ab cocktails in hu-mice.
The outcome of these proof-of-principle studies is expected to inform the development of a CD4mc/Ab-based
early intervention cure strategy for HIV-1."

Title: Sleep, Brain Development, and Behavioral Correlates in a Longitudinal Cohort of Children at Risk
for ASD
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are 2-3 times more likely to suffer from sleep problems than
typically developing children. Despite being a high priority population for sleep research, and despite evidence
that sleep problems have pervasive negative consequences for health, behavior, mood, and cognition, the
increased occurrence and clinical impact of sleep problems in individuals with a family history of ASD is not
well understood. This major public health concern is the focus of our application, “Sleep, Brain Development,
and Behavioral Correlates in a Longitudinal Cohort of Children at High-Risk for ASD”. Problems with sleep
initiation, circadian timing, and inadequate amount of sleep in a high familial risk (HR) cohort of school-age
children are hypothesized to be preceded by altered brain and behavioral development in early childhood.
This proposal leverages a recently funded longitudinal follow-up of school-age (7-12-year-old) HR children
and children with low familial risk for ASD (LR) who have had multiple MRI and behavior assessments since
infancy through the NIH Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS). This sample of 300
HR children includes ~100 diagnosed with ASD at 24 months, ~200 without a diagnosis of ASD but with
outcomes ranging from typical development to developmental and psychiatric disorders known to occur at
high rates in siblings of children with ASD, and 100 LR children currently returning for assessment, including
MRI, during school age. A biopsychosocial model of pediatric sleep problems predicts that some combination
of biological, environmental, behavioral and psychiatric factors will account for the increased prevalence of
sleep problems in ASD, but it is unknown whether sleep problems are familial, endophenotypic, or disorder-
specific in this population. We propose to: (1) characterize circadian disturbances, sleep duration, and other
sleep parameters in the home using actigraphy, validated by sleep diary, and through parent report of
behavioral and medical sleep problems, (2) examine brain growth trajectories (from infancy) associated with
sleep problems in school-age, and (3) examine the longitudinal behavioral and developmental trajectories
and concurrent behavior associated with sleep problems in school-age. Increased understanding of the
neurobiology and developmental characteristics of sleep problems in ASD has important implications for
developing novel, developmentally-sensitive sleep interventions which may help to reduce behavioral and
health problems exacerbated by sleep problems and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population."
11010580,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our population is aging. As our population ages, the incidence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), an age-associated
illness, grows, resulting in elevated health care costs. A second factor contributing to the current rise in age-
associated aliments is the American diet with its ever-increasing amount of added sugar. The negative effects of
added dietary sugar is in part due to advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which form from the process of
glycation where a sugar molecule attaches to a protein or lipid without enzymatic regulation thereby altering its
structure and/or function. AGEs form in normal metabolism but when AGEs rise to high levels in tissues and
circulation, as in diabetes or high dietary sugar, they can become pathogenic since AGEs promote oxidative
stress and inflammation. A third contributor to the increases in AD is the microbiome; recent studies have linked
age-associated illness with changes in the microbiome. The central unifying hypothesis of this proposal is that
consumption of a sugar-loaded diet alters the microbiome and contributes to the onset and severity of AD. We
will address this hypothesis with two specific aims using a Caenorhabditis elegans–Escherichia coli system.
Our experimental C. elegans–E. coli paradigm is an excellent system for these studies because: (1) C. elegans
are bacterivores and have an obligatory symbiotic relationship with microbes as their food source, which
becomes the intestinal microbiota; (2) C. elegans possess stress and immune signaling pathways that are
evolutionarily conserved; (3) Genetic tools are available including transgenic strains for AD whereby human β-
Amyloid precursor protein (Aβ peptide) is driven by a tissue specific promoter. (4) We can modify the environment
(added sugar) resulting in changes in the levels of dietary AGEs(dAGEs); and (5) Our preliminary data show
when C. elegans consume live (microbiota) or heat killed (no microbiota) sugar-loaded high- dAGE E. coli, C.
elegans have a shortened lifespan and reduced healthspan. Our results also demonstrate the importance of
the microbiota as a buffer for stress. In Specific Aim 1, we will address the effects of a sugar-loaded high-dAGEs
diet on AD transgenic animals with heat killed or live bacteria. In Specific Aim 2, we use a series of genetic tools,
(including mutants, transgenics)to provide mechanistic insight. This proposal exploits a symbiotic relationship to
define how a sugar loaded/high dAGEs diet promotes Aβ accumulation. Our results in the two- year period could
be paradigm shifting in our understanding of the impact of added dietary glucose on AD. The long-term goal is to
modify diet to delay or even eliminate the onset of AD."
11016903,"Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the only output neurons that relay visual signals from the eyes to the brain.
RGC death is a crucial element in the pathogenesis in many retinal diseases leading to blindness, such as
glaucoma and optic nerve injury. These diseases are also the leading causes of blindness of veterans. The
prevalence of blinding diseases in veterans is very high and about 20.5-63.4% of veterans were diagnosed with
at least one ocular disease. A significant cause of vision defects of VA patients is traumatic optic neuropathy
(TON) related to traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a significant cause of death and disability worldwide, and it
is estimated 1.6-3.8 million new TBI cases occur in the US each year. About 57-66% veterans with TBI had
vision problems and no treatment for TON is more effective than observation. Therefore, the treatment of vision
impairment related to TBI is a significant challenge for the VA healthcare system, and it has been limited by
incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediating the RGC death in these diseases. In
addition to the primary injury, secondary injuries dramatically worsen the damage and cause about 40% of TBI
deaths. One of the significant secondary injuries of TBI and TON is glutamate excitotoxicity, the pathological
process by which neurons are damaged and eventually killed by excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors.
This process also plays critical roles in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as glaucoma, which specifically
injure RGCs. Therefore, effectively minimizing or preventing glutamate excitotoxicity is crucial to reduce RGCs
death and preserve vision. Based on the understanding of the mechanisms which control the vulnerability of
RGCs, we plan to develop novel treatment strategies to prevent RGC death in these diseases.
 Recent studies have shown that immune molecules play essential roles in neuron repair and cell death in
CNS diseases. In the retina, the receptors of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, T-cell
receptor, (TCR) and their associated proteins are expressed by RGCs. The mutation of these molecules reduced
the susceptibility of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity and optic nerve crush (ONC). These findings strongly
support the possibility that MHCI/TCR could protect RGCs from death. Also, the susceptibility of RGCs to
glutamate excitotoxicity and ONC vary significantly among different types of RGC and the types of pathological
insults. These results demonstrate that multiple mechanisms regulate the death of RGCs and, therefore, the
treatment strategies to prevent RGC death in diseases need to be designed accordingly.
 In this study, we plan to conduct proof-of-principle studies to establish the role of MHCI-TCR as a critical
mediator of neuronal injury induced by glutamate excitotoxicity and ONC. Our preliminary results showed that
susceptibility of RGCs to NMDA excitotoxicity and ONC is RGC type-dependent, mutation of CD3z significantly
reduces the susceptibility of RGCs, pharmacological inhibition of Src family member, Hck, and ZAP70 protects
RGCs, and RGCs express both Hck and ZAP70. We will further determine whether Hck protects RGCs through
CD3z activation, whether the protective efficacy of Hck and ZAP70 inhibitors on RGCs is type specific, and
whether systemic application of the inhibitors protects RGCs as effective as an intraocular injection (Aim 1). We
will also determine whether the protective efficacy of the inhibitors of Hck and ZAP70 on RGCs in ONC is RGC
type-dependent (Aim 2). Finally, we will prove the principle of whether the co-application of inhibitors of Hck or
ZAP70 with a mGluR1 antagonist protects RGCs synergistically and to establish the optimal strategy for RGC
protection (Aim 3). The research will use state-of-art pharmacological, genetic, cellular, imaging,
electrophysiological and behavioral approaches, which has several unique advantages: it is grounded in a robust
yet entirely novel mechanistic framework built on current neuroscience, it targets multiple ocular injuries and
diseases commonly seen in VA patients, and may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy relevant to several eye
diseases and TBI in veterans."
11016904,"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a devastating disease characterized by dyspnea, cough, fatigue and poor survival.
Veterans who served in desert regions overseas have an increased risk of developing respiratory diseases
including PF as a result of exposures in theater. The incidence of respiratory disease in Veterans is ~4-16-fold
greater than those exposed to inhaled occupational hazards alone (based on Work-Related Lung Disease
Surveillance Report 2007, NIOS and Health Analysis of VA Health Care Utilization among OEF/OIF/OND
Veterans Report, VHA), suggesting an additional factor contributes to Veterans’ risk. Chronic psychological
stress-associated mental health diseases disproportionately affect Veterans, are associated with increased
inflammation, and may be one contributing factor to respiratory disease among Veterans. Current therapeutics
provide limited effectiveness and do not address the multifactorial nature of PF, indicating the critical need to
understand risk factors for PF and develop improved therapeutics for our nation’s Veterans.
 Our preliminary data demonstrated that chronic stress exacerbated PF. Our laboratory has identified a novel
myeloid circulating fibroblast precursor (CFP) population that is elevated in a silica-induced model of PF and in
chronic stress. CFPs exhibited an activated phenotype defined by increased co-stimulatory molecule expression,
and promoted a pro-inflammatory pulmonary microenvironment in PF. Therefore, we hypothesize that chronic
stress exacerbates silica exposure-induced PF through myeloid lineage dependent mechanisms. Toward this, a
chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model in conjunction with a highly relevant silica exposure-induced model of
PF will be employed in three specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the impact of CUS on exacerbation of PF
through clinically relevant parameters in vivo and examine the temporal participation and activated phenotype
of myeloid cells in disease. Aim 2 will determine the role of glucocorticoid (GC) signaling in myeloid
proinflammatory cytokine production and in disease promotion. Aim 3 will examine the role of DDR2/collagen
I signaling in the immune functions of CFPs in PF exacerbated by CUS. Adoptive transfer gain-of-function
studies and transplantation-based loss-of-function studies will be employed to directly test the causal role of
CFPs in PF. These studies will provide critical insight into immune response to combat exposures and an
understanding of the pathological impact of chronic stress.
 These studies are innovative in the use of highly relevant models of CUS and exposure-induced PF with
direct applicability to Veterans’ health. Short-term, these studies will provide increased understanding of the
myeloid-dependent, CFP-driven mechanisms, and molecular (glucocorticoid signaling) mechanisms leading to
CUS exacerbation of PF. These studies will also identify unexplored mechanisms of immune function through
activation of the novel CFP and will determine the causal role of the CFP in CUS exacerbation of PF. Long-term,
examination of therapeutic agents targeting specific cellular populations and pathways identified in these studies
may lead to new translatable therapeutic targets for PF. These studies utilize state-of-the-art small animal
imaging, behavioral, flow cytometric, and shRNA core facilities. The multi-disciplinary mentoring team has
expertise in immunology, fibrosis, signaling, and statistics and will ensure the success of the proposed studies.
The Applicant is genuinely committed to the missions of the VA and has a strong record of publication,
collaboration, and contributions to the VA research community. The immediate goal of this CDA is to allow the
Applicant to develop new areas of expertise, technical skills, and career tools necessary to pursue a career as an
independent VA investigator. This will be accomplished through coursework, hands-on training, networking,
and mentoring opportunities provided by the CDA mechanism. Long-term this will allow the Applicant to
develop an independent, innovative, and collaborative research program focused on exposure-induced PF and
co-morbidities that disproportionately affect Veterans."

Ohio University (OHIO) is an Institution of Emerging Excellence committed to conducting focused
biomedical research. Through establishment and strengthening of two research institutes (the Diabetes
Institute/DI and the Ohio Musculoskeletal and Neurological Institute/OMNI) over the past two decades, OHIO
has demonstrated a longstanding commitment to integrating clinical education, patient care, and research to
help residents and trainees directly confront the local and global challenges of obesity, diabetes, pain, and
aging in place. Recent strategic investments have strengthened the research environment within these
institutes and, consequently, bolstered the overall biomedical research portfolio of the entire university. In fact,
these two institutes are responsible for over half of the university’s NIH funding portfolio and include a cadre of
successful, multidisciplinary scientists conducting basic, clinical, and population health research. As a result of
recent expansions and funding successes in the DI and OMNI, there is now an urgent need to improve the
outdated biomedical research facilities and infrastructure at OHIO. To that end, the institution has secured $67
million dollars (most of the funding required) for a new biomedical research facility, named the Heritage
Translational Research Center (HTRC). The HTRC will foster collaborative research among institute members
by consolidating research currently fragmented across numerous buildings on campus and promote
collaboration between basic and clinical scientists to bolster translational research. This new facility will also
move research efforts to spaces that are purpose-built for research and vacate aging buildings that are no
longer appropriate for conducting modern biomedical sciences. This C06 project seeks to specifically fund the
construction of a vivarium within the top floor of the HTRC to support the activities of the animal-based
researchers of DI and OMNI. The new vivarium will provide OHIO with a contemporary animal housing facility
and replace an existing vivarium in an aged facility, expanding capacity (increasing total mouse cages by
64%), efficiency, and biosecurity as well as augment procedural and shared equipment space to support
rodent research. A major impact of the HTRC animal facility will be to support current and future NIH-funded
projects by OHIO researchers, facilitate external collaborations that rely on the novel mice or mouse tissues
generated by DI or OMNI investigators, and attract future, planned faculty hires within these institutes. Aligned
with its educational mission, OHIO will also use this building to train graduate, undergraduate and medical
students in animal models of disease. Completion of the new translational research facility at OHIO, which
relies on building the proposed animal facility, is expected to have a powerful and sustained impact on the
translational research efforts of DI and OMNI; their NIH-funded research; the research of their many external
collaborators; regional companies that rely on OHIO’s infrastructure; osteopathic medical school research
locally and nationally; and the underserved surrounding community."
11020434,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Wounds have a sizable impact on public health: 1 out of 50 Americans has a chronic wound at any given time
and the cost of wound care exceeds $100 billion per year. Similarly, hypertrophic scars with excessive scar
tissue greatly impair quality of life for millions of patients. However, therapeutic solutions for wound healing
(WH) remain quite limited.
Sex has received growing interest as a factor in wound healing, and some studies show higher rates of non-
healing wounds in men. It has long been known that in male rodents testosterone (T) impairs WH via androgen
receptor effects. Sex hormone (SH)-induced changes in wound repair have been studied as a possible risk
factor, but their impact is uncertain due to factors like illness that alter hormone levels. A novel and promising
way to better understand this link is to examine WH in transgender patients on exogenous hormones.
However, research into the effects of gender-affirming hormones has not kept pace with rapid clinical
population growth. We developed new models and showed that T limits wound healing in large animals with
different effects in XX vs. XY animals. Further, we have shown that patients on T have impaired wound
healing. A critical knowledge gap that remains unaddressed is the set of molecular mechanisms and pathways
testosterone acts through to change the wound healing response. We have identified new immunomodulatory
effects of T that may mediate these effects. Conversely, estradiol (E2) may accelerate wound repair rates.
Essential aspects of how E2 improves wound healing – how E2 levels affect the response, what cell subtypes
E2 acts through, and whether E2 effects differ between XX and XY subjects – remain similarly unknown.
We will address these gaps in understanding sex hormone modulation of WH with a program spanning three
project directions, including overcoming the failure of current in vitro models to recapitulate the in vivo wound
cell behavior changes induced by sex hormones (Project 1: In Vitro System), defining how testosterone
modulates the evolution of the immune response during wound healing to impair closure and how this induces
a fibrotic or regenerative repair response (Project 2: Mechanisms of T Immunomodulation). Finally, we will
expand our work to deeply profile the effects of estradiol on immune cell subtypes and the wound cytokine
milieu and define how sex chromosome complement alters this response (Project 3: Estradiol Wound Healing
Mechanisms). This project will deploy innovative tools to probe SH-WH mechanisms, expanding scientific
knowledge of how T and estradiol interact with sex chromosomes to regulate wound healing biology.
This study seeks to transform current concepts of how hormones modulate wound repair with the dual aim of
improving care for a marginalized patient population and developing potential new approaches for millions of
patients with chronic wounds."

Proteome integrity is maintained by a complex network that regulates protein synthesis, folding,
transport, and degradation. Lysosomes are the catabolic center of a cell and central to
maintaining proteome homeostasis by preventing, detecting, and removing abnormal proteins.
Major knowledge gaps remain in the regulation, structural components, and substrate
specificities of lysosomal substrates. Intracellular proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteasome
system has been the most well-characterized eukaryotic proteolytic pathway as the protein
targeting by ubiquitin and the amino acid sequences recognized by E3 ubiquitin ligases are
well-defined. In contrast, a major obstacle in understanding lysosomal processes is the
incomplete knowledge of protein modifications that enable lysosomal trafficking mechanisms.
Our work identified that arginine methylation leads to protein delivery into lysosomes for
degradation. We showed that rapid methyl-driven delivery was essential for removing enzymes
from the cytosol to promote growth and proliferation. The proposed studies examine the central
hypothesis that methyl-driven lysosomal proteolysis is a widespread process that enables
natural protein turnover during homeostasis and rapid protein remodeling in response to
external stimuli. We address this hypothesis in three areas of research. Area 1 defines novel
protein substrates and the peptide motifs required for lysosomal delivery. Area 2 determines the
functional impact of rapid methyl-driven delivery as a control mechanism for fundamental
cellular metabolic pathways. Area 3 leverages naturally-occurring lysosomal protein signals to
develop tools for researchers to rapidly decrease protein levels in endogenous living systems.
We test the conceptually novel model that selective lysosomal proteolysis is central for
regulating cytosolic, short-lived proteins that were previously thought to be degraded in
proteasomes. We anticipate use of our publicly available database of novel methyl-degraded
lysosomal proteins will provide an essential resource for the fields studying protein control. We
develop technically innovative tools to gain new mechanistic insight into lysosomal biology for
the present studies while also providing a tool for the broader research community that
significantly improves current strategies for endogenous protein depletion.

The challenge of effectively treating cancer is further complicated by the limitations of current CAR-T cell
therapies, especially when confronted with the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TIME). Central to
this issue is the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which induces T cell exhaustion and curtails their
antitumor potency. Current methodologies to inhibit the TGF-β pathway have yielded suboptimal results due to
transient effects. This project introduces PyroTIMER CAR-T cells, an innovative approach that promises durable
inhibition of all TGF-β isoforms within the TIME. This robust strategy not only targets TGF-β with unprecedented
potency but also incorporates multiple technical advancements, enhancing T cell cytotoxicity and leveraging
patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models for a more accurate representation of the tumor milieu.
The overarching research plan is to thoroughly assess PyroTIMER CAR-T cells in both immunocompetent
syngeneic models and PDX models. Employing multi-parametric flow cytometry, we aim to delve into the immune
dynamics within tumors, elucidating how PyroTIMER CAR-T cells interact with and potentially remodel the TIME.
Our objectives are four-fold: 1. Deciphering the influence of TGF-β on PyroTIMER CAR-T cells. 2. Profiling
cytokine production to gauge risks, particularly concerning cytokine release syndrome (CRS). 3. Investigating
potential exhaustion scenarios in PyroTIMER CAR-T cells. 4. In-depth in vivo evaluations of the safety and
efficacy of PyroTIMER CAR-T cells.
Our long-term trajectory is underpinned by a commitment to patient safety and therapeutic efficacy. By forging
collaborations with pharmaceutical entities, refining manufacturing strategies for scalability, and seeking FDA
endorsement, we aspire to position PyroTIMER CAR-T cells at the forefront of personalized cancer therapies.
This initiative represents a harmonious blend of advanced scientific inquiry, patient well-being, and strategic
commercial planning. Through this endeavor, we aim to redefine CAR-T cell therapy, presenting a novel, potent,
and safer treatment paradigm for cancer patients."
11010160,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a life-long disorder that alters joint biomechanics and increases
the risk of early osteoarthritis. The most common treatment for DDH is periacetabular osteotomy (PAO), which
surgically reorients the abnormally shaped acetabulum to better cover and stabilize the femoral head. After PAO,
patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) improve for many, but not all, patients, and PROMs for most
patients remain below the levels of their healthy peers. Recent work has shown that aberrant biomechanical
variables, including disproportionate joint reaction forces, high acetabular edge loads, and low abductor muscle
strength, are related to specific geometric deformities in DDH prior to PAO. These altered biomechanics are also
related to worse PROMs. The current project seeks to optimize surgical care for DDH by determining the effects
of, and relationships among, PAO-induced changes to hip geometry, biomechanics, and PROMs. The overall
goal of the parent R01 project is to rigorously investigate how periacetabular osteotomy changes hip
biomechanics and how those changes are associated with patients’ activity levels and self-reports of function,
pain, and quality of life during the first year after surgery. This supplement request in response to PA-23-189:
Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (Admin Supp Clinical Trial Not Allowed)
will support the training and career development for a PhD student whose long-term goal is to be a senior-level
independent investigator at the crossroads of biomechanical engineering, orthopedics, and movement science.
The supplement scholar will enhance the impact of the parent R01 by investigating the morphology and
biomechanics of the contralateral hip in patients with DDH who receive PAO. Many patients present with bilateral
evidence of DDH but only unilateral symptoms. After PAO, half of patients develop contralateral hip symptoms
and thirty percent receive hip preservation surgery. Thus, the contralateral hip is an important component in the
overall treatment of patients with DDH and in our understanding of DDH as an osteoarthritis precursor. The
supplement scholar will also receive customized training and mentoring to foster her growth as a scientist. It is
expected that this supplement will provide the scholar foundational training to progress to her next career step
and enable her to advance as an important voice of under-represented senior investigators in the biomedical
sciences."

There is a critical shortage of mental health specialists (i.e., psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed
mental health counselors) and a growing mental health crisis in the US. Task sharing, whereby highly
qualified health workers share specific tasks non-specialist providers (NSPs) with less training and
fewer qualifications in order to make more efficient use of the available human resources, is an
approach that can scale and address unmet mental health needs, particularly in hard-to-reach
communities with limited to no access to specialist care. We propose a comprehensive solution to
support a task sharing approach for delivering high quality brief psychosocial interventions. Our
proposed digital platform is designed to support measurement-based peer supervision (MBPS), which
includes the ability for NSPs to record therapy sessions, rate them using a validated quality scale, and
review ratings safely and securely with peers in moderated group discussions. We developed and
successfully demonstrated acceptability, usability, and potential feasibility of digitally-enabled MBPS to
support NSP performance and quality of care in Phase I. The goal of this Phase II project is to enhance
and evaluate the efficacy of this digitally-enabled MBPS tool with NSPs working directly in communities.
We will address this goal with three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will build an enhanced version of the
digital platform based on Phase I feedback and direct input from NSPs. In Aim 2, we will conduct a
mixed methods evaluation of digitally-enabled MBPS with 50 target end users, i.e., NSPs recruited from
a large health system in Texas and recently trained in behavioral activation. During this period, NSPs
will engage in mock sessions with standardized patients. Primary outcomes of interest will be NSP
competency in delivering behavioral activation therapy and counselor self-efficacy. In Aim 3, we will
conduct a cost analysis for the system under different implementation rollout and volume assumptions.
Results from these analyses will be reviewed with stakeholders and will be used to develop a cost
calculator to inform the development and comparison of sustainability models. The proposed digitized
MBPS workflow would allow quantitative data on therapy quality to be collected at scale which, in turn,
could be used for a wide range of analyses, including measuring the effectiveness of types, cadences,
or duration of therapy, as well as building tools using predictive analytics. Results of this Phase II work
can provide important insights to guide the implementation and scaling of effective delivery of
psychosocial interventions and program quality improvement, with the long-term goal of improving
mental health outcomes in hard-to-reach communities that can benefit the most from NSP-led support."

are needed to ensure that PrEP reaches all people who could benefit. A promising implementation approach to
increase PrEP access is through household-based TB contact investigation, which is a leading strategy to
decrease TB morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-incidence settings like Uganda. Care models that
integrate HIV testing in household TB contact investigation are being evaluated. However, PrEP has not been
integrated into TB household contact investigation in high-prevalence settings.
 Recently, we found that couples identified in households affected by TB in Kampala, Uganda were twice
as likely to be serodifferent for HIV than couples in the general population (16% vs. 8%), suggesting that people
living in TB-affected households may benefit from PrEP. Multiple studies have shown that household-based
linkage to PrEP is feasible and effective in high HIV-burden settings, including among HIV serodifferent couples
and pregnant people. We therefore propose to adapt the proven intervention of PrEP to a new setting of
household TB contact investigation and evaluate its implementation, effectiveness, and costs using the RE-AIM
implementation framework, a widely used framework for evaluating how proven interventions perform in a new
delivery context. We hypothesize that integrating HIV prevention into household TB contact investigation will be
a feasible, acceptable, effective, and cost-effective strategy for expanding access to status-neutral HIV services,
including HIV self-testing and linkage to antiretroviral therapy and PrEP.
 In Aim 1, we assess the implementation and effectiveness of home-based HIV self-testing and PrEP
initiation versus standard clinic referral for PrEP during household TB contact evaluation in Uganda. We use a
household-randomized trial design and test the hypothesis that home-based PrEP initiation will increase PrEP
uptake and retention compared to clinic referral. In Aim 2, we use qualitative methods to examine the processes
of implementing HIV self-testing and PrEP during household TB contact investigation. In Aim 3, we estimate the
cost-effectiveness of the strategy to integrate home-based HIV testing and PrEP with household TB contact
investigation to assess its sustainability. This work is impactful because understanding how to offer HIV self-
testing and PrEP in the setting of household TB contact investigation will facilitate increased use of PrEP, an
underutilized innovation for HIV prevention, by leveraging existing health programs."
11008305,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic viral and bacterial infections are characterized by pathogens that are difficult to control by the host
immune system and therapeutic interventions. Evasion of anti-infection mechanisms for a number of these
pathogens can be attributed to the formation of structured populations, comprised of highly organized pathogen
subgroups with specialized, cooperative functions. Pathogen communities, such as biofilms, can arise as a result
of replication, initiating with just one infectious particle. Effective persistence in the face of natural and synthetic
defenses, however, requires maintenance in the form of compensatory mutations that correct for deleterious
mutations favoring individual fitness over that of the population. These co-evolutionary events can be observed
over time via genomic sequencing of individual subgroups and, importantly, can be used to investigate unknown
biological pathways or mechanisms. HIV shares many characteristics with bacterial biofilms and other social
viruses, including chronic infection, antiretroviral resistance, and population structure among and within infected
host organs. Given these characteristics, it was not surprising to uncover initial evidence of across-tissue co-
evolution in the SIV-infected macaque model. In the absence of a cure for HIV infection, there is a critical need
to explore alternative behaviors that can explain HIV persistence and lead to novel therapeutic strategies. The
overarching objective of this proposal is to improve our understanding of the complex population dynamics
that characterize chronic HIV infection through 1) development of a novel statistical phylogenetic tool (GOSIP)
and framework, capable of reliably identifying cooperative behavior through compensatory evolution, and 2)
application of this tool/framework to full-genome sequence data available from an existing cohort of extensively
sampled SIV-infected macaques. The central hypothesis is that the implementation of a statistical graphical
modeling approach can accurately capture co-evolving sites in interacting subpopulations, including those of the
SIV intra-host population. The innovation of this project lies in its treatment of cooperative behavior as the
driving factor of the HIV population survival in the face of immune and therapeutic defenses, which can be
statistically inferred via a novel phylogenetic platform."
11009252,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV infection is commonly co-occurring with drug use. Both HIV infection and drug use are associated with
adrenal dysfunction and hormonal dysregulation, which can drive impairments in response to stress. Stress is a
major factor affecting HIV disease outcomes and susceptibility to relapse, however there is a lack of
understanding of the factors that promote relapse in people living with HIV. Responsivity to stress is regulated
by the glucocorticoid, cortisol. HIV can result in enhanced basal cortisol levels, but reduced cortisol responses
to stress. In contrast, cocaine dependence is associated with enhanced basal and stress-induced cortisol
responses. However, the interaction of HIV infection and cocaine use on cortisol levels is not well characterized.
In rodent models, cocaine exposure enhances the corticosterone response to stress in male and female rodents,
while tat transgenic male, but not female, mice exhibit blunted corticosterone responses to stress. Thus, HIV-
infected females may be more vulnerable to stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking due to lack of
blunted corticosterone responses by tat. Glucocorticoid signaling at astrocytes may be an important mediator of
this response. The glucocorticoid receptor can be downregulated in response to stress, and this effect appears
to be specific to astrocytes. Astrocytes are also important mediators of relapse-related behaviors and are
independently regulated by cocaine and HIV infection. Further, modulation of glucocorticoid receptors regulates
astrocytic calcium signaling, suggesting that stress modulates astrocytic activity. Our preliminary data indicate
that stress-induced reinstatement of reward seeking is associated with enhanced astrocytic calcium signaling in
the reward-paired context. Thus, astrocytic glucocorticoid signaling may be a potential regulator of the stress
response and stress-induced relapse-like behavior in the context of HIV infection. Aim 1 will determine the effects
of EcoHIV inoculation on stress-induced corticosterone levels and astrocytic glucocorticoid receptor expression
following a history of cocaine exposure in male and female mice. Male and female mice will be inoculated with
EcoHIV and undergo cocaine exposure and withdrawal, and then be subjected to forced swim stress. Serum
corticosterone levels and immunofluorescent labeling of astrocytic GR will be assessed to determine if female
mice exhibit enhanced stress responses following EcoHIV infection. Aim 2 will determine whether EcoHIV
infection sex-specifically promotes stress-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. Male and female mice will
be inoculated with EcoHIV and be trained in a conditioned place preference paradigm for cocaine, followed by
extinction and reinstatement following forced swim stress exposure to determine if EcoHIV-infected female mice
exhibit enhanced stress-induced reinstatement. The results of these experiments will identify a potential target
for reducing stress-induced relapse in people living with HIV. Further, we will gain significant knowledge of sex-
specific regulation of the glucocorticoid system by EcoHIV infection."
11009327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV remains the leading cause of death among adults in South Africa despite the availability of antiretroviral
therapy (ART) due to failure to initiate ART and failure to remain on ART. Among people living with HIV
(PLWH) who are hospitalized, 17-26% die within 6 months of hospital discharge potentially contributing to
more than half of all HIV-associated mortality in South Africa. There are heterogenous reasons for mortality
that include missed diagnoses, psychosocial barriers to completing treatment plans, and structural barriers that
include food insecurity. To respond to the complexity of underlying causes of mortality we developed and
piloted a disease neutral intervention to reduce posthospitalization mortality: HomeLink. This intervention
consisted of structured posthospitalization home care visits with psychosocial counselling and nutritional
supplementation and reduced posthospitalization mortality by 60%. These results raise important questions
regarding reproducibility and scale-up of this intervention. In order to inform policy, the most feasible and cost-
effective elements need to be identified. Here we are proposing a fully powered study of a refined HomeLink2
intervention to compare usual care to structured home visits or home visits plus nutritional supplementation. In
addition, we will identify underlying mechanisms of the intervention effectiveness including the impact on
timeliness of acute care, medical diagnoses, adherence to ART (through viral load testing), and psychosocial
metrics. We will further assess implementation outcomes to guide future refinement of intervention delivery.
Finally, we will use findings from the randomized trial to complete costing and cost-effectiveness analyses to
inform policy makers regarding cost of HomeLink2 and cost-effectiveness of home visits alone or home visits
plus nutritional support to inform potential scale-up and long-term sustainability. This project has the potential
to generate considerable new knowledge on interventions that could dramatically reduce HIV-associated
mortality in South Africa and other low- and middle-income settings. This proposed study is very likely to
generate actionable knowledge to improve outcomes for PLWH and contribute to overall goals of HIV epidemic
control."
11009421,"Abstract
To reach Ending the Epidemic (ETE) targets, we will need consistent national HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) data to describe patterns of use, and to understand which programs and policies are effective at
facilitating PrEP uptake. Our team has used national PrEP prescription datasets that combine diverse sources
in order to better understand how PrEP is being brough to scale. National prescription datasets are robust and
capture a great deal of data. We propose to develop the PREMISE (PrEP Epidemiology, Modeling, and
Surveillance) group that will use national PrEP data, along with legal and policy coding, to inform the US HIV
epidemic response. Legal and program environments in which individuals initiate PrEP are highly
heterogeneous, yet evidence regarding which policies lead to improved outcomes is lacking. Our past work
demonstrated a substantial association between PrEP use and the presence of PrEP drug assistance
programs. ETE programs have expended considerable resources in HIV prevention promotion programming.
Natural experimental designs can provide evidence regarding PrEP uptake in light of such programs. Such
analyses require developing nuanced datasets of policies and programs. Our team has extensive experience
in both PrEP program and policy data collection, allowing for rigorous assessment. The study will conduct
analyses regarding the scope and equity of PrEP scaleup over time, and will perform analyses to explore the
impact of different locality-specific programs and policies on PrEP starts and PrEP equity. We will use modeling
and cost-effectiveness analyses to contextualize findings and facilitate dissemination"
11016905,"Since their introduction to the marketplace, Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) have
experienced a rapid growth in popularity as a means to deliver nicotine to the user in unprecedented high
concentrations and purity. There is little evidence pertaining to the consequences this route of nicotine self-
administration has on the health of the naïve user or those who use this product to aid in cigarette smoking (CS)
cessation. This Merit application is designed to fill gaps in our understanding of these issues. Here the focus
will be on how the lung morphology and normal gene expression including a defined response to the inhaled
house dust mite allergen is impacted by ENDS:nic exposure, especially in the lung previously exposed to
cigarette smoke. There are 3 interactive Aims to address the Project Hypothesis: The use of nicotine as delivered
by electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS:nic), both in the naïve lung and subsequent to cessation of
cigarette smoking (CS), impacts the morphology and immune responsiveness of the exposed lung and
complicates normal recovery processes following CS cessation. Specific Aim 1. Does ENDS:nic exposure
impact lung morphology, mucin production and fibrosis in the naïve lung and the lung previously
damaged by CS exposure? Measurement of ENDS:nic effects on the lung will include morphologic changes
in alveolar spaces, mucin production (e.g., Muc5b) and deposition, and changes to collagen deposition (fibrosis).
Results will determine how the form of nicotine (salt versus free-base) and its relative concentrations impact
these parameters. We further hypothesize that ENDS:nic exposure (and possibly carrier alone) will alter lung
morphology and that mice previously exposed to CS will not recover to the same extent as mice that are allowed
to recover in the absence of END:nic use and possibly carrier. Specific Aim 2. Does ENDS:nic impact
immune function in naïve mice and does the transition from cigarette smoke to ENDS:nic exposure
impede immune functional recovery? ENDS:Nic delivery strongly suppresses the lung eosinophil response
to inhalation of the common house dust mite (HDM) allergen. This reliable experimental measurement provides
an end-point to quantify the impact by different ionic forms of nicotine, their concentration and the associated e-
liquid carrier compounds. The focus will also be on transcriptional responsiveness to HDM by AM and specific
lung cellular signaling responses during recovery from prior CS-associated damage in the context of ENDS:nic
relative to no product use as well as the impact by ENDS:nic itself. Specific Aim 3. How are alpha7-modulated
cell-signaling mechanisms in the alveolar macrophage (AM) affected by ENDS:nic exposure? These
experiments will focus on alveolar macrophages (AM) which constitute the majority of immune cells in the
bronchial alveolar lung fluids (BALF). Newly developed methods that combine AM enrichment from the BALF of
ENDS:nic and CS exposed mice and in vitro response to treatment with defined cytokines (IL-4+IL-10) will be
done in the presence of specific inhibitors of cell signaling intermediates and positive allosteric modulators of the
AM target of nicotine, the nicotinic receptor alpha7. The AM transcriptional response mechanisms will be
measured using RT-PCR as well as RNA-Seq.
 Collectively, this study will provide the first comprehensive view of AM responsiveness after ENDS:nic
exposure and how ENDS:nic use impacts the lung during recovery from previous cigarette smoking."

Adverse reproductive outcomes, including preeclampsia and hypertension, preterm birth, growth restriction, and
small for gestational age birth contribute significantly to maternal and infant morbidity and mortality and can lead
to long term health consequences for both mother and offspring. The placenta plays a central role in successful
pregnancy outcomes, fetal development, and it is increasingly being recognized for playing an important role in
developmental programming of the fetus and contributing to childhood health and disease. Environmental
chemicals are known to contribute to the risk for adverse reproductive outcomes and these chemicals may be
eliciting their toxic effects through impacts on the function of the placenta. One particular function of the placenta
that is only beginning to be fully understood is its role as a peripheral molecular clock. Disruptions to the
molecular clock are recognized to be involved in several adverse reproductive outcomes and recent data
suggests that deregulation of molecular clock genes impacts important placental cellular processes such as cell
migration. There is also evidence to suggest that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) maybe a central regulator
of the placental molecular clock and that a mixture of toxic chemicals, including pesticides, alters the placental
molecular clock through inhibition of EGF signaling through the EGF receptor (EGFR). These findings support
the premise that a properly functioning molecular clock is required for placental health. However, it remains
unknown if environmental chemicals cause placental dysfunction via molecular clock disruption. This
consortium, consisting of a placental toxicologist (Veiga-Lopez), circadian biologist (Hoffmann), and pregnancy
molecular epidemiologist (Marsit), has developed a project that will lead to an understanding of how gestational
environmental exposures impact the molecular clock resulting in placental dysfunction, by examining the overall
hypothesis that chemicals that interfere with molecular clock signaling through EGFR lead to placental cell
dysfunction in a gestational age- and placenta layer-specific manner. In a mouse model, we will examine how
gestational age, placenta layer, and sex impacts molecular clock sensitivity to chemical exposures. In human
placenta cellular models, we will identify mechanisms through which the molecular clock proteins PER1, PER2,
and PER3 impact cellular function upon chemical exposures. Finally, using a pregnancy cohort of farm-working
women and their offspring, we will determine the association between pesticide exposure and placental
molecular clock gene dysregulation and build causal evidence by comparing results to those from the mouse
model. Through this new and exciting collaboration, there is a unique opportunity to comprehensively
demonstrate the importance of the placenta as a peripheral clock and to provide evidence that exposures
relevant to the human population impact the placental molecular clock which has lifelong implications for health
and disease."
11017313,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Misdiagnosis is prevalent in younger women with dense breast tissue receiving breast cancer screening,
resulting in missed cancers, needless follow-up testing, anxiety, and medical costs. Compared to mammography,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects more breast cancers but still suffers from high false positive rates
due to the conventional contrast agents used, e.g., gadolinium (Gd)-chelates. Our long-term goal is to develop
novel, safe contrast agents for early detection of breast cancer that reduce the false positives and false negatives
of breast MRI. The poor performance of Gd-chelates results from their lack of targeting and constant MRI signal.
By remaining active, Gd-chelates produce high background signal in normal tissues and highlight both benign
and malignant tumors. To address our long-term goal, we have developed Nano-, Encapsulated Manganese
Oxide (NEMO) particles that will provide superior replacements for Gd-chelates. Our preliminary data shows that
NEMO particle specificity is achieved by adding peptide targeting to underglycosylated mucin-1, which is
overexpressed exclusively on breast cancer cells. NEMO particles provide a unique pH-switchable signal that is
only activated upon internalization in acidic tumor cell endosomes (pH 5). No MRI signal is produced at pH of
the blood (pH 7.4) or tumor extracellular space (pH 6.5). Our in vivo studies demonstrate that NEMO particles
are safely tolerated in mice and exhibit a stronger signal than Gd-chelates. Currently, no high throughput method
exists for testing new MRI contrast agents that predicts in vivo performance. The goals of the current project are
to develop an innovative portable apparatus to enable evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity, and safety profile
of NEMO particles vs. Gd-chelates using MRI and optical imaging of 3D microfluidic tumor models. Our central
hypothesis is that NEMO particles will elicit low toxicity, specifically label breast cancer cells, and yield higher
MRI contrast compared to Gd-chelates in 3D microfluidic tumor models and in mice with breast cancer. Our
hypothesis will be tested with two aims: 1) Evaluate NEMO particle vs. Gd-chelate MRI contrast in 3D microfluidic
tumor models and mice. 2) Evaluate toxicity and distribution of NEMO particles in 3D microfluidic tumor models
and mice. This project is innovative because NEMO particles uniquely respond to endosomal pH to generate
contrast only inside breast cancer cells to provide a simple binary readout (benign “OFF”, malignancy “ON”).
Previously developed pH-sensitive MRI contrast agents respond to the acidic extracellular space, which is similar
in benign and malignant tumors. We will also create a novel apparatus to enable MRI of 3D microfluidic tumor
models for the first time. The proposed research is significant because we will demonstrate that NEMO particles
have superior specificity, signal strength, and safety compared to Gd-chelates. This R15 award will offer cutting-
edge training to undergraduates in nanomaterials and medical imaging research at West Virginia University.
Over 3 years, 6 undergraduates pursuing engineering or biomedical sciences degrees will be recruited, trained,
and assessed. This work will lead to further preclinical development and clinical trials of NEMO particles."
11017108,"Project Summary/Abstract
Skeletal muscle weakness is a hallmark of aging and cancer cachexia with significant impacts on individual
healthspan and quality of life. Despite the clinical significance, no pharmacological therapies are currently
available to attenuate muscle atrophy and weakness in the elderly and in patients with cancer cachexia. The
goal of this project is to test the ability of a novel and promising pharmacological intervention, unacylated
ghrelin, to delay skeletal muscle weakness and loss of muscle mass in aging and in cancer cachexia.
Ghrelin is a hormone that increases appetite when the acylated ghrelin binds to its receptor in the brain, growth
hormone secretagogue receptor-1a (GHSR1a). An acute rise in acylated ghrelin increases lean mass in wasting
conditions, but a concurrent increase in adiposity and decreased sensitivity in GHSR1a receptor lead to atrophy
and contractile dysfunction. In contrast, recent studies show a direct beneficial effect of the unacylated ghrelin
on muscle, independent of GHSR1a activation. Incubating myoblast with unacylated ghrelin increases
differentiation and fusion into myotubes, and inhibited glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy and proteolytic
markers. An increase in unacylated ghrelin protected skeletal muscle from denervation-induced atrophy.
Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to test the ability of unacylated ghrelin to mitigate loss of muscle mass and
weakness in two distinct degenerative conditions-sarcopenia and cancer cachexia. The following aims are
proposed: Aim 1: To determine whether unacylated ghrelin prevents neurogenic atrophy with aging by altering
rates of protein synthesis and degradation in muscle. Aim 2: To determine whether unacylated ghrelin prevents
contractile dysfunction with aging through modulations of calcium handling and sensitivity. Aim 3: To determine
whether unacylated ghrelin prevents a rapid wasting and contractile dysfunction in cancer cachexia. In order to
understand the molecular mechanisms of unacylated ghrelin in skeletal muscle cells, member of my laboratory
will perform state-of-the art molecular biology and integrative physiology techniques to assess in vivo protein
turnover rate and calcium handling and sensitivity of myofilaments. If the results support our hypothesis, clinical
trials will be warranted. Unacylated ghrelin and its synthetic peptides have excellent safety profiles in humans
and animals with null association to cancer cell growth."
11017457,"Summary (Parent Grant)
Reconstructive surgeons are tasked with the restoration of soft tissue loss irrespective of etiology. Over the past
two decades, hydrogel scaffolds have become a vital platform for tissue revascularization and surgical repair.
However, their slow and random vascularization upon implantation often precipitates failure and precludes true
tissue regeneration and function. Native microvascular networks are characterized by organized tree-like
branching patterns that originate from large feeding vessels. Our objective is to utilize complementary
regenerative strategies based upon rigorous preliminary data that enables the rapid development of this
hierarchical microvasculature. To achieve our objective, we recently developed an innovative microsurgical
tactic termed vascular micropuncture (MP). In this method, small perforations are created using a needle in the
recipient vasculature to facilitate cellular extravasation and angiogenesis, without causing thrombosis or
significant hemorrhage. Such induced angiogenesis can be used to randomly vascularize an adjacently placed
hydrogel scaffold, leading to perfusion within 24 h and a doubling of neovascularization. With this compelling
result, we propose to advance the MP method using an emerging in situ microengineering technology. We have
developed granular hydrogel scaffolds (GHS) based on an extracellular matrix mimetic material with controlled
microporosity that improves cell infiltration and guides vascular network formation both in vitro and in vivo.
Our hypothesis is that customized GHS can be synergistically used with MP to hasten and precisely guide
hierarchical microvascular development. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on the following three independent
specific aims: 1) To design and optimize GHS to guide microvascular development, 2) To evaluate the effect of
MP characteristics to hasten microvascular development and 3) To evaluate the coupling effects of MP and GHS
to hasten and precisely guide hierarchical microvascular development. The successful completion of these
studies should markedly improve the vascularization of scaffolds used in soft tissue reconstructive surgery. Also,
it sets the platform for further investigation in building a hierarchical microvasculature that is cornerstone to blood
flow regulation, oxygen diffusion, and immune cell modulation. Consequently, our novel approach holds
immense potential for broadly advancing regenerative medicine."

(e.g., GRIN lenses) to improve outcomes in aging research. Additionally, the project supports Qingguang
Zhang. Ph.D. through the NIA Research and Entrepreneurial Development Immersion (REDI) program at a
small business. Entrepreneurial development activities for his project will include project factors such as
reaching Design Freeze in an ISO-13485 system, Verification and Validation, Patent Development, FDA-
Regulatory interactions and MedTech business operations. Dr. Zhang will interact with AMI mentors that have
experience in translating their academic skillsets to commercial and R&D activities at a small company.
Public Health Problem: Aging and neurodegenerative disorders are associated with loss of dendritic
complexity, demyelination of axons and reduced neuronal excitability. Optical imaging tools such as fiber
photometry, and implantable GRIN lenses coupled to head mounted microscopes, can be used to image
neuron morphology and activity beyond the depths accessible through multiphoton microscopy. However,
tissue damage caused by their surgical implantation methods can result in similar changes in neural activity
and morphology as seen in aging and cognitive decline, confounding experimental results. Previous studies of
oscillated insertion of needles into the peripheral tissue and electrodes in the central nervous system have
reduced insertion force and tissue damage.
A tool is needed to reliably reduce tissue damage and strain associated with implantation of large diameter
(>100µm) imaging lenses used in optical neuroscience to eliminate the experimental confound and improve
studies of age-related changes in neuron morphology and function.
Value Proposition: This project develops the Optical Neuroscience Insertion Tool (ONIT) to improve insertion
dynamics of GRIN lenses and other optical neuroscience systems. Later work will expand ONIT to insert large
devices, like DBS probes, with less tissue damage, for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in humans.
Aim 1- Optimize, build, and test lightweight ONIT system. (AMI: Months 1-9).
Acceptance Criteria: Construction of a computer controlled ultrasonic actuator capable of 1) grasping and
releasing fiber optic cannula and GRIN lenses with vacuum pressure, 2) Advancing the implant at speeds less
than 100µm/sec, 3) reducing the puncture force of fiber optic cannula (200µm diameter) >60% in an ex vivo
rodent brain tissue model, and 4) monitoring force applied to actuator during insertion.
Aim 2 - Demonstrate improved signal to noise of in vivo measures of neural activity and histological
markers of neuron complexity for six weeks following oscillated insertion of large diameter GRIN
lenses in a rodent model. (Months 9-12; AMI/ PSU).
Acceptance Criteria: Ability to insert large diameter GRIN lenses without the need for tissue aspiration,
reduced attenuation (>50%) of baseline and evoked GCaMP7f signal intensity 6wks following implant.
Reduced histological indicators of neurodegeneration (>50% greater neuron complexity using Sholl analysis)
and scar formation (<50% compared to control GFAP+ area) within 500µm of GRIN lenses implanted with
oscillated insertion.
Commercialization & Marketing: Early sales via third party distributors will be reinvested to continue
development towards a clinically relevant system to insert similarly large DBS electrodes, a market expected to
reach $4.3B by 2030."

 RNA plays a central role in many gene-regulatory processes and is viewed as an important drug target.
Riboswitches are natural RNA sensors typically found in bacterial mRNAs where they bind cognate metabolites.
This process elicits riboswitch conformational changes that control expression of downstream genes. Although
most riboswitches bind only a single ligand, we discovered that the Type I preQ1-I (class I) riboswitch recognizes
two metabolites, leading to positive cooperativity that extends the riboswitch’s preQ1-sensing range in bacterial
cells. The discovery that a small, single-domain RNA can bind two metabolites is unprecedented in the field. The
importance of this discovery is heightened by the fact that the Type I sub-class is the most prominent preQ1-
sensing riboswitch in the biosphere and exists in many human pathogens. Surprisingly, cooperative binding by
the Type I preQ1-I riboswitch has gone undetected for more than a decade — until now. The overarching goal of
this proposal is to define the underlying molecular attributes that confer cooperativity and its interplay with preQ1-
sensing during bacterial gene regulation. To address this challenge, we developed innovative tools including: (i)
adaptation of a bacterial reporter assay in which the Type I preQ1 riboswitch controls GFPuv expression, which
revealed two EC50 values for preQ1 binding; (ii) development of software for analysis of cooperative isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC) data, which yields microscopic binding constants whose ratio quantifies cooperativity;
and (iii) refinement of our GFPuv reporter coupled in cell (ReCo-ic)SHAPE (selective 2´-hydroxyl acylation
analyzed by primer extension) assay to pinpoint functionally-relevant, preQ1-dependent riboswitch conformations
in live bacteria. These approaches form a rigorous foundation to define the chemical determinants of cooperative
ligand binding and to evaluate their effects on biological function. We will address our central goal in three aims:
(1) Determine crystal structures of Type I preQ1 riboswitches in apo and bound states; (2) Define riboswitch
chemical attributes that confer cooperative binding and evaluate their role in bacterial gene regulation; and (3)
Define gene-regulatory conformational changes using ReCo-icSHAPE in concert with all-atom computational
approaches to delineate cooperative binding pathways. We are a team of experts with strong records in: RNA
crystallography, effector binding, RNA chemical modification and bacterial reporter assays (Wedekind, P.I.); RNA
dynamics and computational prediction of RNA structure using experimental restraints (Mathews, co-I); next-
generation sequencing (Pritchett, collaborator); and biophysical approaches (Jenkins, collaborator). Given our
novel premise, expertise and team synergy, we are uniquely qualified to perform this work. High-value outcomes
include a new structural and chemical understanding of cooperative binding by the smallest natural riboswitch
aptamer, which we hypothesize is a hallmark of the entire Type I sub-class. Overall, the proposed analysis will
broaden our understanding of RNA-mediated gene regulation, which has implications for antibacterial targeting."

When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur,
including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this
context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions
of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in
environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite
these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our
group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress,
negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural
alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an
open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias
(ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can
mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort
funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities
across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000
eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional
psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment,
and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with
identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social
support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of
resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable
psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of
the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD."

Amyloid diseases afflict >10 million patients worldwide and involve pathologic deposition of ~40 human proteins
as fibrils. This project is focused on AA amyloidosis, a life-threatening complication of chronic inflammation
wherein deposition of a small plasma protein, serum amyloid A (SAA), and its fragments causes kidney and liver
damage and, if untreated, death. There is no cure for AA and the treatment options are very limited. To help
design amyloid-specific therapies, we will determine how lipids and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the major lig-
ands of SAA, influence its misfolding. Our prior research revealed that SAA clears diverse lipids from the sites
of injury by sequestering them into nanoparticles that facilitate sPLA2 lipolysis; we established the structural basis
for this SAA action. Our goal now is to determine how this lipid-scavenging function is linked to pathologic amyloid
deposition. Our hypothesis rooted in extensive pilot studies is that lipoprotein formation by SAA is antagonistic to
amyloid formation while GAG binding is agonistic. Our powerful approach integrates a wide array of biochemical,
biophysical and computational methods to test this and other new ideas in three complementary Specific Aims.
Aim 1 will determine how biochemical composition of SAA-lipid complexes influences amyloid formation. Murine
or human recombinant SAA will be reconstituted with diverse lipids in complexes that will be selectively hydro-
lyzed, and amyloid formation will be explored by spectroscopic, electron microscopic, immunochemical and other
tools. The results will help identify key steps in SAA-lipid homeostasis that critically influence amyloid formation,
and will test a fascinating idea: lipid-modifying strategies may help treat AA amyloidosis. Aim 2 will dissect the
amyloidogenic pathway of lipid-bound and free SAA and the effects of GAGs. Our multipronged experimental-
computational approach will explore the interplay between SAA binding to lipids, to GAGs, and formation of
amyloid oligomers and fibrils. SAA-GAG interactions are a validated therapeutic target in AA, but a small-mole-
cule drug designed to block them was inefficient in clinical trials. Our hypothesis is that GAGs act as amyloid
scaffolds; to test it, we will harness cryo-EM structures of ex vivo amyloids for molecular dynamics simulations.
The results will help target SAA-GAG interactions in AA and will provide sharp insights into amyloid-GAG inter-
actions in other diseases. Aim 3 will utilize our new versatile ELISA-based assay that uses micrograms of protein
to quantify the binding to amyloid modulators during fibrillogenesis. SAA binding to various GAG mimetics and
small-molecule drugs will be used as a model; key results will be validated by other methods. Our pilot studies
explain the failure of prior clinical trials for AA and suggest that larger molecules can block the SAA-GAG binding.
Moreover, we will use our new assay to determine how other amyloid proteins (Aβ, α-synuclein, tau, TTR, etc.)
interact with diverse amyloid modulators (GAGs, apoE, etc.) Impact: this project will advance AA research and
therapeutic targeting to a new level. Moreover, it will develop new tools and concepts that can be extrapolated
to other systemic and neurodegenerative amyloid diseases, such as Alzheimer's and other major diseases."

these findings, the overall objective of this grant is to pursue the fundamental understanding of the role of the
muscle circadian clock in regulating a daily program of gene expression and how clock disruption leads to
significant muscle weakness and diminished systemic health.
We found that MyoD1 can modulate expression of the core clock gene, Bmal1 making it a bona fide tissue-
specific circadian clock modifier1. We have also determined that MyoD1 and CLOCK:BMAL1 share peak
binding at over 3000 sites across the muscle genome. These new findings provide support for our studies to
define the mechanism(s) through which MyoD1 modulates the network properties of the clock mechanism as
well as understanding the role of MyoD1 as a clock co-factor in the daily genomic and transcriptomic
landscape in adult muscle.
Downstream from MyoD1 and the clock factors, my lab has identified two muscle specific genes, Rbm20 and
Tcap, that we propose link clock disruption with muscle weakness. Loss of muscle Bmal1, results in significant
decreases in Rbm20 and Tcap expression and we find changes in sarcomere structure including variability of
sarcomere length, distortions in M and Z lines and altered myofilament orientation. Lastly, the global Bmal1
knock out mouse, Bmal1KO, has been used as a model of advanced aging as it exhibits significant aging-like
pathologies and has a median lifespan of 37wks. In preliminary experiments using this global Bmal1 KO
mouse we rescued Bmal1 in skeletal muscles using an AAV vector with a muscle specific promoter. We found
that this was sufficient to significantly improve muscle strength but also significantly extended lifespan. These
are complementary to our findings of increased mortality with loss of muscle Bmal1 and demonstrate that
rescuing Bmal1 only in skeletal muscle improves systemic health. In addition, with aging and many chronic
diseases exhibiting muscle clock disruption, these results suggest that targeting the muscle clock mechanism
holds potential as a translational strategy. We propose to test the following three specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: To define the roles of MyoD1 within the core clock mechanism and as a co-factor for the daily
transcriptomic landscape in skeletal muscle.
Specific Aim 2: To test the clock controlled genes, Rbm20 and/or Tcap, for their roles in sarcomere structure
and muscle function.
Specific Aim 3: To determine the skeletal muscle specific changes required for improved lifespan in the Bmal1
KO mouse."

Metastasis causes >90% of cancer death. The persistence and lethality of metastasis is driven by cells capable
of self-renewal, slow cell-cycling, tumor re-initiation, and therapy resistance, termed metastasis stem cells
(MetSCs). Development of effective strategies for eliminating metastasis requires a better understanding of the
mechanisms that MetSCs exploit for survival. We recently demonstrated that (1) disseminating colorectal
cancers (CRC) undergo a dynamic phenotypic switch from an LGR5+ tumor-initiating cancer stem cell (CSC)
state to a distinct LGR5lowL1CAM+ state required for metastasis. (2) L1CAM+ MetSCs are functionally distinct
from intestinal tumor-initiating LGR5+ CSCs: L1CAM is required for organoid formation, the regeneration of
intestinal epithelium after colitis, and tumor formation after metastatic dissemination. But unlike LGR5, it is
dispensable for epithelial homeostasis or intestinal tumor initiation. In contrast to tumor initiation, where
homeostatic stem cells undergo oncogene-driven hyper proliferation in intact tissues, metastasis subverts a
regenerative mechanism to survive and regrow outside an intact epithelial niche. (3) We have shown that the
principal driver of L1CAM expression is loss of epithelial integrity itself, acting via loss of E-cadherin intercellular
adherens junctions to transiently displace the transcriptional silencer REST/NSRF from chromatin in quiescent
MetSCs, in turn derepressing expression of L1CAM and other genes required for tissue regeneration1.
Proliferation, restoration of epithelial structures, and macrometastatic outgrowth, on the other hand, require high
REST levels. Our evidence suggests that MetSCs cells are regenerative stem cells that emerge directly in
response to loss of epithelial integrity to drive repair, a phenotype of physiological wound healing that is
redeployed in MetSCs. Molecular mechanism by which REST chromatin binding is dynamically regulated in
MetSCs, and how this in turn enables cell fate plasticity from stemness to proliferation, is unknown. In neurons,
ZFP36L1/2, members of the tristetraproline family of CCCH RNA binding proteins, have been shown to bind to
AU-rich elements in the REST 3’UTR and target REST mRNA for degradation2. ZFP36L1/2 are required for self-
renewal of early burst forming unit erythroid progenitors3, and for maintenance of quiescence in lymphocytes
and muscle progenitors4. Project hypothesis: The ZFP36L1/2-REST axis is a master regulator of cell fate
plasticity in intestinal epithelial progenitors, with loss of ZFP36L1/2 function impairing progenitor self-renewal
and metastatic seeding, but in turn promoting proliferation. Aim 1: Define the function of the ZFP36L1/2-REST
axis in normal and neoplastic intestinal stem cell self renewal, differentiation, and proliferation. Aim 2: Dissect
the molecular mechanism of ZFP36L1/2-mediated cell fate plasticity. Aim 3: Determine the functional
consequences of ZFP36L1/2-REST dynamic regulation in metastatic seeding and colonization. Results will
define mechanisms of cancer progression and identify putative therapeutic targets to limit regenerative plasticity,
with potential to impact clinical outcomes."
11008443,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ten percent of the approximately four million infants born in the United States each year are
born premature (<37 weeks gestational age). Preterm birth prior to the maturation of critical
neonatal body systems results in prolonged hospitalizations that impose an annual societal cost
burden of $26 billion. Achievement of the ability to fully orally feed is often the last
developmental milestone these infants achieve, with the time it takes for patients to meet this
milestone accounting for as much as 90% of the variance of their total length of hospital stay. In
addition to prolonging neonatal hospital stays these swallowing deficits (dysphagia) pose
detrimental health effects including pulmonary aspiration, cardiopulmonary instability, and
malnutrition. Early diagnostics and treatment are critical to maximizing neonatal health
outcomes and reducing hospital expenditures. While the gold standard videofluoroscopic
swallow study is an effective diagnostic method, its emission of harmful radiation limits its
regular clinical utilization. The available alternative assessment, clinical observation, is
subjective with inherent limitations in its validity of detecting underlying deficits. nuBorn
Medical has developed a SMART bottle that allows for the non-invasive objective assessment of
an infant's oropharyngeal sucking and swallowing abilities. With this tool clinicians can identify
swallowing deficits and determine the appropriate treatment regimens to enable earlier and
more accurate methods of dysphagia management than in the current standard of care. In this
Phase II STTR investigation, nuBorn Medical's SMART bottle will undergo its final stages of
product refinement to maximize user experience, and and gather critical information necessary
to substantiate claims in its upcoming FDA application."

Sub-Saharan Africa is home to >70% of people with HIV (PWH) globally. It is also burdened with rising rates of
tobacco use, high rates of unhealthy alcohol use, and high rates of tobacco and alcohol co-use. These
disparities are amplified in PWH in this region. Tobacco users drink more and alcohol users smoke more and
quit less than mono-users. Tobacco combines with alcohol to exert a destructive synergy expressed, in
particular, in extremely high rates of aerodigestive (especially esophageal) cancers. Kenya is the 7th most
populous country in Africa, with 54 million people, 1.6 million of whom are PWH. Tobacco and alcohol use
rates in Kenya, including Kenyan PWH, are higher than those in most sub-Saharan nations. Incidence rates of
esophageal cancer in Kenya are 2.9 times those of the US in men and 8.4 times those of the US in women.
There is an enormous need for better strategies to manage tobacco and alcohol co-use in Kenya and
throughout the world. Our group has been engaged in tobacco treatment research for PWH in Nairobi, Kenya
since 2018. We are completing a 2 x 2 factorial design randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Positively Smoke
Free intensive behavioral counseling ± bupropion, and we have collected detailed information on alcohol usage
in Kenyan PWH in the course of that study. We have created and piloted a new version of Positively Smoke
Free counseling to include content related to alcohol co-use and strategies to cut down or quit alcohol use.
Cytisine is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist that has been used for tobacco treatment since the
1960’s, mostly in Eastern Europe, Russia, and Canada. Multiple trials of cytisine, conducted almost exclusively
in White participants, have demonstrated that its efficacy in promoting smoking cessation is comparable to
varenicline, the first line tobacco treatment in the US. Cytisine is inexpensive, safe, and does not interact with
antiretroviral therapies. It is a potent treatment for alcohol dependence in animal models, but data to support its
use for this purpose in humans are scarce. There is virtually no published experience with cytisine on the
African continent, but Kenya’s Ministry of Health has expressed interest in this affordable agent if it is proven
effective in a Kenyan population. A placebo controlled trial of intensive counseling ± cytisine for Kenyan PWH
who smoke and drink alcohol heavily will advance the science of tobacco and alcohol co-use, it will strengthen
the case for cytisine use in Kenya and other low- and middle-income nations if effective, and it will address
significant health disparities in a resource-constrained area of the world. In this application to renew
1R01CA225419, we propose a 2 x 2 factorial RCT comparing Positively Smoke Free including alcohol-referent
content to standard care and comparing cytisine to placebo. We will study both tobacco and alcohol use
endpoints as primary and secondary outcomes. We will also examine putative mediators of intervention effects
on study outcomes. Finally, we will complete detailed cost analyses to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the
trial interventions in relation to the trial’s tobacco and alcohol use outcomes."

Codomax has developed the Epi-MAX platform, an integrated omics and computational-based strain and gene
engineering technology that leverages cellular stress responses to enhance protein production and enable the
efficient expression of difficult-to-express proteins. Many therapeutic proteins are difficult to express in high yields
due to mRNA that are inefficiently translated or suboptimal polypeptide assembly into functional protein.
Achieving efficient protein production is a pain point for customers in the biomanufacturing industry, as poor
expressing and costly proteins may be abandoned due to their lack of commercial viability. Codomax’s innovation
is grounded in our team’s discovery that cells adapt to stress, including the cumulative stress of protein over-
production during biomanufacturing, by reprogramming their tRNA pools to enhance translation of mRNAs with
distinct codon usage patterns. The Epi-MAX platform leverages this translational reprogramming mechanism to
increase recombinant protein expression in cells by matching codon usage in the target gene to the stress-
reprogrammed tRNAs. To date, the Epi-MAX platform has yielded up to 25-fold boosts in production of difficult-
to-express proteins in Pichia pastoris. Despite the utility of Pichia as one of the major hosts for industrial protein
manufacturing, protein production is plagued by intracellular aggregation and faulty transport through the
secretory pathway. We now propose to extend the Epi-MAX platform to increase stress translation of
endogenous Pichia chaperones that prevent intracellular protein aggregation and facilitate transport of secreted
recombinant proteins. Overexpression of the chaperones Kar2, calnexin, and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI)
has been demonstrated to significantly increase secreted recombinant protein yields for a range of enzymes and
therapeutic proteins produced in Pichia. However, chaperone over-expression may create additional stressors
that impede cellular productivity, as exemplified by reports of reduced recombinant protein secretion following
Kar2 overexpression. Thus, the goal of this project is to address limitations in secretory protein production in
Pichia to boost recombinant protein production yields by increasing the levels of chaperones via enhanced stress
translation of their mRNAs. We will apply the Epi-MAX platform to Pichia expressing human interleukin-2 (IL-2),
as a model recombinant biologic, to optimize the IL-2 gene and the genes for Kar2, PDI, and calnexin to enhance
translation of their mRNAs (Aim 1). CRISPR-Cas9 tools will be used to replace the native genes with the stress
codon-engineered chaperone genes. To prevent exhaustion of the cell’s tRNA pool from competition for the
limited tRNA pool, we will identify and over-express the tRNAs responsible for decoding the engineered optimal
stress codons (Aim 2). Limited proteolysis-coupled mass spectrometry will be used to assess intracellular protein
aggregation and proper folding. Successful completion of this Phase I project will demonstrate the Epi-MAX
platform’s applicability to address protein assembly bottlenecks and generate designer Pichia strains, chaperone
gene sequences, and CRISPR-Cas9 reagents for enabling efficient difficult-to-express biologics production."

The robust nonhuman primate (NHP) SIV/AIDS research portfolio at the Emory National
Primate Research Center (ENPRC), which reached $23.8 million in FY2023 alone, has placed
significant and unsustainable demands on the Emory NPRC rhesus macaque SPF breeding
colony. To meet the current and projected future research demand, ENPRC is proposing to
demolish an existing small NHP run housing building at the ENPRC Field Station from 1969 that
needs to be decommissioned, and replace it with a larger run housing building to facilitate
expansion of the SPF breeding colony. The new animal housing proposed will consist of 16
indoor/outdoor run housing areas as well as a cage housing room and clinical support space.
This run housing will provide optimal small group breeding to support SIV/AIDS research by
facilitating targeted genetic breeding for specific research requests, as well as colony
management space needed to optimize breeding. The proposed new animal housing at the
Field Station will allow for significant expansion of the SPF rhesus macaque colony over the
next five years, thus providing additional animals to support the current and projected SIV/AIDS
research program for investigators at Emory NPRC as well as for external collaborators to
address the nationwide shortage of NHPs for research."
11008785,"Project Summary
 Netherton syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder of significant severity impacting the skin, hair,
and immune system. The condition arises from mutations within the SPINK5 gene, responsible for
encoding LEKTI (Lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor), a serine protease inhibitor. Ordinarily, the skin's
exfoliation process is modulated by the balance between these serine proteases and their inhibitors.
Mutations in LEKTI lead to elevated serine protease activity, leading to the persistent skin condition
associated with NS. Unfortunately, an FDA-approved therapy remains absent for this condition, with
management of symptoms primarily relying on antibacterials, emollients, and corticosteroids. Most
therapeutic efforts are to develop small molecule inhibitors, but systemic absorption of these long-
lasting molecule often results in toxicity.
 We propose to genetically engineer a harmless bacterium to temporarily populate the skin and
deliver LEKTI fragments, that normally have a short half-life, continuously. In our Phase I SBIR, we
established the safety and feasibility of our topical application. In this Phase II application, we fully
develop our final cell therapy and show efficacy in diseased in vitro and murine models. This data will
provide the crux of our pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) meeting with the FDA. Our platform for
continuous production of peptide drugs on the skin surface has the potential to revolutionize the
treatment of NS."

 HIV continues to be a major public health concern for Hispanic/Latino gay, bisexual and other men who
have sex with men (GBMSM) in the U.S. Immigrant/migrant Latino GBMSM make up the largest proportion of
foreign-born sexual minority population and are a key group vulnerable to HIV acquisition and transmission, yet
are rarely the focus of funded research. Immigrant/migrant Latino GBMSM are more likely to receive delayed
HIV diagnoses and to be uninsured/underinsured than U.S.-born Latinos, in addition to facing immigration-
related barriers to care. Spatial segregation among immigrant/migrant Latino GBMSM is linked to diminished
proximity to Spanish-language pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and HIV service navigation services and
reduced access to culturally competent PrEP and HIV care, creating an increasingly invisible HIV burden.
Rates of new HIV diagnoses and HIV viral suppression vary dramatically between countries of origin for
immigrant/migrant Latino GBMSM. Geographic mobility has been shown to enhance HIV vulnerability and
adversely impact HIV care and treatment in people living with HIV, yet there is limited data on how geographic
mobility impacts PrEP and HIV care outcomes among Latino GBMSM in the U.S. Further, geographic mobility
may lead to positive outcomes, as people may travel for better access to HIV prevention and care services, or
move toward better support networks or away from HIV and PrEP stigma prevalent in their communities.
 To address the knowledge gap regarding the impact of geographic mobility for Latino GBMSM on PrEP
and HIV care outcomes and to inform future interventions, the Specific Aims for this exploratory proposal are:
Aim 1: To characterize patterns of geographic mobility in the past 3 years, including destinations, temporality
(including duration, frequency, or seasonality), purpose, and level of planning over travel among 40 Latino
GBMSM not living with HIV (on/not on PrEP) and 40 Latino GBMSM living with HIV (on/not on ART) in NYC
using qualitative in-depth interviews and mobility maps.
Aim 2: To determine how past-year geographic mobility impacts PrEP care outcomes (PrEP
initiation/adherence, retention and persistence in PrEP care) and HIV care outcomes (ART
initiation/adherence, retention in care, and viral suppression) longitudinally over 12 months.
We will ensure a range of Latino GBMSM experiences are included, by purposive sampling by: living with and
without HIV, region of birth (Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Mexico/Central America, and South America),
and recent vs. non-recent immigrant/migrant to the U.S. Our approach is innovative, as it examines the
impact of geographic mobility on PrEP and HIV care outcomes among Latino GBMSM who have been
disproportionately affected by HIV and have been understudied, applies mobility maps in a novel way, and has
potential to inform future design of interventions to improve PrEP and HIV care outcomes in this population."
11009236,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are currently over 100,000 older (ages 50+ years) women living with HIV/AIDs (WLWH) in the United
States. Advances in antiretroviral therapy treatment have led to a decline in mortality caused by HIV/AIDS,
however, experiences of HIV-related and gender-based stigma continue to adversely impact health outcomes
in this population. People living with HIV who experience HIV stigma are more likely to delay seeking care and
have depressive symptoms and lower quality of life. Yet, older adult women are understudied in research on
stigma and HIV. The purpose of this proposed study is to examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal impacts
of HIV stigma and gender-based stigma on cognitive function among older WLWH and identify whether social
support is protective against the adverse impacts of stigma on cognitive function. We will use data from the
Women's Interagency Study (WIHS), a longitudinal, prospective cohort of WLWH in the United States. WIHS
was established in 1993 and has enrolled almost 5,000 WLWH to date. Cognitive function was assessed using
multiple standardized and validated neurocognitive assessments. Stigma and social support were also
assessed using validated survey scales. For the proposed study, we will include all participants who have
completed baseline stigma and social support questionnaires before the age of 50 and at least one (cross-
sectional analysis) or two (longitudinal analysis) cognitive assessments. The proposed work will test whether
HIV stigma and gender-based stigma are independently associated with current cognitive function and change
in cognitive decline, and whether there are interaction effects between HIV and gender-related stigma. We will
also examine whether social support is protective of cognitive decline despite experiences of stigma. We
hypothesize that 1) self-reported HIV stigma or gender-based stigma will be associated with worse cognitive
performance and greater cognitive decline; 2) experiences of both types of stigma will be associated with
worse cognitive performance and a greater cognitive decline compared to experiencing either type alone, and
3) among those who experienced high levels of stigma, those who report higher levels of social support will
have better cognitive performance and lower cognitive decline compared to those who report low levels of
social support. These analyses will be done using mixed-effects cross-sectional and longitudinal regression
models adjusting for known risk factors for cognitive decline. Findings from this study will provide much needed
information about the extent to which individual and compounding effects of stigmatizing experiences should
be considered in health promotion interventions for older WLWH, as well as insight into a potential protective
factor (social support) that could be leveraged to improve health outcomes in this population."
11009232,"Abstract: Commercial minibus drivers constitute a large social network of highly mobile men
who work long and demanding hours, are at increased risk for HIV, and have limited time to
seek health services for HIV. In our preliminary work, our team found a high HIV seropositivity
rate of 12.5% among 407 commercial minibus drivers in Nigeria, a prevalence that is nine times
higher than the national HIV average. Despite the high willingness to test for HIV among the
drivers, the mobile nature of their work poses substantial barriers for those living with HIV to
initiate and adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and for those who are HIV-negative and are at
risk for HIV to obtain pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Therefore, innovative strategies such as
HIV self-testing (HIVST), which allows individuals to test at home or in private, and long-acting-
injectable ART (LAI ART) or LAI PrEP may work better to address the barriers that impede
commercial drivers from accessing HIV testing, prevention, and treatment services. Our team
has recently evaluated a youth-friendly HIVST intervention combined with linkage to PrEP in
Nigeria as part of an NIH-funded project called ITEST: Innovative Tools to Expand Youth-
friendly HIV Self-Testing (UH3HD096929). We propose to leverage our established research
program in Nigeria in collaboration with the National Institute of Medical Research to implement
a tailored ITEST intervention for commercial minibus drivers (ITEST LAIs), which will include
male peer-led distribution of HIV self-testing kits combined with demand creation for both oral
and LAI modalities of ART and PrEP. Our multi-disciplinary research team proposes a hybrid
type I effectiveness-implementation study to assess clinical and implementation determinants
outcomes simultaneously. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: Determine the comparative
effectiveness of the I-TEST LAI intervention compared to SoC on LAI PrEP uptake and HIV
prevention among minibus drivers in Nigeria. In addition, explore the impact of mediating and
moderating factors on influencing primary and secondary outcomes. Aim 2: D etermine the
effectiveness of the I-TEST LAI intervention compared to SoC on LAI ART uptake, retention in
care, and viral suppression among minibus drivers living with HIV with viral suppression (VL
below 1000 HIV RNA copies/ml). In addition, explore the impact of mediating and moderating
factors on influencing primary and secondary outcomes. Aim 3: As part of our type 1 hybrid
implementation-effectiveness design, assess determinants of implementation, and estimate
cost-effectiveness to inform scale-up and dissemination."
11009194,"ABSTRACT OF PROPOSED RESEARCH
Antiretroviral agents (ARV) have proven successful in preventing new HIV transmission and improving survival
and quality of life in people living with HIV (PLWH). However, there is still no cure, and issues of poor medication
and medical care adherence and limited access to medication are proving challenging and warrant long-term
release formulations. Currently, ARVs available or in development are either long-acting or self-administered,
but not both. Islatravir (EFdA) is a highly potent, sub-nanomolar HIV-1 nucleoside reverse transcriptase
translocation inhibitor that is in Phase 3 development by Merck for the prevention and treatment of HIV-1. A low
dose has recently proven to be safe and effective in PLWH. The high potency of EFdA and the long intracellular
half-life of its active metabolite EFdA 5'-triphosphate (EFdA-TP) make it a strong contender for long-acting
regimens. The overall goal of this study is to develop biodegradable microneedle patches (MNPs) that
encapsulate ARV (such as EFdA) for long-acting release using a self-administered patch. This sustained drug
release can minimize the dosing interval from daily to monthly or longer, which will provide substantial benefits
to PLWH, will address issues of adherence in therapy and prophylaxis, and serve as a good drug administration
route for pediatric patients and persons experiencing homelessness, and be particularly beneficial in certain
parts of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa. The specific aims are: 1) To formulate self-administrable
microneedle patches for EFdA delivery and optimize their extended release in vitro for at least one month;
2) To determine the in vivo pharmacokinetics of EFdA and its intracellular active metabolites after
delivery by a drug-loaded microneedle patch. Towards these goals, we will investigate biodegradable
polymers and casting solvents for the microneedle, and water-soluble materials for the patch backing, to
formulate, fabricate, and characterize EFdA-loaded MNPs. We will test the release of EFdA from MNPs in vitro
and select one or two MNP designs that release EFdA for at least one month to determine the in vivo
pharmacokinetic profile first in rats and then in larger animal such as rabbits. We will compare EFdA release
from MNPs to delivery by subcutaneous injection and oral administration. We anticipate that at least one MNP
design that releases EFdA for at least one month will have a pharmacokinetic profile where the concentration of
EFdA in plasma and of active metabolite EFdA-TP in lymphocytes will be maintained above the target level for
at least one month. We believe PLWH or persons at risk for HIV (including pediatric persons) will greatly benefit
from the potential long-term outcomes of these novel therapeutic and prophylactic patches designed to increase
medication adherence and access."

 Dr. Shih is a long-term collaborator of ours and her work on patients with anorexia nervosa is a direct
extension of the parent grant (“Bioactive lipids as effectors and indicators of the deleterious effects of
environmental exposure on chronic diseases”). Dr. Shih’s proposed research directly relates and complements
to Goal 5 of the parent grant (Test the hypothesis that toxicity and disease states can be altered by
pharmacological intervention with and without nutritional intervention) and supports the NIEHS mission to
understand the regulatory functions of chemicals and the xenobiotic exposure on human health.
 Dr. Shih’s recent human subjects and epidemiological studies revealed several new findings relating to
how sEH and PUFA-derived bioactive lipids (oxylipins) are dysregulated in anorexia nervosa (AN) subjects.
The most intriguing finding was the opposite directional association with symptom severity when comparing n-
3-derived versus n-6-derived diols oxylipins. This finding reveals the need to clarify the role of oxylipins in
human health and how dietary nutrition affects them.
 Here-in, we are proposing to “marry” the expertise of an epidemiologist (Dr. Shih) to the data and
knowledge accumulated over the last 25 years in the Hammock laboratory to investigate the role of bioactive
lipids in heath and diseases through numerous animal studies and human subject data. Dr. Shih will conduct a
focused, multi-species analytical approach to meta-analyze data from the decades’ worth of research work in
the Hammock’s lab to effectively explore each oxylipin’s role in the context of disordered health. The meta-
analysis approach will remove the issue of limited power within individual studies, increase generalizability of
disorder-heath association, lessen assay-associated confounds, and generate new hypotheses.
 The completion of this research will yield high-confidence conclusions for the role of oxylipins in human
health and disorders. The unifying analytical methods and comparative study design will lead to discovery of
functional implications of metabolomic data that is critical for establishing clinical biomarkers of high validity
and reproducibility."

Extreme longevity (EL) is influenced by combinations of gene variants that may hold the explanation of why and
how many centenarians and their offspring reach extreme old ages with good cognitive function and delay or
even escape Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). In the last cycle of the Longevity Consortium
(LC), we established the LC Centenarian (LCC) project. By leveraging productive synergy within the LC and with
external collaborators, our genetic analyses identified new EL associated genes including genes that correlate
with protection from ADRD. We generated proteomic and metabolomic signatures of age, extreme old age, and
survival that revealed a snapshot of the complexity of molecular aging and EL, and we demonstrated that
longevity variants have distinct and well-replicated proteomic and metabolomic signatures that may help prioritize
targets for healthy aging therapeutics. These signatures include biomarkers of cognitive impairment (CI) and
ADRD. These results provide strong evidence for the hypothesis that genes related to EL, CI, and ADRD have
intertwined effects that we aim to dissect and characterize. We propose to conduct this work by augmenting our
existing collection of genome-wide genotype data with new multi-omics data, further our analyses of EL with new
genetic data, characterize genetic and associated multi-omics signatures that correlate with EL and protect
centenarians and their offspring from CI and ADRD, and examine the effects of sex, race and genetic diversity
on these associations. The LC is an ideal environment for these investigations by providing integration with
functional validation [Projects 2 and 5], additional cohorts of human aging [Project 1], and translational
opportunities [Project 4], further facilitated by the Integrative Analysis Core (IAC). The analyses in Project 3 will
clarify the relationships between factors related to EL and factors influencing CI and risk or severity of ADRD
and specifically address Objective 3 of the RFA: “Clarify the relationships between factors related to exceptional
longevity in humans and factors influencing cognitive function in old age and risk or severity of Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias”. We propose the following Project 3 specific aims: Aim 1 [Multi-phenotype/Multi-

phenotyping and expand the medical history data by linkage to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
data. Aim 2 [Genetics and Genomics Signatures of Extreme Longevity and Effect on ADRD/CI]: We will conduct
genetic/genomic analyses of EL to characterize the genetics and multi-omics profiles of EL and their effects on
the onset of CI and risk for ADRD. Aim 3 [Genetic and Genomic signatures of ADRD/CI protection and effect on
EL]: We will identify DNA fingerprints of ADRD and CI to clarify the effect of factors related to CI and risk or
severity of ADRD upon EL. Aim 4 [Race and Ethnicity Effects on EL/ADRD/CI Targets]: We will assemble data

11022981,"Project Summary: Integrative Analysis Core (IAC)
Longevity and age-related traits and diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are
multifactorial and ultimately influenced by many interacting genetic and non-genetic factors. This challenges the
identification of mechanisms that influence human lifespan and healthspan. Addressing this challenge requires
strategies to integrate and triangulate results from different studies. Such integration can lead to verification of a
finding, as well as placing a finding into a broader context to gain a deeper understanding of longevity related
physiology. The Integrated Analysis Core (IAC) of the Longevity Consortium (LC) will seek to integrate the results
of 5 different research projects (P1-P5), each addressing a key objective in the RFA: P1 studies diverse human
populations to determine the contexts within which longevity-related factors exhibit associations; P2 studies
genomically-mediated evolutionary processes contributing to longevity; P3 studies extreme longevity (EL) and
its relationship to ADRD in diverse human populations; P4 studies aging rate indicators in response to candidate
geroprotective drugs in mice; and P5 studies novel cell systems and constructs derived from individuals with EL
and other longevity related phenotypes. The IAC will seek to integrate results and data across these projects by
developing appropriate infrastructure and analytical methods and engaging in analyses with the project
researchers, including: 1. Developing connections, collaborations, and infrastructure to access data from
different sources to enhance P1-P5 research, and also work with the NIA-funded Data Management and
Coordinating Center’s (DMCC) Exceptional Longevity Translational Resources (ELITE) portal team to enable
broader access to relevant data sets; 2. Develop and apply methods for harmonizing data when needed,
accommodating heterogeneous data sets when harmonization is impossible, and dealing with the analysis of
complexities associated with large, diverse data sets; 3. Develop and apply systems biology and result
triangulation methods; 4. Develop strategies for leveraging genetics and genomics data to enhance cross
population comparisons via individual ancestry assignments, orthology determination to enable integration
across studies of different species, and genetic association studies involving complex phenotypes; and 5.
Coordinate and support a broad translational workflow leading from the identification of longevity-associated
factors to geroprotective drugs, drug targets, clinically meaningful biomarkers, and predictive models of health
and longevity."

Viruses are the etiological agents of a number of different human cancers. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a
ubiquitous pathogen infecting over 95% of the human population worldwide. EBV is the etiological agent of
several malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and multiple types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
including post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL), T cell
lymphomas, NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTL), and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). In addition, EBV is also associated
with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and gastric cancer.
There is an increased incidence of EBV-associated NHL in HIV-infected patients. HIV-positive individuals
have a 10–20% lifetime risk of developing Burkitt lymphoma and EBV-positive NKTL is seen with increased
frequency in HIV infection as well as transplant recipients. HIV-infected EBV-positive NKTL patients are also
at a higher risk for death when compared to NKTL patients without HIV.
We propose to understand how EBV is associated with multiple types of NHL in the HIV-infected population.
EBV is present in each and every lymphoma cell, which implies that EBV contributes to the initiation,
development, and maintenance of the tumor. Several of these EBV-associated lymphomas e.g. NKTL and
BL are highly aggressive and NKTL show resistance to chemotherapeutics. Hence, new therapies are needed
to target these NHL. We have found that EBV-associated NHL display high expression of a cell cycle whose
expression is upregulated following EBV infection of naïve B cells. We hypothesize that EBV activates this
kinase to drive tumor growth and survival. In this proposal, we aim to identify how EBV upregulates this kinase
and the viral genes that may be responsible for this phenomenon. We will investigate the mechanisms by
which EBV, a causal agent of human cancer, modulates cellular processes that contribute to the early events
in the carcinogenesis of EBV-associated lymphomas. We will also determine whether inhibiting this kinase
can hinder EBV-driven lymphomagenesis in vitro and in vivo, and we will investigate whether inhibitors of this
kinase can function as a novel therapeutic target to hinder the development and pathology of EBV-driven
lymphomas. The identification of novel therapeutic targets will help overcome the morbidity and mortality of
EBV-associated lymphomas around the globe and may also be relevant to non-viral cancers."

Early-onset spinal deformity is a subset of pediatric spinal deformity that begins before the age of 10 years.
Unlike adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, it is a life-threatening disease, which makes early intervention crucial.
Surgical intervention must accommodate the growth of the developing spine, making this one of the most
challenging orthopedic conditions to treat. Current intra-spinal based treatments, such as growing rods with
pedicle screw fixation, have high complication rates and limited effectiveness. The R-FIX (Rib-FIXation) Spinal
Growth System is an alternative extra-spinal technique that uses rib-based fixation for correcting early-onset
spinal deformity. This extra-spinal rib fixation is a paradigm shift from seeking correction of the spine to
emphasizing correction of thorax malalignment. The R-FIX System originated from a bioengineering lab (one of
the applicants' labs) at Clemson University and has been further developed by Apex Orthopaedic Technologies.
The R-FIX Spinal Growth System has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA. The objective
of this SBIR Phase II award is threefold: 1) complete the final design, manufacturing, and quality control
processes for the new R-FIX System components, 2) obtain the necessary biomechanical, biocompatibility, and
sterility data resulting in successful 510(k) clearance of the R-FIX System, and 3) demonstrate the safety and
efficacy of new R-FIX uni-axial rib hook and rib band designs in an animal model. This research will be conducted
over 24 months and the data obtained from this grant proposal will result in a 510(k) application for FDA
clearance and follow-up NIAMS pediatric medical device initiative clinical trial application. Major milestones to
be achieved with this grant include 1) validation of new implantable R-FIX components with surgeon feedback,
2) completion of benchtop performance testing and FDA 510(k) submission, and 3) assessment of the safety
and efficacy of new R-FIX components compared to pedicle screws in a pediatric hyperkyphosis porcine animal
model."

In this Direct to Phase II SBIR application, miRecule proposes to develop MC-30 an Antibody RNA Conjugate
(ARC), composed of the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab conjugated to a chemically modified mimic of the tumor
suppressor microRNA miR-30-5p. Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 6th most common
form of cancer worldwide. Greater than half of patients present with locoregionally advanced form of disease,
with an average 5-year survival rate of ~40%. Cetuximab is currently approved to treat this subset of patients
but only offers mild treatment benefit. This is partly due to EGFR targeted therapy often being compensated for
by overexpression of other growth factor receptors (GFRs) such as MET and IGF1R. However, we have
discovered that miR-30-5p simultaneously targets and repress all three of these GFRs. The rationale for miR-
30-5p replacement therapy is that it will be superior in its ability to treat heterogeneous late-stage HNSCC due
to its ability to regulate not only EGFR, but also MET, IGF-1R, and over two dozen other mRNAs confirmed to
be deregulated in tumor tissue and associated with proliferation, adhesion, migration, extracellular matrix
remodeling, and differentiation. MC-30 has three independent mechanisms of action, inhibition of EGFR
signaling and induction of ADCC by the cetuximab antibody component, and if the ARC is internalized
the RNA payload can suppress several oncogenic mechanisms and kill the cancer cell. We have
demonstrated in pre-clinical mouse models that MC-30 better than doubles tumor growth inhibition and
survival compared to cetuximab. We have also demonstrated that in preliminary toxicology studies that MC-
30 has a similar safety profile in mice and NHPs to the parent antibody. In this direct to phase 2 application we
will; 1) Validate MC-30 efficacy in diverse PDX and Syngeneic mouse models compared to standard of care. 2)
Execute process development and scale up of our MC-30 ARC and create a panel of CMC release tests for
GMP manufacturing. 3) PK Bioanalytical method tech transfer, and GLP validation for IND and Phase 1 studies.
4) Perform Non-GLP PK and maximum tolerated dose range finding studies in NHPs. Successful execution of
this proposal will finish our data package for our Pre-IND meeting with FDA, and subsequent initiation of IND
enabling studies."
11008882,"ABSTRACT. One in five liver patients on the transplant waitlist die before a new liver is found, while many more
patients are never listed but could benefit from liver replacement. While “bridge-to-transplant” technologies
(ventricular assist devices, dialysis) have transformed the outlook for heart and kidney failure, no such treatment
exists for patients with liver failure. Current liver sharing limits (about 500 miles) are based on short preservation
durations (6-10 hours). Extending preservation to a few days would enable nationwide donor-recipient matching,
allowing many livers that are not transplanted today (e.g., subsets of extended criteria donor livers have been
shown to offer substantial survival benefits) to be offered to the patients who most need them. Current standard
practice involves the vascular flush of livers with cold storage solution and subsequent transport on ice, to
maintain viability via hypothermic static storage. While research has shown that lower temperatures are needed
for viable, extended storage durations, storage of organs at or below 0°C risks ice formation (and significant
damage) within the organ. However, it is possible to supercool water-based solutions beyond 0°C while
remaining liquid in a metastable state. Published work from our group has shown that supercooling livers below
0°C can yield several fold increases in cold storage time. For example, simple supercooling has achieved 100%
survival after three days with storage at -6°C in a rat transplant model. While our group has also supercooled
and stored human livers at -4°C for a cumulative 27 hours, a significant improvement over current limitations in
cold ischemic storage (6-10 hours), further extending the storage duration or decreasing the storage temperature
pose additional challenges at this scale. The metastable nature of supercooled solutions can still result in
stochastic ice nucleation and damaging crystal growth, a risk which scales with increasing organ size. The
innovation here embodies development of novel techniques for a “next generation”, non-frozen preservation
paradigm, dubbed “Enhanced Supercooling”. This will enable practically stable ice-free storage of clinical-size
livers (pig and human) at high subzero temperatures (effective in nature but not yet studied extensively for human
organ preservation). For this direct to Phase 2 proposal, building on our successful Phase 1 equivalent work, in
partnership with Harvard/MGH and Johns Hopkins Univ, we develop methods for Enhanced Supercooling of
human size livers via: 1) exploration of strategies for longer duration, lower temperature supercooling via (i) air-
liquid interface sealing with immiscible oil, (ii) biocompatible synthetic ice modulators to inhibit heterogeneous
ice nucleation; 2) enhancement of subzero cooling for ice-free preservation by freezing point depression (FPD)
guided stable near equilibrium non-frozen storage, with biocompatible cryoprotective agents; 3) optimization of
enhanced supercooling and/or FPD in pig livers in a pilot study of 3-5day preservation with liver orthotopic
allotransplantation, and 4) validation of enhanced supercooling of human livers donated for research. Our goal
is to achieve ice free storage of supercooled clinical scale livers at -6 to -12°C, or lower, for more than 72 hours."
11008187,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The genome is a critical factor in our health. However, the cost and performance of current sequencing
technologies are limiting genomics from realizing its full potential in healthcare, including monitoring of cancer
development and recurrence. The goal of the project is to develop a revolutionary sequencing platform that is
superior to existing technologies across a range of metrics. Rather than reading one base or letter at a time, the
proposed technology reads short segments of sequence or “words”, by measuring the kinetics of short
oligonucleotide probe binding to their complementary sequence in the target using super-resolution fluorescence
imaging. Each nucleotide is read multiple times during sequencing. Super-resolution imaging enables the
sequencing of a high molecular density of targets. Advanced statistical and machine learning algorithms are used
for image processing, base calling and sequence assembly. Once developed, this platform will surpass existing
sequencing technology by one or more orders of magnitude in factors including accuracy and sequencing
cost. XGenomes’ prior work has validated the fundamental approach. This Phase I project will develop a full-stack
proof-of-concept through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will apply our experience to expand the probe set to the
96 we will require for demonstrating sequencing in Aim 3. In Aim 2, the bioinformatics pipeline will be fully
implemented and our prototype fluidics platform will be scaled up to deliver and image 96 probes. Finally, in Aim 3
we will construct the synthetic test targets and demonstrate Q50 sequencing of targeted variants of a clinically
relevant loci. The successful completion of these aims will prove the technology works and position XGenomes to
scale up to the complete platform."
11007304,"DEVELOPMENT OF A LUNG-CANCER SUBTYPING DIAGNOSTIC
Abstract
The overall goal of the proposed project will be to create a high sensitivity, high specificity subtyping test for lung
cancer. Lung cancer subtypes differ significantly in pathology, metastatic potential, therapy selection and
response. Lung cancer subtyping is critical for selecting the most effective treatment and thus reducing overall
mortality. This subtyping capability will be added to Orbit Genomics’ first lung cancer diagnostic test that is an
aid-to-diagnosis test for positive LDCTs with indeterminate pulmonary nodules. It distinguishes benign from
malignant pulmonary nodules with a prototype efficacy of 92% Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and 97%
Negative Predictive Value (NPV). Subtyping capability will markedly improve the value of the existing test which
is in validation trials now using samples from Drs. Yankelevitz and Henschke at the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mt. Sinai and is on a course to be launched as a Lab Developed Test (LDT) next year. Our first diagnostic test
will supplement LDCT imaging to achieve unprecedented overall diagnostic accuracies and should prevent
500,000 unnecessary biopsies in the US annually, saving $6 billion in procedural costs. The lung cancer
subtyping diagnostic test will expand the use of the test to all pulmonary nodules while providing
additional information needed for treatment, further reducing the need for biopsies and improving
patient outcomes while saving money. Clinical samples from Mt. Sinai with pathology determined lung cancer
subtypes were used to identify statistically significant subtype informative loci and subtype classification in
preliminary experiments. In previous publications we showed that an earlier version of our approach could
provide brain cancer subtyping information. In order to bring this novel lung cancer subtyping diagnostic test to
the market we will need to obtain subtype training samples (n=700, patient blood samples) from our existing and
expanded network of clinical collaborators (SA1); to upgrade microsatellite allelotyper/genotypers, our
informative loci selection and data mapping-to-image-space algorithms and train our new, novel AI Image-based
classifier on the exome sequences of samples with known subtypes (small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), non-
small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and its further subtypes (Squamous cell carcinoma; Adenocarcinoma; Large
cell carcinoma)) (SA2). While creating this new version of the test we will iteratively optimize SA1-2 performance
and then validate it (SA3) on independently obtained, pathologically well-characterized, clinically diagnosed
patient blood samples (n=200) analyzed in Orbit Genomics’ CLIA laboratory. Such a subtype capable diagnostic
test will be launched as an LDT, and will provide fast, accurate results to treating clinicians, ultimately saving
lives, patient suffering and money."
11007305,"The goal of this Phase 1 SBIR project is to develop and test a bidirectional synchronous flow-controlled
ventilation system to improve oxygenation and ventilation in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
Respiratory failure is a significant cause of mortality, leading to one million deaths annually worldwide1.
Respiratory pandemics are frequent and lead to profound mortality with conventional therapy alone.
Conventional ventilation (CV) induces and potentiates alveolar trauma through numerous well-established
mechanisms of ventilator-induced-lung-injury (VILI) including: volutrauma, barotrauma, and atelectatic-trauma.
We propose to develop a ventilation system that has a lower potential for trauma and reduced need for sedation
and paralysis. VENTSAFE™ has the potential to provide gentle lung ventilation without the damaging effects of
CV. Instead of artificially expanding and collapsing the lung, the system performs gas exchange at tightly
controlled, near-static pressures. VENTSAFE™ technology overcomes the shortcomings of existing high
frequency ventilation systems by employing a bidirectional synchronous flow-controlled ventilation system. Our
device allows for much higher frequencies than existing technologies creating a near-static low amplitude
pressure wave. Using a rudimentary device and a physical test system, along with results from computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) airflow analysis, we have preliminary data demonstrating that our system is able to deliver
bidirectional synchronous flow-controlled, ventilation from the Endotracheal tube inlet at a near-static pressure
while circumventing trauma that is common from conventional ventilators. This should translate into lower
sedation requirements and eliminate risk of breath stacking. We will test the hypothesis that a bidirectional
synchronous flow-controlled ventilation system will demonstrate improved oxygenation and ventilation in an
ARDS lung model. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct the following specific aims: Aim 1. Perform CFD
analysis. Milestone: Design demonstrates equivalent or improved ability to oxygenate and ventilate (simulated
expired CO2 and O2) compared to CV forces in a CFD lung model. Aim 2. Develop a robust experimental
prototype. Milestone: Device demonstrates ability to maintain and adjust mean airway pressure with the ability
to effectively clear CO2 on a physical lung model. Aim 3. Preclinical and benchtop test of VentSafe™
ventilation system in both native and damaged lung models compared to conventional ventilation.
Milestone: Demonstrate improved oxygenation (>5mmHG PaO2 increase) and improved ventilation (>5mmHG
PaCO2 decrease) with arterial blood gas analysis (ABG) at specific time intervals compared to convention
ventilation system (p<0.05). Acceptable lung tissue histology. At the conclusion of this Phase 1 SBIR we seek
to have a validated, robust experimental prototype that has demonstrated improved ability to oxygenate and
ventilate in ARDS compared to conventional ventilation. In Phase 2 we intend to develop a scalable, market-
ready prototype for statistically significant modeling to justify moving to the clinic."
11009306,"Fentanyl and its analogues are increasingly responsible for drug overdose deaths in the United States and
worldwide. As a potent µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, fentanyl is anticipated to exacerbate the pathobiology
of neuroHIV and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) via complex mechanisms involving direct
peripheral and CNS effects. Unlike typical opioids, fentanyl appears to also target non-opioid receptors causing
chest wall muscle rigidity, laryngospasm, and rapid death, and pronounced neuroimmune dysregulation. Our
preliminary data show that non-opioid receptor targets, especially α1-, α2-, and possibly β-adrenergic receptors
(ARs), widely expressed by astroglia in the striatum, are critical for the unique pathophysiologic effects of
fentanyl. We find that acute fentanyl (i) exposure differentially alters the firing rates of dopamine receptor D1-
and D2-expressing (D1 and D2) medium spiny neurons (MSNs), while sustained exposure (ii) nearly eliminates
spontaneous activity in MSNs if co-cultured with astroglia and (iii) increases inflammatory chemokines and
oxyradicals, and that (iv) many of fentanyl's sustained effects are likely mediated by α1AR-expressing astro-
and microglia. Xylazine, an α2AR agonist, which is increasingly combined with fentanyl to create “tranq”, is
highly excitotoxic to MSNs in mixed glial co-cultures and appears to have much more severe pathophysiologic
effects in neuroHIV models than the prototypical opioid morphine, or than fentanyl alone. We hypothesize
that, in addition to its effects at MORs and unlike typical opioids, fentanyl exacerbates HIV-induced
MSN dysfunction and injury through actions at αARs and that its unique pathological effects are
mediated by α1AR-, α2AR- (especially with xylazine), but not β2AR-, expressing astro- and microglia.
This hypothesis will be tested in the following Aims: Aim 1 will identify the MOR-, α1 and α2AR, and βAR
mechanisms by which fentanyl (with some comparisons to morphine) and Tat and infectious and replicative-
deficient HIV cause D1 and D2 MSN excitotoxicity and synaptodendritic injury in vitro. The role of MORs,
α1ARs, and α2ARs will be assessed in studies of MSN-mixed-glial co-cultures and human MSN iPSCs using
confocal microscopy and whole-cell and perforated-patch physiologic approaches. Aim 2 will determine the
MOR- and α1 and α2-AR mechanisms by which fentanyl and HIV interact to disrupt D1 and D2 MSN
synaptodendritic structure and function in control and Tat tg mice in vivo and using whole-cell neurophysiologic
approaches in ex vivo slices. Aim 3 will determine the MOR- and α1 and α2AR mechanisms by which fentanyl
and xylazine (“tranq”) combinations and Tat/HIV interact to disrupt D1 and D2 MSN synaptodendritic structure
and function in vitro and in vivo/ex vivo. This project will systematically explore and compare novel interactions
of fentanyl with HIV using well-established models used previously to characterize the effects of the
prototypical MOR-agonist opioid morphine in neuroHIV. If confirmed, our findings will establish a conceptual
framework for understanding how fentanyl, its synthetic analogues and xylazine impact neuroHIV."

In the United States, over 5 million children have experienced the incarceration of a parent—a consequence of
five decades of mass incarceration, which is a manifestation of structural racism. Policies and practices driving
mass incarceration children who are Black have a seven times higher likelihood of experiencing parental
incarceration than their white peers. Parental incarceration is associated with worse child mental health,
including internalizing (e.g. depression, suicidal ideation) and externalizing (e.g. aggression, substance use)
behaviors, and it contributes to disparities in child mental health. Housing insecurity is one form of economic
hardship disproportionately experienced by families who have been impacted by incarceration. Housing
insecurity is associated with more child and adolescent mental health problems including internalizing and
externalizing symptoms, particularly for families impacted by the criminal legal system. The overall research
goal of this supplement is to build evidence on how structural interventions, specifically an intervention to
improve housing stability, affects child mental health among those whose parents have been incarcerated. We
will build upon the infrastructure of the TRUsted rEsidents and Housing Assistance to decrease Violence
Exposure in New Haven (TRUE HAVEN) grant, a multi-level intervention focused on housing stability and
mental well-being, to describe and explore potential changes in youth mental health among TRUE HAVEN
housing intervention participants. Specifically, we will embed a qualitative study and a cohort feasibility study of
youth and their parents within the ongoing hybrid type 1 effectiveness/implementation study of an intervention
that provides comprehensive financial education and financial support for housing in the form of rental
assistance, down payment assistance, and low-interest home loans among family members of incarcerated
people. The proposed aims are a logical extension of the parent project aims and add a novel exploration of
the impact of TRUE HAVEN on parent-child relationships and on youth mental health. Further, this supplement
will provide Dr. Destiny Tolliver with necessary skills to build an independent research career."

The University of Kentucky (UK) proposes to significantly advance its secure research data infrastructure
capacity within the Enterprise Data Center (EDC), an integral component of the Kentucky Center for Clinical
and Translational Science (CCTS). The CCTS currently supports more than $34.1 million in annual direct cost
grant funding to support biomedical and population health projects with significant needs for secure research
data infrastructure, including HIPAA-compliant data management and storage. Unprecedented advances in
research computing and data capabilities are revolutionizing biomedical research and transforming discoveries
in these research domains. New computationally and data-driven research approaches such as artificial
intelligence, machine learning, omics, data mining and analytics, as well as computationally based simulations
and modeling are enabling bold new directions in biomedical research and drawing in entirely new biomedical
investigators whose studies are increasingly computationally based. Critical research data needs at UK reside
in prominent NIH-supported centers, including the Markey Cancer Center, the Alzheimer’s Disease Research
Center within the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, and the Center on Drug and Alcohol Research, as well as
within a wide array of individual NIH-funded researchers. Burgeoning needs have placed critical demands on
the EDC to accommodate increased numbers of users, greater amounts of high-speed data storage, and
greater demand for high performance computing infrastructure. The proposed facilities expansion will expand
the 352 sq. ft. EDC, UK’s only HIPAA-secure data center (HITRUST Certification) by merging two vacant
adjacent rooms to create a secure 1,155 sq. ft. data center and ADA-compliant entry corridor and provide
requisite cooling, electrical distribution, and communication infrastructure to support the purchase and
installation of 28 additional racks of high-density, high-performance computing equipment through university
resources. The goal of the proposed 1,231 sq. ft. facilities renovation is to address a critical shortage of secure
biomedical research data center space at UK by more than tripling EDC capacity to accommodate
exponentially rising biomedical research volume and associated data infrastructure. The proposed expansion
is consistent with overarching UK priorities to support rapid advances in clinical and translation discovery
through enhanced capacity for secure, HIPAA-compliant data infrastructure and to continue to meet rapidly
expanding demand presented by NIH-funded researchers involved in data-intensive biomedical and population
health research. The proposed facilities expansion project is closely aligned with NIH priorities for data
management and sharing and embeds clear national impact by meeting those priorities."

11013480,"1 Gonorrhea affects over 80 million individuals globally, annually. Over 700,000 cases were reported to the CDC
 2 in 2021, a relentless rise since 2009. Women suffer the most serious consequences of this disease, including
 3 pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and infertility. The etiologic agent, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng)
 4 has become resistant to almost every antibiotic in clinical use. The emergence of ceftriaxone-resistant isolates
 5 in all regions of the world portends an era of untreatable gonorrhea. There is no licensed vaccine against
 6 gonorrhea. Thus, safe and effective preventive measures are urgently needed. Ng evade killing by complement
 7 (C’) by sialylating its lipooligosaccharide (LOS), which results in recruitment of the C’ inhibitor, factor H (FH). To
 8 exploit this virulence mechanism, we fused the Ng-binding fragment of FH (that lacks C’ inhibitory activity) to the
 9 C-terminus of human IgG3 Fc to produce Fc3/FH*. Fc3/FH* killed all 46 Ng isolates that expressed the PorB1B
10 allele of the major outer membrane porin B (PorB) protein in a C’-dependent bactericidal assay, and diminished
11 the duration and burden of Ng in the mouse vaginal colonization model. However, Fc3/FH was bactericidal
12 against only 2 of 15 Ng strains that expressed the PorB1A allele. Although responsible for only a minority of
13 infections, PorB1A isolates have a relatively high propensity to disseminate through the bloodstream. To reliably
14 cover PorB1A isolates, we will create a novel bispecific mAb where the C-terminus of FH will be fused to an anti-
15 LOS mAb called 2C7. mAb 2C7 recognizes an epitope distinct from LOS sialic acid, which is critical for Fc3/FH
16 binding. Further, mAb 2C7 binds independently of the PorB allele expressed. The 2C7 LOS epitope is critical for
17 Ng colonization, and therefore expressed by >95% of Ng in vivo. A chimeric version of mAb 2C7 shows C’-
18 dependent killing of all minimally passaged Ng tested and attenuates mouse vaginal colonization by both PorB1A
19 and PorB1B Ng. The advantages of the bispecific 2C7/FH* mAb include: 1) broad activity against PorB1A and
20 PorB1B Ng; 2) a substantially raised threshold for the development of drug-resistance by targeting two distinct
21 epitopes and virulence factors; and 3) reduced cost of production compared to producing two separate molecules
22 – a critical consideration for Ng therapeutics because gonorrhea rates are highest among socio-economically
23 underprivileged and marginalized populations and in low- and middle-income countries. In Aim 1, we will produce
24 four bispecific mAbs that contains FH domains 19-20 or domain 20 alone fused to the C-terminus of either the
25 heavy or light chain of chimeric mAb 2C7. A 6-month accelerated stability study will be carried out on the
26 bispecifics. In Aim 2, we will compare the efficacy of the four bispecifics in vitro using C’-dependent bactericidal
27 assays against a small panel of Ng isolates. The most effective lead molecule will be tested against a broader
28 panel of Ng isolates to confirm breadth of coverage. In Aim 3, in vivo efficacy of the lead candidate against
29 PorB1A and PorB1B Ng will be established in the mouse vaginal colonization model using transgenic mice that
30 express the C’ inhibitors FH and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) to better simulate a human-like C’ environment."
11013481,"Spotted Fever group Rickettsia are the etiologic agents of astoundingly dangerous acute bacterial infections
like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Rickettsia parkeri rickettsiosis and Murine Typhus. Once transmitted to a
human by an infected arthropod, the intracellular Rickettsia grow within the endothelial lining of blood vessels.
Within a few days of infection, the bacteria parasitize the entire vascular system causing vascular leakage,
hypovolemia and pervasive multiorgan failure. While rapid diagnosis and treatment with the single applicable
antibiotic has improved overall prognosis, this strategy has only decreased fatality rates to 5-10% of cases.
 The Rickettsia have evolved the ability to “steal” and coat the bacterial surface with the mammalian
complement regulator Factor H (FH) so that the complement system loses the ability to efficiently detect and
attack the pathogen. On a molecular level, this interaction involves a bacterial surface protein and a common
“bacteria-association” region of FH called short consensus repeats 19-20 (SCR19-20). We are developing
proteins that fuse SCR19-20 to the fragment crystallizable region (Fc) of human IgG3. So, when the bacteria try
to “steal” FH using SCR19-20, they do not acquire the complement-protective properties of FH. Instead, these
bacteria are coated with IgG3 Fc which results in activation of a plethora of immunoprotective mechanisms,
including complement activation, FcR-mediated phagocytosis, steric inhibition and antibody-dependent
intracellular neutralization. This novel strategy for anti-infective development is the foundation of our proposal.
 We have already demonstrated that multiple Rickettsia species bind our immunotherapeutic fusion protein,
Fc3/SCR(19-20), and this interaction leads to a severe reduction in bacterial viability. Using the current protein
Fc3/SCR(19-20) as a foundation, we will generate additional protein variants designed to decrease off-target
host binding, increase phagocytosis and harness antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization. These proteins
will be produced using our proprietary expression platform and extensively purified. Fc3/SCR(19-20) and all new
derivatives will be examined for complement activation, complement-mediated killing, opsonophagocytosis by
macrophages and interaction with the intracellular antibody sensor TRIM21. Those proteins that possess the
greatest potential will be further examined for protective capacity in small animal models of Rickettsia infection.
Completion of this Phase I proposal will result in a lead compound that possess the desired antimicrobial

During HIV-1 infection, the viral membrane fuses with the host cell membrane to deliver the HIV-1 virus to the
host cell cytoplasm. Once within the host cell, HIV-1 must move to the nucleus so that the viral DNA generated
by reverse transcription can be incorporated into the host genome. The host microtubule network and the
microtubule-associated motor dynein support infection by facilitating HIV-1 transport to the nucleus. This
proposal aims to determine how HIV-1 exploits the dynein machinery during transit to the nucleus. Dynein
cannot walk on microtubules unless bound to a class of proteins called adaptors. In addition to activating
dynein, adaptors also link dynein to cargo. Previously, it was hypothesized that HIV-1 bound to the adaptor
BicD2 to hijack the dynein motor. We used single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)
microscopy to reconstitute HIV-1 motility via dynein. Unexpectedly, we found HIV-1 cores bind to dynein
directly, unlike host-derived cargoes that require an adaptor to bind to the dynein motor. We also found that
HIV-1 cores can “hijack” and move with dynein motors bound to many divergent adaptors. Attaching directly to
the dynein motor is likely a viral adaptation that ensures HIV-1 can exploit multiple dynein cargo adaptors for
motility in situ. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis of the dynein-mediated trafficking of
HIV-1 so that we can eventually develop tools that disrupt the translocation of HIV-1 to the host nucleus
without affecting native host trafficking. To facilitate this goal, we have developed the following Aims. In Aim 1,
we will use the TIRF-based motility assay we developed to determine how HIV-1 recruits and activates
retrograde motility via dynein and associated adaptors. We will also determine if HIV-1 hitchhiking on dynein-
cargo complexes affects normal dynein-mediated cargo trafficking. In Aim 2, we will use single particle cryo-
EM and cryo-electron tomography of dynein-HIV-1 complexes assembled in vitro to determine the binding site
of dynein on the HIV-1 capsid lattice. Biochemical studies in our lab suggest that dynein has two binding sites
for HIV-1: the heavy chain dimerization domain and the intermediate/light chains. We will characterize this
interaction using individual components bound to HIV-1 capsid in addition to cryo-electron tomography of
dynein-HIV-1 complexes on microtubules in vitro. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the cargo adaptors that
HIV-1 exploits in T-cells and determine if flexible use of dynein cargo adaptors facilitates replication in other
cell types. These Aims will show how HIV-1 utilizes a direct interaction with dynein as a flexible platform to
navigate the cytoplasm to the host cell nucleus. These experiments will continue to expand our understanding
of early steps in HIV-1 replication by providing a framework to understand how HIV-1 reaches the host cell
nucleus."

HIV-1 presents a severe global health challenge. Due to the high genetic variability of HIV and the lifelong
duration of the standard treatment, resistant mutations pose an acute challenge. As such, understanding the
mechanisms of resistance is crucial for the rational design of antivirals. The current approach for
understanding drug resistance focuses on identifying important interactions in the protein-drug complex based
on intuitions. These insights have led to intriguing structure-based drug design strategies. However,
resistance for drugs designed by these strategies readily developed, reflecting their limitations. This is due to
two major gaps in the current approach: (1) It does not consider the conformational dynamics inherent to
ligand binding, which are vital to decoding drug resistance. For example, the interplay between active-site
and non-active site mutations in PR cannot be understood from structures alone. (2) This empirical, qualitative
approach lacks a rigorous method to quantify how different residues and interactions individually and
collectively contribute to binding affinity. We propose to fill these two gaps with a physics-based rigorous
approach centered on protein conformational dynamics that control ligand binding, the process at the heart
of drug potency and resistance. We will leverage a novel method we developed for identifying the exact
reaction coordinates, the few essential coordinates of a protein that control its conformational dynamics and
ligand binding. We will develop a rigorous method for decomposing the ligand binding free energy into
contributions from individual residue-residue interactions. This method will enable us to identify residues and
interactions critical for drug resistance. We will apply it to HIV-1 protease inhibitors, aiming to elucidate the
mechanisms of resistance. We will also develop protocols for adjusting protein-protein and protein-ligand
interactions to manipulate protein dynamics and combat drug resistance. To verify our understanding of
resistance mechanisms and protocols for manipulating protein interactions and dynamics, we will test two
types of computational predictions in infection assays. 1) We will design mutations that confer stronger
resistance than current variants, aiming to establish the limits of drug resistance. 2) We will introduce
additional mutations to existing mutants to neutralize their resistance, aiming to establishing the range for
countering resistance. These will be achieved through two specific aims. The goal of this project is to develop
a computational toolkit for rigorously and systematically dissecting protein drug resistance mechanisms that
will enable rationale design of effective counterstrategies and validate it with virology assays. The insights
from this project will fuel our long-term goal: to design the next-generation HIV antivirals that not only
neutralize current resistant mutants but also minimize chances of new resistant mutations."

Despite decades of effort to reduce racial cancer disparities, Black people continue to die at higher rates from
cancer than any other U.S. racial group. Because prevention is the key to the cost-effective and long-term control
of cancer, the potential for cancer genetic counseling to play a central role in reducing racial cancer disparities
is high. However, the benefits of genetic counseling are not equitable across race. The overarching goal of this
proposed research is to compare and contrast the nature of genetic counseling encounters and patient-centered
outcomes between Black and White patients in the naturalistic clinical setting. Only 2% of genetic counselors
self-identify as Black/African American, so most genetic counseling encounters with Black patients are racially
discordant. Patients in racially discordant medical interactions tend to have poorer quality patient-provider
communication and receive suboptimal clinical recommendations. One major factor that contributes to these
racial healthcare disparities is racial bias. Drawing on findings from prior research, we hypothesize that genetic
counselor providers’ greater implicit racial prejudice will be associated with poorer patient-provider
communication, while providers’ explicit negative racial stereotypes will be associated with less comprehensive
clinical discussion of cancer risk and genetic testing for Black (vs. White) patients. These disparities in
encounters will be further associated with poorer patient-centered outcomes. We will test our hypotheses by
addressing four specific aims: Aim 1) to compare/contrast the nature of patient-provider communication by
patient race (Black or White); Aim 2) to compare/contrast the clinical discussion content by patient race; Aim 3)
to quantify the role of each type of counselor bias in patient-provider communication (Aim 1) and clinical
discussion content (Aim 2); and Aim 4) to quantify the role of patient-provider communication/ clinical discussion
content with patient-centered outcomes (trust, satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, empowerment, genetic testing
uptake). These aims will be achieved through an observational study with a convergent mixed methods research
design. We will analyze recorded cancer genetic counseling encounters both qualitatively and quantitatively,
linking those data to data from pre- and post-encounter surveys and medical chart reviews. With COVID-19,
many genetic counseling encounters have moved to telehealth, and telehealth is expected to continue to thrive
beyond the pandemic. The proposed study will embrace this unique, transitional opportunity and addresses the
overarching goal in the naturalistic clinical setting through multiple modalities (in-person, telehealth). Findings
from this multi-center study will highlight specific aspects of cancer genetic counseling encounters (patient-
provider communication and clinical recommendations) that are directly associated with patient-centered
outcomes. Patient-provider communication and clinical recommendations are modifiable factors, and they are
already being taught in genetic counseling training programs; thus, the findings can have immediate impact on
genetic counseling training and practice."

Koronis Biomedical Technologies Corporation (KBT) proposes to develop and validate a novel cognitive
intervention to support informal caregivers and family of individuals living with MCI or AD/ADRD and
other cognitive impairments to preserve functional independence and reduce caregiver burden for in-
home care. As the number of older Americans has grown, so has the prevalence of aging-associated
diseases, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which may stabilize or progress to Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), the most prevalent dementia, and other related dementias (ADRD). The majority of
persons living with dementia live at home, where they receive the majority of their care from informal
caregivers and unpaid individuals such as family members, friends, and neighbors. Informal caregivers
provide services with enormous economic value, replacing or delaying institutionalization at significant
personal cost. Families and informal caregivers of persons living with MCI and AD/ADRD have an unmet
need for an affordable cognitive intervention that can help the care recipient preserve cognition, maintain
independence, and assist in their own care. The proposed research seeks to address this need by
building an in-home cognition training system that provides a modular series of short, easy-to-follow,
evidence-based cognitive training activities that slow the course of AD/ADRD, prevent the onset, and
reduce the burden. The system will employ a novel caregivers/care recipient training model that views
caregiver and family involvement as a critical component of the intervention process. In this model,
caregivers and family can cooperatively (and remotely) work to make the training activities person-
centered, monitor performance status, and increase positive interaction by emphasizing shared history
and the care recipients' preserved capabilities rather than their limitations. In Phase I, KBT will develop a
collaborative reminiscence therapy module, allowing caregivers to curate anecdotes and media (photos,
audio, video) to personalize the therapy. KBT will also prototype the caregiver portal and application
interfaces, which will be evaluated in a human usability assessment."

Addressing the complexities of brain function and disorders at the cellular and molecular level
requires a spatial omics technology, capable of mapping the 3D distribution of specific
cell markers within tissue at the subcellular scale. While spatial proteomics technologies
have revolutionized in situ molecular profiling of tissues, limitations in resolution, epitope
accessibility, sample degradation, and 3D imaging capability have hindered their widespread
impact. This is the focus of our project, which proposes to combine two groundbreaking
microscopy technologies, pan-Single Step Expansion Microscopy (pan-SSExM) and
FLASH-PAINT, into a revolutionary new method named pan-OptiX S3D. Our optimized
pan-SSExM protocol offers tunable physical sample expansion between 1.5-fold and 8-fold
linearly, while retaining the proteome for subsequent labeling. FLASH-PAINT, on the other hand,
allows rapid and unlimited 3D multiplexed protein labeling without any sample damage. By
synergizing these technologies, pan-OptiX S3D promises subcellular and multicolor optical
imaging, in 3D, across whole tissue sections, with no label limitations due to degradation or
steric hindrance. Panluminate, Inc. is a leading company in the Spatial Biology and Tissue
Expansion fields. Our proposed project aims to develop pan-OptiX S3D and validate it in rodent
brain tissue to enable analysis of neural networks and pathologies in the brain. We specifically
propose to (1) develop novel FLASH probes specifically designed for compatibility with 5-fold
tissue expansion imaging, and (2) automate sample expansion and microfluidics multiplexing
with 3D microscopy and software integration. Ultimately, the developments proposed here will
enable panluminate to disseminate pan-OptiX S3D sample preparation and imaging to every
research and biotech lab around the world."
11007367,"Abstract: Advanced neurosurgery techniques are increasingly delivering life-changing therapies, and even
cures, for a range of serious and life-threatening conditions. Neurosurgeons using minimally invasive surgery
(MIS) techniques with MRI and CT guidance can ablate epileptic foci and place FDA-approved devices such as
deep brain stimulators (DBS), all with sub-mm accuracy. Intraoperative imaging is guiding intraparenchymal
administration of gene therapies in NIH trials of brain cancer and PD treatments. Cures for rare pediatric genetic
diseases are on the cusp of using guided gene therapies. However, effective placement of these tiny devices
and leads, as well as effective drug delivery, are held back by significant technical challenges.
Neurosurgeons typically use MRI for pre-surgical planning and post-surgery validation. They clearly see it as
enabling minimally invasive ablations for epilepsy or recurring tumors. But despite MRI’s transformative
intraoperative abilities, it is seen as too complex and time-consuming by many neurosurgeons with already
pressing surgical schedules. Leading neurosurgeons cite the lengthy workflow for catheter guidance within the
scanner bore as a barrier to MRI-guided neurointerventions. The leading MRI trajectory guide requires multiple
complex steps. Aligning the trajectory to hit a brain target requires multiple iterations of MRI acquisitions and
device manipulations, requiring 6-14 highly trained personnel per procedure. The time to achieve alignment is
quite variable, so the workflow is unpredictable.
Our Phase I project demonstrated the innovation of a quantized, indexed device guide, which we term AccuGyd.
The main innovation of AccuGyd is that by using a discrete indexing system, a brain location can be targeted
with greater accuracy than is needed. This opens the door to design a much smaller and less complex device.
AccuGyd requires only one MRI acquisition to determine its 3D orientation. Software uses that orientation and
the desired brain target point to determine which of AccuGyd’s ~20,000 supported indexed trajectories is closest
to the brain target point. Without further imaging, the software calculates which of several different cassettes,
each with a guide shaft at a different angle, should be inserted into the AccuGyd base. The software outputs a
second parameter, an indexed rotation, that aligns the guide with excellent accuracy for device positioning (<0.5
mm at 12 cm depth). Our Phase I innovation proved a brain guide could be rapidly aligned with only one image
acquisition. Phase II innovation centers on opportunities discovered in formal customer interviews: 1) radically
simplify fixation of the guide relative to the skull; 2) automate computation of AccuGyd’s 3D orientation; and 3)
create CT compatibility. The Phase II will culminate in an efficient surgical workflow and regulatory planning for
FDA 510(k) application. AccuGyd can significantly lower the barrier for image guided procedures, improving
capacity for emerging treatments."

 The goal of this Direct to Phase II SBIR proposal is continue development of Nirrin’s proprietary tunable
laser spectrometry system in preparation for commercialization. Biomanufacturing at commercial scale requires
precise monitoring of product components, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) such as proteins,
peptides, and nucleic acids, but also supporting excipients which are essential for overall safety and efficacy.
Process errors can lead to incorrect concentrations of APIs and excipients leading to extremely costly process
revisions and millions of dollars of waste in the form of adulterated product. Ensuring that biomanufacturing
processes remain consistent and compliant with FDA mandates regarding product composition is of urgent
importance to the biopharmaceutical industry. Methods which allow continuous real-time monitoring of product
components and support reliable, accurate and precise measurements are therefore of extremely high value.
Currently manufacturers rely on detailed process documentation to ensure product integrity and protocol
adherence, as well as end-point analysis using HPLC, mass spectrometry, or Raman spectrometry, among other
costly, time-consuming methods. None of these technologies are compatible with rapid, real-time analysis,
supporting only end-point analysis after full commercial-scale batches of product are generated. In fact, many
analytical methods require samples to be sent to contractors with data coming back after multiple days or even
weeks. Nirrin Technologies, Inc. has developed the NXT platform, a rapid and sensitive instrument for the
simultaneous analysis of biopharmaceutical APIs and excipients from a single sample with zero up-front sample
preparation. The system relies on tunable laser spectrometry, scanning samples across multiple wavelengths
and compiling absorbance spectra unique to the given analyte. Absorbance spectra have been developed and
validated for dozens of biopharmaceutical API’s and excipients and can be rapidly analyzed via Nirrin’s
straightforward software user interface. The NXT workflow has been evaluated by multiple biopharmaceutical
companies and satisfies many of the key product requirements which competing technologies do not. During
this Direct to Phase II program, we will optimize the design of the NXT system and fabricate 6 beta systems prior
to internal quality testing. Testing batteries will also be undertaken to satisfy the requirements for global
commercialization, including UL and CE marking. Systems will then be prepared for external validation testing
with at least three major biopharmaceutical companies. These activities are expected to dramatically accelerate
the commercialization of Nirrin’s tunable laser spectroscopy products while reducing manufacturing errors prior
to the launch of new biopharmaceuticals."

Lithium-based batteries have reached a technological limit of ~0.6 cc for use in leadless cardiac pacemaker
(LCP) applications and a useful life of only 7-10 years1. The 0.6 cc volume comprises over 60% of the
LCP’s total volume and is a technological miniaturization limit to LCPs. City Labs is developing a small
betavoltaic power source with sufficient current density to power a pulse generator circuit. The battery’s
volume can be as small as 0.1 cc, while providing a consistent ≥3.8 μW for 20 years. This size reduction
would allow for an LCP to be implanted in the atria, permitting multi-chamber leadless pacing for patients
previously relegated to conventional pacemakers. Furthermore, a decrease in size grants both the
manufacturer of delivery catheters and the clinicians operating them a higher degree of flexibility, both in
developing the device design process and implantation protocol, even permitting multiple LCPs in a single
chamber. A longer-lived pacemaker also expands the potential use of LCPs to younger demographics.
LCPs’ retrieval is difficult, so they are often used in patients who are not projected to outlive the device2,3.
We will be designing and manufacturing a polyimide-based package that will be biocompatible and safe. It
will fit in a leadless pacemaker’s titanium housing, providing double encapsulation. The project goal is to
make the most reliable polyimide device configuration and manufacturing approach for transition to market
approval with the pacemaker manufacturing partner. We propose a research and development optimization
of industrial production methods necessary to ensure consistent and controlled scale-up manufacturing
according to recognized quality standards and FDA requirements. City Labs has developed and utilized
helium generation and leak models for the predictive design of packaging and components indicative of
measured values. Model and measured data will undergo rigorous tuning and analysis under this CRP to
ensure adequate predictability and tolerance for diffusion rates in a polyimide package. Furthermore, all
packages will be tested to ensure they meet the designed leak rate. The final optimization of the prototype
entails the sealing of end caps, feedthroughs, wall thickness, and leak rates associated with components
and sealing processes. We will quantify the component and sealing process leak rates with a helium leak
detector. This will enable us to produce a package, with controlled hermeticity and minimized volume, from
components fabricated in-house, like additively manufactured end caps and specialized electrical contacts.
To fabricate and seal such polyimide components, we will acquire and customize an advanced 3-D printer
capable of manipulating high performance thermoplastics. The CRP effort will support development needed
to harmonize the modeling, prototyping, and manufacturing processes. This project aims to develop the
manufacturing capability and commercialization maturity our pacemaker manufacturing partners require."
11009395,"Even with active antiretroviral therapy, some children living with HIV develop neurocognitive deficits and
show neurodevelopmental delays. This can affect their ability to read, form relationships, and find productive
employment. Detecting HIV-associated central nervous system (CNS) effects early, and following their
progress reliably, is critical for studying, assessing, and treating this disabling HIV co-morbidity—particularly in
the lower- and middle- income countries where most cases exist and resources are limited. We have been
tracking literacy development and cognitive performance longitudinally in a cohort of children living with and
without HIV (CLWH/CLWOH) in Dar es Salaam Tanzania. The focus is determining if tests of central auditory
function (i.e., tests of the brain’s ability to process complex sounds) are associated with, or predict, the
development of literacy, behavioral problems, and neurocognitive abilities. Results show that CLWH have
worse neurocognitive performance, poorer literacy skills, and more behavioral problems on average than their
non-infected age and socioeconomic status matched peers. Interestingly, central auditory test performance
correlates with literacy and neurocognitive outcomes. Children who consistently perform better than their peers
in detecting speech in background noise are more likely to read earlier than those who do not. Similarly,
children with poor central auditory performance also have worse performance on cognitive tests of memory,
attention, and processing speed. These results support our previous work showing that performance on tasks
assessing the central auditory system correlate with tests of neurocognitive abilities. These longitudinal results
suggest the tests might be predictive, where a central auditory test at a young age might help predict the
subsequent development of literacy and at a later age. Children entered the current study at ages 3-8, now
they will be entering adolescence. A key question is whether these tests might predict critical life outcomes
such as school performance, mental health, and quality of life. Very few studies exist that follow CLWH into
adolescence when CLWH take more responsibility for their care. This renewal will show how auditory tests
relate to educational outcomes, mental health, and quality of life in a well-studied cohort of CLWH/CLWOH as
they progress into adolescence. We have assembled an international team with experience in central auditory,
neurocognitive, and neuropsychological testing. Dr. Nina Kraus and her team at Northwestern are
internationally recognized experts in auditory electrophysiology. The Dar es Salaam team has extensive
experience in performing both central auditory and neurocognitive tests and managing large-scale studies. Dr.
Jonathan Lichtenstein is expert in assessing neurocognitive function and developmental delays in children.
Together this team will track educational, mental health, and quality of life outcomes in CLWH and determine
the role central auditory testing could play in predicting or assessing the neurocognitive effects of HIV infection.
These tests may offer a new and improved way to assess critical life outcomes in adolescents living with HIV."
11009396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advertising of unhealthy foods and beverages to adolescents has been consistently recognized as a prominent
negative determinant of child health, shaping risk for diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Social media ads are
particularly concerning given adolescents aged 13-18 years spend nearly 3 hours per day on social media
platforms and see upwards of 17 food ads per hour. Black and Hispanic adolescents and lower income
adolescents report spending more time on social media and are targeted more for ads overall, making
understanding these dynamics important for addressing diet-related disparities. Up to this point, regulating
advertising has been difficult in the United States, owing to court rulings that recognize companies’ ability to
advertise as part of their First Amendment right to free speech in the US Constitution. However, a new path
has emerged whereby states, led initially by Utah and followed by Louisiana, Texas, and others, have passed
policies restricting anyone younger than 18 years from accessing social media without explicit parental
approval. Some of these policies also restrict companies’ ability to market to adolescents on social media sites.
We will study the influence of these policies on adolescents’ exposure to food and beverage advertising in
Louisiana, (policy starts August 1st, 2024), and Texas (policy starts September 1st, 2024). We will enroll
adolescents aged 13-17 years in Texas and Louisiana (two diverse states among the first to pass these laws),
matched with comparison adolescents from states that do not have similar policies in place at the time of our
study. We will utilize a proven yet innovative screen capture procedure to allow for as comprehensive as
possible determination of youth’s full social media and online advertising exposure.
 Aim 1: Determine whether the social media policies in Texas and Louisiana reduce adolescents’
exposure to unhealthy food and beverage advertising online.
H1: The policies will reduce online exposure to unhealthy food and beverage advertising for
adolescents living in Texas and Louisiana versus a matched comparison sample.
Aim 2: With a focus on disparities, determine whether lower income adolescents have a differential
response to the policy than higher income adolescents.
H2: The reduction in number of ads seen will be greater for lower income adolescents than for higher
income adolescents.
Aim 3: With a focus on disparities, determine whether Black and Hispanic adolescents have differential
responses to the policy than White adolescents.
H3: The reduction in number of ads seen will be greater for Black and Hispanic adolescents than for
White adolescents."

Chromosome gains and losses are found in nearly all human cancers. However, the functional importance of
these massive gene dosage imbalances remains poorly understood. Notably, large chromosomal segments are
technically challenging to manipulate, which has limited our ability to precisely model and interrogate the
consequences of specific aneuploidies. The relationship between aneuploidy and cancer development is of
particular importance for individuals with Trisomy 21/Down syndrome, as children with this condition exhibit a
150-fold increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
In the parent grant for this application (1R01CA276666), we described a novel CRISPR-mediated chromosome
engineering methodology that allows us to eliminate specific aneuploid chromosomes from human cancer cells.
We proposed to apply this approach to interrogate the consequences of chromosome 1q aneuploidies in a
genetically-controlled setting. In this supplemental application, we plan to leverage these same chromosome
engineering techniques to study gains of chromosome 21 in leukemia. In particular, we will eliminate single
copies of chromosome 21 from human AML cell lines that are aneuploid for this chromosome, thereby creating
genetically-matched cells that are either disomic or trisomic for chromosome 21. We will then examine how loss
of the chromosome 21 trisomy impacts various cancer-related phenotypes, including gene expression, cell
fitness, and drug sensitivity. Additionally, we will over-express individual chromosome 21 genes in our
engineered chromosome 21-loss cell lines, which will allow us to identify specific genes encoded on this
chromosome that impact specific leukemic phenotypes. These assays will address the NCI’s INCLUDE program
goal of uncovering genetic factors associated with trisomy 21 that lead to the distinct biological and clinical
behavior of Down syndrome-associated leukemias."

Given the inability of the immune response to consistently suppress HIV without antiretroviral therapy and the
insufficient potency of current cure approaches, genetic engineering modalities may offer a potent alternative to
intrinsic immunity. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have shown impressive efficacy in eliminating blood
cell cancers in the clinic, and CAR T cells re-engineered to target HIV using the CD4 ectodomain represent a
potent escape-resistant cellular therapy demonstrated to have enhanced cytolytic function. Our prior work has
demonstrated that when engineered to express both the 4-1BB and CD28 costimulatory domains and protected
from HIV infection, HIV-specific CD4 ectodomain CAR T cells can reduce acute viremia, prevent CD4+ T cell
loss, and reduce viral burden in the tissues of HIV-infected humanized mice. However, the of reduction plasma
viral loads was ultimately transient, suggesting that the potency of HIV-specific CAR T cells should be further
optimized for clinical translation. We propose that low expression of HIV Envelope (Env) on HIV-infected cells
yields targets with low antigen density. Our preliminary data demonstrates that the potency of CD4 ectodomain
CARs is severely attenuated in instances of low antigen density. We reason that this necessitates the design of
HIV-specific CAR T cells with enhanced antigen sensitivity. As the characteristics dictating antigen sensitivity
are not yet fully described for CAR T cells, we generated a diverse panel of broadly neutralizing antibody-based
CAR T cells, specifically to (1) determine the relationship between epitope accessibility, CAR avidity, and antigen
sensitivity on HIV-specific CAR T cell potency and (2) identify orthogonal CAR-driven escape patterns informing
optimal multi-specificity CAR products that restrict HIV escape in vivo. The ultimate goal is to generate an
enhanced HIV-specific CAR T cell product with the ability to kill HIV-infected cells expressing low levels of antigen
in order to improve the translational potential of a CAR T cell approach for a functional HIV cure."
11020809,"Project Summary
 In nature, metalloenzymes make up approximately one third of the known enzymes and play central roles
in biological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and nitrogen fixation. Heme-containing
metalloenzymes are particularly important in the context of energy conversion reactions due in part to their ability
to cycle between redox states. Furthermore, heme-containing enzymes can oxidize a broad range of substrates
in both a stereospecific and regiospecific manner, attracting interest for use in challenging chemical reactions
requiring C-H activation, C-C bond cleavage, or heteroatom oxidation. These enzymes are thus prime candidates
for biotechnological and synthetic applications, including production of pharmaceutical drugs, chemical
conversion of fatty acids and steroids, detoxification of drugs and toxins, and the synthesis of the industrially
relevant chemicals, fragrances, and flavors.
 While heme proteins have been studied extensively, increasing amounts of genomic data have led to the
prediction of many additional heme, diheme, and multiheme protein families, of which the functional roles and
biochemical properties remain unexplored. Once such protein is MbnH, originally identified in methanotrophic
bacteria. MbnH is a member of the PF03150 bacterial cytochrome c peroxidase (bCcP)/MauG superfamily and
utilizes a rare bis-FeIV cofactor for the oxidation of a specific tryptophan residue within a partner protein, MbnP.
While other high-valent Fe states, such as compound I and compound ES, are relatively well understood, given
the limited biological examples of diheme bis-FeIV states, there is a fundamental gap in our understanding of
how nature stabilizes and uses bis-FeIV states without causing cellular damage. Nearly all previous research has
focused on MauG, limiting the generalizability of the role of the bis-FeIV species and the chemical capacity of
such an oxidant. Thus, the proposed research will leverage the huge amount of genomic information available
to expand the scope of studies on the bCcP/MauG superfamily. This includes representative members of the
annotated but uncharacterized protein families, SPOA0271 and TIGR3891, as well as new cluster identified by
the Enzyme Function Initiative Genome-Neighborhood Tool (EFI-GNT) tool as clusters 4 and 11. The broad
objective of this application is to establish how divergent bacterial diheme proteins stabilize high-valent bis-FeIV
states and then use that intermediates to accomplish site-specific substrate oxidation. It will address outstanding
questions related to the formation and stabilization of bis-FeIV, the catalytic capability of the bis-FeIV species, and
the biological role of this cofactor."

Childhood trauma, particularly interpersonal violence (IPV) exposure, is widespread and associated with long-
term negative health outcomes, including increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and mood disorders. Physiological responses to stress, if chronic or severe enough
and especially those occurring during vulnerable life periods such as adolescence, can promote lasting
systemic changes and may contribute to health inequities seen in vulnerable populations. Exposure to trauma
prior to age 14 has differential effects compared to exposure later in adolescence, but little is known about the
biological mechanisms that underlie differential effects of trauma timing. A key biological marker that holds
potential in human subject studies is the extracellular vesicle (EV). Changes in EV size and protein content are
responsive to stress, can be easily assayed, and are predictive of functionality and tissue specificity important
for health and disease. We recently identified a unique protein signature in blood plasma from an unbiased EV
proteomic analysis in Black women who had experienced IPV during adolescence (14-18 years of age). This
diversity supplement will examine dynamic changes in EV characteristics associated with fear conditioning and
relate those changes to the developmental timing of IPV exposure (i.e. childhood vs. adolescence) utilizing a
longitudinal birth cohort of Black Americans who grew up in an under-resourced urban environment. We will
determine whether dynamic changes in EV characteristics quantified before and after fear conditioning differ
based on developmental timing of interpersonal violence by comparing participants who experienced IPV
before age 14, between ages 14-18, or did not experience IPV trauma. We will also examine whether
individual differences in EV characteristics quantified before and after fear conditioning correlate with individual
differences in fear-potentiated startle. This project will contribute to understanding EV’s potential as biomarkers
for systemic impacts of interpersonal violence experienced during vulnerable time periods and provide vital
information to elucidate potential novel targets for identification of and early intervention for individuals at risk of
stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders."
11016900,"Human diseases arise from complex interactions between genetics and the environment, and as our environment changes, genetic variations that were once beneficial can now contribute to diseases. The Western high-sugar diet has led to a global surge in metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity, but our comprehension of the genetic-diet interactions in these conditions remains limited. Studying these interactions at the organismal level is challenging due to the absence of intermediate molecular phenotypes like transcriptome and metabolome data. To address this, our project aims to identify genetic variations linked to high-sugar diet-induced disease phenotypes in Drosophila, culminating in the construction of a comprehensive gene-transcript-metabolitephenotype 
network. Leveraging both outbred and inbred Drosophila populations and integrating molecular phenotypes, we seek to understand how these variations influence susceptibility to complex disease traits. Our preliminary data indicates that a high-sugar diet disrupts metabolic balance, revealing cryptic genetic variations that are hard to detect under normal conditions. To achieve our objectives, we first embark on exploring the phenome by inducing disease phenotypes in Drosophila populations through a high-sugar diet. This endeavor allows us to evaluate phenotypic variation and heritability, and identify correlations among metabolic, developmental, and mitochondrial traits. Next, we delve into unraveling the genome, employing a fine mapping strategy to uncover cryptic genetic variations under high-sugar dietary stress and gene-diet interactions across different sugar concentrations. Lastly, we center on deciphering the metabolome and transcriptome, employing 
a systems biology approach that integrates genetic variations with metabolomic and transcriptomic data. This integration will uncover the relationships between gene expression, metabolite profiles, and complex organismal traits in the context of diet-induced metabolic disorders. Overall, we expect to reveal novel gene-diet interactions and previously elusive pathway components, offering the potential to introduce new multi-omic strategies for investigating metabolic diseases. The successful execution of this research promises to propel precision medicine, enhance metabolic well-being, and deepen our core knowledge concerning the genetics underlying complex metabolic disorders."
11046491,"Our proposed project focuses on understanding the concepts of reserve and resilience, switching from a static 
perspective often applied in the literature to dynamic adaptation to the environment. Our validated dynamic 
Neurocognitive Adaptation (dNA) Scale will explore how individuals are engaged in protective cognitive and 
leisure activities, throughout their lifetime, and the relationship between these behaviors and gold-standard 
neuropsychological-neurophysiological markers of cognitive health, to understand presentation and 
mechanisms of individual adaptation to the environment through life. Neuropsychological measures of working 
memory and executive functions will be used to assess cognitive flexibility, while graph theoretical metrics of 
functional connectivity (FC) will be used to assess neurophysiological efficiency. Together, these components 
will give us a measure of neurocognitive adaptation, which is likely to clarify mechanisms of AD resilience. We 
will further investigate the role of AD risk factors and early pathology (amyloid, inflammation) in moderating 
effects of adaptive behavior on outcomes. Furthermore, as women show different structural and functional 
reserve characteristics, we will include sex as a factor when examining individual dynamic adaptation to the 
environment. The objective of this proposal is to investigate multiple domains (cognitive, physical, creative, and 
social) in 7-time windows from childhood (0-10 years old) to old age (+ 65 years old), exploring individual 
adaptation to the environment and its potential protective factors against neurodegeneration. Testing 
convergent validity of the dNA against gold-standard neuropsychological tests and fMRI measures of executive 
function in aging is an important innovation, and lays a foundation for implementing the dNA in at-risk and AD 
populations. The rationale for this project is that the concept of reserve is mostly static, based on unmodifiable 
variables (IQ and formal education), and poorly suited for understanding the role of time in this protective role. 
From our perspective, environment and learning change through the lifetime dynamically, as does individual 
subjective adaptation to environment. Specific Aim 1 will determine association of adaptation profiles with 
education and gold standard measures of cognitive flexibility, such as working memory, problem solving, setshifting, 
and inhibition in cognitively Healthy Controls (HCs). Our hypothesis is that greater maintenance in 
activities through lifetime will relate to higher education and better cognitive flexibility and peripheral 
inflammation will moderate this effect. Specific Aim 2 will establish association of adaptation profiles and gold 
standard measures of neurophysiological efficiency through fMRI (FC) and graph theoretical metrics during 
resting state. Our hypothesis is that greater maintenance in activities through lifetime will relate to better 
segregation of the Default Network (DN) and parahippocampal–hippocampal network, and integration with 
other regions, with stronger anticorrelation between DN activation – Dorsal Attention Network (DAN) 
deactivation during resting state. Peripheral inflammation will moderate this effect. Specific Aim 3 will explore 
the specific role of the dNA as a moderator between sex and the “neurocognitive efficiency” in HCs and Mild 
Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Our hypothesis is that in HC and MCI patients the association between risk 
factors (predictors) and neuroefficiency (outcomes) will be moderated by the dNA profile. To achieve these 
aims, we will recruit participants from Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health."
11008078,"Project Summary
Despite the growing number of adults that are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) worldwide,
there still lacks disease modifying treatments. Physical activity and exercise mitigate AD risk and
boosts cognitive functions in patients, yet over a quarter of the elderly do not meet these activity
guidelines, often due to physical limitations and resource constraints. Current therapeutic
approaches focused on AD are restricted to targeting neuropathology within the central nervous
system. Thus, there is an imperative need to develop alternative therapies that confer benefits of
exercise to AD patients, circumventing their physical limitations. Prior work by our research team
identified Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-Specific Phospholipase D1 (Gpld1) an exercise-induced
circulating factor in blood plasma that mediates the neurogenic and cognitive benefits of exercise
in aged mice and shows neurobehavioral relevance in elderly human adults. Systemically
increasing Gpld1 levels in blood mimicked the beneficial effects of exercise on cognitive function
and AD-related neuropathology in aged mice and mouse models of AD pathology. The purpose
of this study is to translate the scientific discoveries identifying peripheral targets in blood –
GPLD1 in particular – as novel potential therapeutic blood-based exercise mimetics to treat AD-
related dementias. We will achieve this with Three Specific Aims: 1: Identify three lead
recombinant human GPLD1 molecules. 2: Establish optimal exposure through extensive in vivo
PK profiling in aged wild type mice of the three lead recombinant human GPLD1 molecules. 3:
Test one primary and one alternate lead recombinant human GPLD1 molecule for disease
modification in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD pathology. Successful completion of these aims is
the critical first step for the identification and commercialization of potential therapeutic blood-
based exercise mimetics to treat AD-related dementias."
11008453,"Development of Novel Therapeutics for Asthma
BioTherapeutics Inc (BTI) is an emerging biotech company that synergistically combines the power of
advanced computational modeling with translational experimentation to accelerate the development of novel
precision medicine therapeutics for asthma, allergy and autoimmune diseases. An unmet clinical need for safer,
more effective drugs for asthma remains as current therapies have limited efficacy and adverse side effects.
Asthma is a chronic, widespread allergic disease with total expenses exceeding $80 billion annually in the U.S.
Current therapies for asthma are modestly effective with significant side effects. Specifically, type 2 asthma
patients can develop steroid dependency in neutrophilic asthma, while non-type 2 asthma has a lower
responsiveness to current treatments. Recent attempts to target this population have been unsuccessful, with
anti-TNF, anti-IL-17 receptor and chemokine inhibitors failing in clinical trials, while macrolides and methotrexate
have shown mild improvement but at high side effect risk. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for safer and
more efficacious asthma therapeutics. In the last years, regulatory T (Treg) cells have gained increased
recognition in the treatment of inflammatory and allergic diseases. Furthermore, metabolic dysregulation has
also been associated with the pathogenesis of this complex disorder. Immunometabolic manipulation of Treg
cells to restore their suppressive capacity has been postulated as a promising novel therapeutic approach for
asthma. Indeed, in asthma patients, Treg cells present deficient suppressive ability. Administration of Tregs in
animal models of allergic asthma can resolve the established chronic inflammation. Moreover, targeting of
glucose and oxidative metabolism have also resulted in decreased inflammation and airway
hyperresponsiveness. This SBIR Phase I application will develop a novel immunoregulatory and
immunometabolic therapeutic for the treatment of asthma. The Specific Aims are to:
Aim 1. Determine the safety profile and pharmacokinetics (PK) of the new immunoregulatory therapeutic
by evaluating oral bioavailability and distribution and conducting general toxicity studies in rats.
Aim 2. Characterize the therapeutic efficacy and route of administration of the new immunoregulatory
therapeutic using ovalbumin and house dust mite induced models of neutrophilic asthma. Efficacy studies will
be determined by airway resistance, lung histopathology, flow cytometry and cytokine expression.
Expected successful outcomes are: i) ≥ 50 % decrease in lung histological lesions and ≥40% decreased
infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lungs; ii) ≥ 50% suppression of airway resistance; iii) ≥ 50%
decreased infiltration of neutrophils in the lungs of treated mice; and iv) lung concentrations ≥ 25 ng/g and
NOAEL ≥ 1,000 mg/kg in rats.
Commercial Application: The impact of this new, oral, immunoregulatory asthma drug has the potential to
address the unmet needs of 27 million U.S. patients and disrupt an global market of $20 billion/yr by 2026."
11008472,"Abstract
Rejuvenation Technologies Inc. (RTI) seeks to improve the tools required for clinical translation of intravenously-
infused RNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) therapeutics. While there is abundant work on RNA LNP vaccines, the
requirements for intravenously-infused LNPs are significantly more demanding, because instead of causing an
immune response as with a vaccine, IV-infused LNPs must avoid an immune response. Immune responses can
be caused by the RNA or the LNP components, and can lead to adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, anaphylactic
shock, desensitization or sensitization, and reduced drug potency with repeat dosing. As a test case, RTI will
focus on their telomere extension biologic, which has shown highly successful proof-of-concept rescue of
multiple mouse models of liver and lung disease. Telomeres are the protective DNA tips of chromosomes.
Telomeres shorten with each cell division, eventually exposing the DNA tip, causing genome instability and
progenitor cell apoptosis or senescence. This diminishes the regenerative capacity of organs, driving a number
of pathological conditions that include aging-related diseases like lung, kidney, and liver fibrosis, and bone
marrow failure. Thus, telomere extension represents a promising strategy for regenerative medicine. RTI’s
solution is to extend critically short telomeres by transiently increasing TERT levels via targeted delivery of
modified TERT mRNA in biodegradable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). RTI has multiple LNPs capable of delivering
mRNA to the lung or liver with world- leading efficiency, transfecting >90% of target cells, even in diseased
organs. Upon delivery to cells, TERT mRNA is translated to functional TERT protein, and both are degraded
within days, yet telomeres are extended sufficiently to reverse years of shortening. Preliminary work has shown
the strong potential benefits of the TERT therapy in models of both liver and lung fibrosis. Moreover, RTI has
developed broadly transfecting-LNPs capable of transfecting 16 tissues in non-human primates, opening the
door to extra-hepatic extra-pulmonary mRNA delivery. In the future, RTI intends to add targeting ligands,
conferring additional cell type-specificity and enabling the extension of these results to other forms of disease.
In this Direct to Phase II project, RTI seeks to develop a platform that can be used for efficient translation and
manufacturing following FDA’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls guidelines of TERT mRNA LNP therapies
from preclinical models to the clinic. To do so, RTI will undertake four specific aims: 1) high-sensitivity drug-
specific analytical capability development, 2) high-sensitivity cell-type-specific biodistribution, 3) evaluating drug
component stability, and 4) high-sensitivity bioanalytical methods for identifying drug breakdown products. These
studies will provide the high-sensitivity methods critical for clinical translation of intravenously-infused RNA LNP
therapeutic drug products. As a specific use case, these studies will support translation of RTI’s TERT mRNA
LNPs for multiple clinical indications with dire unmet medical need."
11009318,"SUMMARY
The risk of tuberculosis (TB) is twice as high during and immediately after pregnancy than any other time in a
person’s life, and pregnant people with TB who are co-infected with HIV are at higher risk for mortality. More
than 200,000 pregnant people develop TB annually, with the majority living in Africa, where HIV prevalence is
high, and Asia. Pregnancy carries a high risk of adverse outcomes including miscarriage, preterm birth and
increased risk of maternal to child HIV transmission. Thus, optimizing care for pregnant and breastfeeding people
(PBP) should be a global priority. However, PBP are routinely excluded from TB clinical trials and denied equal
access to novel TB treatment options. In 2013, a panel of experts published a consensus statement for
accelerated inclusion of PBP in TB clinical trials. A new shorter TB treatment regimen is now recommended as
an option for adults and adolescents globally; but not PBP. Potential access to this regimen will remain limited
in PBP without the required data regarding dosing and safety for PBP and the developing fetus. There is a
perception that the standard regimen is sufficient and safe, and that PBP would not want to take a new regimen.
However, no one has asked PBP, TB program managers or healthcare providers (HCP) in TB-endemic countries
what guides their decisions to take or recommend treatment regimens in PBP.
The Radiant-Moms study will use discrete choice experiment (DCE) to examine preferences among PBP and
HCP regarding novel shorter TB treatment regimens during the pregnancy and postpartum periods. We will
conduct the study in South Africa and the Philippines, representing different geographical settings with high TB
burden and varying HIV prevalence. We will employ a two-phase mixed-methods design. In Phase I we will use
qualitative methods to elicit input from stakeholders from the target populations: PBP, HCP, key informants, and
community influencers from each country to determine optimal DCE survey design. We will also conduct in-depth
qualitative cohort interviews in PBP with recent TB over time to gain an in-depth understanding of experiences
during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In Phase II, quantitative activities will consist of a structured survey
among PBP and HCP, including preferences for attributes of TB treatment regimens and service delivery models
(DCE). We will also identify barriers and facilitators to inclusion of PBP in TB trials among key stakeholders.
Radiant-Moms will generate key evidence to support the evaluation, adoption, and safe practical implementation
of new shorter TB treatment regimens during pregnancy and postpartum programmatically and provide global
impetus and guidelines for their broader use with substantial benefits that shorter effective treatment may confer
to PBP and their infants. Data from this study will help inform prioritization and implementation of future trials
including safety and pharmacokinetic studies of new TB regimens in pregnancy and the postpartum period.
Radiant-Moms will provide a model for the earlier and appropriate inclusion of PBP in clinical trials of novel TB
treatments, for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB and prevention in the future."
11009319,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent behind acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) and the resulting pandemic. Antiretroviral therapies are effective in controlling infections, however
patients require lifelong treatment and can have severe side effects, resulting in the constant need for novel
therapeutics. Therefore, a better understanding of the interaction between host cells and HIV-1 can unmask
novel targets for therapeutics. Recent reports identified that MARCH1, 2 and 8, members of a family of host E3
ubiquitin ligases known as Membrane Associated RING-CH (MARCH) proteins, whose physiological functions
involve immune receptor homeostasis, restrict HIV-1 by blocking the incorporation of viral envelope glycoproteins
in nascent virions. Another member of the MARCH protein family, MARCH9, reduces HIV-1 infectivity, however,
its mechanism of restriction is unknown and different from that of MARCH1, 2 and 8. MARCH9 targets immune
cell receptors for ubiquitin and subsequential lysosomal degradation as a means of maintaining homeostasis
including MHC-1 and ICAM-1. Preliminary data shown in this proposal demonstrate that MARCH9 reduces the
cellular levels of all HIV-1 structural proteins thereby resulting in reduced viral particle production, which is quite
different from what has been shown with MARCH1, 2 and 8. Additional data show that MARCH9 does not affect
cell viability. The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which MARCH9 restricts HIV-1 infection.
The experiments outlined here will characterize the step in the HIV-1 life cycle that MARCH9 acts on to inhibit
HIV-1 particle production and the mechanism it utilizes to do so. Additionally, we will determine the role of
endogenous MARCH9 through shRNA knockdown on CD4+ T cells and Monocyte derived Macrophages
(MDMs) to better elucidate its antiviral mechanism. The proposed work will determine the role of MARCH9 in
HIV-1 infection. In doing so, this proposal will provide new insights into the role of the MARCH protein family
during retrovirus infection. Finally, the findings of this proposal have the potential to provide new therapeutic
targets for the development of novel antiretrovirals."
11009351,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In many settings worldwide, harmful substance use coincides with other epidemics of communicable and non-
communicable disease. Merrill Singer first theorized in 1996 the concept of a “syndemic”, which manifests
when epidemics co-occur, are driven by harmful social conditions, and synergistically interact to amplify the
burden of disease. The theory of syndemics has gained significant traction in the field, but existing empirical
work has been criticized on both conceptual and empirical grounds. Until this gap in the literature is filled,
efforts to develop clinical and structural interventions to reduce harmful substance use will remain limited. The
objective of this K24 application is to characterize the syndemic of polysubstance use, HIV, and other
communicable and non-communicable diseases among participants in the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort
Study, while enhancing the applicant's mentorship skills and expanding his capacity to provide mentorship to
more Early-Stage Investigators seeking to conduct patient-oriented research on substance use-associated
syndemics. The rationale for submitting this K24 application at this time is that the applicant's funding follows
an academic physician-scientist “soft money” model, and new leadership roles have increased the number of
prospective trainees seeking his research mentorship. Three specific aims will be achieved: Aim 1—Mentoring:
The applicant will create a novel research mentoring program and expand his mentoring portfolio by providing
mentorship in the conduct of patient-oriented research on substance use-associated syndemics to 3–5
additional Early-Stage Investigators, per year. Aim 2—Career Development: The applicant will undertake new
training in the estimation of psychological symptom networks and simulation modeling, while building his skills
as a mentor by completing courses informed by validated curricula in mentoring science. Aim 3—Research:
Novel methods developed for the estimation of psychological symptom networks will be used to characterize
the syndemic of polysubstance use, HIV, and other communicable and non-communicable diseases among
participants in the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study. Simulation modeling will be used to identify the most
effective hypothetical clinical and structural intervention strategies for addressing the syndemic. The key
significance and innovation of this proposal is its novel application of methods to characterize substance use-
associated syndemics and to identify concrete strategies for intervention. If this K24 is awarded, the expected
contribution is that the applicant will be able to fulfill a greater proportion of current requests for mentorship;
make fundamental contributions to resolve longstanding challenges in understanding substance use-
associated syndemics, leading to novel strategies for clinical and structural intervention; and use the K24-
supported research studies as training vehicles for junior investigators interested in substance use research."
11016187,"Project Summary
Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a type of acute lung injury and one of the leading causes of mortality in Sickle
Cell Disease (SCD). The etiological mechanism that triggers ACS remains poorly understood. 10-20% of SCD
patients hospitalized with acute systemic painful vaso-occlusive episodes develop ACS within next few days,
suggesting that molecular events surrounding vaso-occlusion contribute to lung injury. This epidemiology also
offers a therapeutic window to halt the development of ACS, provided that targeted therapies are identified. In
the first cycle of R01, we used real time in vivo multi-photon-excitation microscopy to make a novel finding that
ACS in SCD mice is secondary to micro-embolism of precapillary pulmonary arterioles by neutrophil-platelet
aggregates. These findings have been published in AJRCCM 2019, JCI-Insight 2017 & 2020, Blood Advances
2017 & 2020, Experimental Hematology 2020, Blood 2020 and Haematologica 2015. We found that platelet P-
selectin contributed to formation of these micro-embolic cellular aggregates and P-selectin inhibition reduced
lung vaso-occlusion by ~50%. Supporting the relevance of our mouse model, recent clinical trial reported ~50%
reduction in pain episodes in SCD patients given P-selectin Ab therapy. In the present renewal of our 5-year
R01, we identify additional P-selectin-independent pathological inflammatory signaling events that can be
targeted to further inhibit lung vaso-occlusion and ACS in SCD. Based on our new preliminary findings, we
hypothesize that liver-derived circulating-fragments of neutrophil extracellular traps (cNETs) arrive in the lung to
promote neutrophil-platelet aggregate-enabled pulmonary arteriole micro-embolism in SCD. We also propose
that inhibiting pore forming protein gasdermin-D (GSDMD)-dependent signaling in neutrophils prevents cNETs
generation and development of ACS. We will test this hypothesis using our newly developed model of
intravenous hemoglobin induced ACS in SCD mice, in vivo imaging of lung in live mice, in vitro microfluidic
studies with patient blood, and SCD mice genetically deficient in GSDMD or platelet-P-selectin. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether SCD mice genetically deficient in platelet-P-selectin are only partially protected from
pulmonary arteriole micro-embolism and ACS. In Aim 2, we will determine whether cNETs shed in the liver, travel
to the lung to promote P-selectin-independent pulmonary arteriole micro-embolism in SCD. In Aim 3, we will
determine whether caspase-4/11-dependent activation of neutrophil-GSDMD promotes shedding of cNETs and
development of ACS in SCD. These studies will introduce a novel paradigm that translocation of DAMPs from
liver to lung promotes lung injury in SCD, and also identify a new GSDMD-mediated, P-selectin-independent
mechanism of ACS in SCD."
11023610,"Project Summary (Parent Grant R35GM152165)
In both mitosis and meiosis, success depends on accurately pulling partner chromosomes away from one
another on a spindle composed of microtubules. The microtubules attach to the chromosomes at their
kinetochores. When the partners errantly move to the same pole a chromosome imbalance is created,
producing cells with too many or too few chromosomes (aneuploidy). Meiotic errors produce aneuploid
gametes, the major cause of birth defects and infertility, while aneuploidy in somatic cells is associated with
tumor progression. The goal of this project is to elucidate mechanisms that allow chromosomes to correctly
attach to microtubules so they segregate appropriately in meiosis and mitosis. Three concurrent projects will
address this goal. Experiments in Project 1 will elucidate the mechanisms used to partition chromosomes in
meiosis I. When cells enter meiosis, homologous chromosomes are not connected to each other, but they
become linked by crossovers (chiasma). These linkages help homologous chromosomes to move away from
each other in meiosis I. The linkages transmit tension between the homologous centromeres when they
become attached correctly to microtubules from opposite sides of the spindle. Tension stabilizes these
attachments. A second kind of connection called centromere pairing allows the centromeres of model
chromosomes to become linked. Project 1 will explore the basis by which centromeres become connected by
centromere pairing and determine how often natural chromosomes rely on centromere pairing to ensure they
segregate correctly at meiosis I. Project 2 will define the biophysical properties of connections made by
centromere pairing and chiasmata in transmitting tension between centromeres. Project 2 will also investigate
whether chiasmata in different chromosomal positions have different biophysical properties that explain their
different abilities to ensure proper segregation. A final project focuses more on mitosis. Cells with abnormally
high chromosome numbers, for example many tumor cell lines and polyploid cells, rely on high level
expression of the cell cycle kinase Mps1 for their survival. The same is true for meiotic cells. Mps1 plays many
roles, but this Mps1-addiction of certain vulnerable cell types appears linked to a role for Mps1 in attaching
chromosomes correctly to microtubules in mitosis and meiosis. The experiments in Project 3 will test the
hypothesis that Mps1 mediates a form of chromosome movement called chromosome gliding that might help
chromosomes move to favorable positions on prometaphase spindles. Finally, genetic screens in Mps1-
addicted mammalian and yeast cells will be used to identify the vulnerable Mps1 pathways. These projects will
be collaborative and synergistic and reveal unique insights into centromere behavior in meiosis and
chromosome microtubule interactions in mitosis. They will include emerging technologies in budding yeast and
collaborative efforts that exploit other model systems to advance our knowledge of chromosome biology."
11022547,"This project will define the molecular spectrum of white matter vascular lesions that drive vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a spectrum that begins in the vessel but progresses to include brain-wide changes in inflammation, dysregulated cell-cell communication, and cortical disconnection, ultimately leading to VCID. The goal of this research proposal is to develop a VCID Center With Out Walls (CWOW) that will advance a mechanistic understanding of the molecular pathways driving VCID while testing the efficacy of multiple VCID therapeutics. Converging evidence indicates that white matter vascular lesions resulting from CSVD modulate the location, severity, and progression of neuroinflammation, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration in AD-ADRD conditions. However, a key knowledge gap is the precise identification of molecular pathways both within cerebral small vessels and in brain networks at-large that mediate the cognitive impairment and dementia associated with white matter vascular lesions. Recent work and preliminary data from our group points to distinct molecular pathways driving inflammatory signaling and disrupted cellular communication in white matter endothelial cells, that produce disordered signaling in the microenvironment of cells around white matter vessels (the neurovascular niche), which leads to white matter axonal damage and then cortical disconnection acting through molecular pathways linking CSVD and AD. This vessel inflammation-to-cognitive impairment progression will be characterized using sophisticated viral, genetic, BRAIN initiative imaging technology, and human-to-rodent data alignment. Further, we will test three candidate therapeutics, developed by the PI’s, that interdict this vessel inflammation to brain disconnection progression. We will test this hypothesis using an unparalleled combination of prodromal, isolated, recurrent, and mixed ADRD rodent models of CSVD. We will use mechanistic studies aimed at identifying and validating molecular systems regulating white matter inflammation (SA1) as well as cortical dysfunction (SA2), and by developing a unique human single-cell sequencing dataset and applying translational VCID imaging biomarkers to rodent models of VCID to exploit regional differences in brain resilience (SA3). End point metrics will include: i) inflammatory vessel signaling cascades shared across prodromal CSVD models (aging, obesity, hypertension, and AD backgrounds); ii) inter-regional and inter-hemispheric measures of cortical disconnection that vary across lesion type and neurodegenerative comorbidity, iii) cellular, molecular, and imaging correlates of regional brain resilience to white matter vascular lesions, and iv) therapeutic efficacy of three novel VCID therapeutics targeting these pathways. This project and its research team leverages recognized leaders in VCID with relevant technical expertise to advance a VCID CWOW framework that will accelerate the identification of new therapeutic targets and diagnostic strategies to VCID."

11013734,"Summary/Abstract: Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) adversely
impact our large and growing aging population. An estimated 5.8 million American’s 65 years and older are
suffering from AD, with that number projected to hit 13.8 million by 2050. Aging African American and Latinx
populations are particularly hard-hit by AD/ADRD, as are rural communities due to lack of access to clinical
trials and medical care. A broad range of symptoms are associated with these diseases and each patient’s
progression is unique and clinically quite variable. During a clinical trial, when longitudinal studies are
conducted over months to years, much of the patient’s lifestyle and function goes unmonitored as they are at
home with their partner or alone and without contact with professional providers. Infrequent data collection
relies on the ability of patients to accurately retrieve relevant details about their lives since the last checkup,
which is inherently inaccurate or incomplete due to the challenges of self-report and recall. Thus, there is a
critical need in clinical trials for more frequent, accurate, and complete patient monitoring especially in
communities that are currently underserved. To meet this need, Life Analytics is furthering the development of an
at-home monitoring platform, called Life Analytics Monitoring Platform (LAMP). LAMP is based off of the NIH
and VA funded Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative system. CART is an end-to-
end (hardware and software) platform, which provides high-frequency monitoring of geriatric disease progression
by measuring real-world data, thus providing a digital remote assessment model to the academic research
community. The CART system was built by, and has been further developed by, our research team in the Oregon
Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH). Through these efforts a highly functional generalizable
infrastructure for support and deployment of these systems for academic research has been established. To
date, the ORCATECH/CART platform has been installed in more than 1000 homes across North America and
is currently collecting and transmitting data back to ORCATECH servers for analysis. Additionally, the LA
team has shown through publication that high-frequency in-home monitoring data allows clinical studies to be
appropriately powered with fewer patients. Therefore, this platform has the high potential to change the way that
clinical trials are conducted – if such a system can broadly disseminated. This Fastrack will assist with the critical
research and development required to improve the existing ORCATECH/CART platform into the
commercialized LAMP platform through the following Aims: SA 1 (Phase I): Migrate ORCATECH/CART
system to secure and scalable cloud operability. SA 2 (Phase II): Optimization of LAMP for data transfer, storage,
and analysis. SA 3 (Phase II): Demonstrate LAMP usability with Alpha-testing with a third party, off-site location.

Western blot assays are fundamental tools used in biological and biomedical laboratories around the world. They
have played a role in some of the most important discoveries of the last century with regards to diseases such
as AIDS, Alzheimer’s, cancer, and drug-resistant infection to name just a few. As we “dig deeper” into the
complex biomolecular networks that define living organisms, however, our requirements for our tools become
increasingly demanding. For example, we now want to examine not simply the presence or absence of a
particular protein in a sample, but would like to know the absolute concentration of that particular protein, the
concentration of any post-translationally modified variants of that particular protein, and the concentration of that
particular protein relative to other particular proteins. Many relevant proteins, and particularly their post-
translationally modified variants are present at concentrations that are quite low. Western blot assays, and, in
particular, fluorescent Western blot assays are an ideal tool for performing the measurements needed to “dig
deeper” because they are capable of detecting and quantifying multiple specific proteins simultaneously, even if
the proteins are of a similar size, such as is the case with post-translationally modified variants. Unfortunately,
fluorescent Western blots suffer from feeble signal due to currently available fluorescent probes, restricting the
absolute amount of protein which can be interrogated using fluorescent Western blots. Our product, which we
call a Plasmonic Fluor (PF) and which is the subject of the present grant application, is an ultrabright
fluorescent reagent designed to improve the detection sensitivity of fluorescent Western blots by orders
of magnitude without requiring any changes to assay workflow or hardware.
Since a major limitation of current fluorescence Westerns is the cost of the reader, we have also created a
prototype reader which is incredibly inexpensive relative to current readers, but which can actually outperform
them when combined with our PF technology. We will create plug-and-play PF reagents that are spectrally
equivalent to the current state of the art LI-COR’s 680LT and 800CW. We will demonstrate that we can offer
significantly enhanced performance at lower cost than existing techniques for this important methodology."
11008239,"Aging and HIV are characterized by systemic chronic inflammation (inflammaging) and chronic immune
activation (IA), both associated with cell senescence, functional impairment of immune cells and reduced
immunity to infections and vaccines. Aging and HIV are also associated with metabolic changes such as
decreased insulin sensitivity, dysregulated nutrient uptake and dysfunctional mitochondria. As a consequence
of these changes, metabolites involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism are released in blood. Some of
these metabolites have been shown to be positively associated with inflammaging and therefore expected to be
also associated with dysfunctional immunity. In people living with HIV (PWH) metabolic abnormalities have been
related to virus-induced irreversible tissue damage in viremic individuals, as well as to anti-retroviral therapy
(ART)-induced effects in virally suppressed individuals.
 Immune cells need to undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet the demands associated with immune
responses, and rely on anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to do so. The effects of aging in PWH
on these pathways and on the metabolic mechanisms involved in the regulation of immune cell function are
largely unknown and are the primary objectives of this proposal. Our hypothesis, supported by strong preliminary
results, is that aging exacerbates immune defects through a dysregulated metabolic reprogramming and this
effect is even more pronounced in PWH. Our studies have demonstrated that a higher metabolic status of
immune cells is associated with higher intrinsic IA and lower capacity to generate protective immunity.
 This proposal will use data and samples from the MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) of PWH
and age- gender- and sociodemographically matched people without HIV (PWoH). We plan to evaluate how
aging influences the serum metabolic profile of PWH and how this impacts the function, phenotype and
transcriptional profiles of B cells, T cells and monocytes, the major cell types participating in immune responses
to infections and vaccines. The role played by gut microbial metabolism on metabolic status will also be evaluated
(Aim 1); we will investigate the metabolic mechanisms as well as metabolic requirements of the immune cells
(Aim 2); and we will perform experiments using senolytics and metabolic modifiers to block senescent and
metabolic pathways and improve, at least in vitro, immune cell function (Aim 3). Because obesity is a condition
associated with altered metabolism, experiments will use samples from lean and obese PWH of different ages,
as evaluated by body composition measures such as weight, waist/hip/thigh circumference, and bioelectrical
impedance analysis to assess body fat amounts and depots. Younger (<50 years) and older (>60 years) lean
and obese PWoH will also be included as controls. Results obtained will allow the identification of senescent and
metabolic pathways to be targeted to improve the immune function of PWH up to the levels observed in PWoH
controls."

In the United States alone, an estimated 1.45 million people suffer from Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), a chronic
autoimmune disease resulting from immune-mediated destruction of insulin- producing pancreatic b cells.
Autoimmune recognition of b cells leads to significant loss of b cell mass, resulting in impaired control of blood
glucose levels and hyperglycemia. Standard care involves continuous blood glucose monitoring and daily insulin
replacement. However, the life expectancy of T1D patients is reduced by ~ 20 years compared to the general
population, highlighting an urgent need to develop novel therapies that prevent b cell destruction.
A long pre-clinical period marked by the appearance of immunological abnormalities, including functional loss of
intestinal homeostasis, precedes disease onset in T1D mouse models and patients. A failure to develop
immunological tolerance is centered around a reduced number and function of tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs)
in the small intestinal mucosa, which are critical to the maintenance of GI homeostasis by promoting regulatory
T cell (Treg) induction. Although aberrant APC activity is critical for T1D pathogenesis, there have been no DC-
targeted therapies developed to date for the treatment of T1D. Qrono Inc is developing QR402, a first-in-class,
oral, DC-specific AMPK pathway agonist as a preventative therapy for T1D. QR402 uses custom nanoparticles
to directly promote an AMPK-induced tolDC phenotype. This work is inspired by studies demonstrating 1) that
the AMPK pathway is downregulated by intestinal DCs in T1D patients and 2) that activation of the AMPK
pathway via systemic administration of AMPK pathway agonists can successfully alleviate disease severity in
preclinical mouse studies. While AMPK has long been a target of interest for T1D, clinical development of AMPK
agonists has been limited by severe adverse effects associated with systemic administration including metabolic
complications (i.e. lactic acidosis) and cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, approaches like the ones proposed herein
capable of targeting AMPK agonists to intestinal DCs are vital to safely activating the AMPK pathway that’s
dampened in T1D, and restoring tolerance. Our preliminary data identify the AMPK agonist PF-739 as having
tolerogenic activity, marked by a dampening of pro-inflammatory IL-12p70 production coupled with a significant
increase in anti-inflammatory IL-10 secretion in LPS stimulated DCs, features that promote Treg induction. We
hypothesize that a treatment targeting AMPK-activating compounds to intestinal DCs will restore
intestinal tolerance and protect against T1D onset. Accordingly, we will prepare and characterize enteric-
coated nanoparticles of PF-739 (QR402) that we can then use for the proposed in vitro and in vivo studies.
Successful completion of this project will establish proof-of-concept for a first-in-class DC-targeted preventative
therapy for T1D. Data will be leveraged to support a Phase II STTR to prepare QR402 for clinical translation by
evaluating efficacy in the spontaneous NOD mouse model of T1D, and attract private investment. Qrono will
then develop QR402 through IND-enabling studies to prepare for future clinical trials in T1D- susceptible patients."

HIV infection remains a pervasive global health challenge, necessitating improved early diagnosis, swift access
to care, and consistent monitoring for People Living with HIV (PLWH) to reduce new transmissions. However,
a substantial gap persists in connecting and retaining individuals in the healthcare system, particularly in
under-served regions. The analysis of blood CD4+ T cell numbers plays a central role in healthcare
monitoring of PLWH, alongside measures of HIV load. To our knowledge, no commercially available home-
based mail-in CD4 count tests exist. The development of such a test would alleviate barriers to HIV testing and
monitoring, such as the need for travel to clinics and concerns about stigma, especially in underserved areas.
Founded in Louisiana, a state grappling with a high incidence of new HIV cases, Spotted Tech is committed to
addressing this challenge. The overarching goal is to improve HIV monitoring, healthcare management, and
facilitate rapid linkage-to-care in underserved areas by reducing the need for clinic visits. The primary ob-
jective of this proposal is to develop an innovative CD4 count test – the CD4-LINK Kit – where blood is self-
collected in the form of a dried blood spot (DBS) on filter paper and mailed to a lab for CD4 count analysis. The
central hypothesis is that the implementation of the CD4-LINK Kit in Louisiana will yield evidence of feasibility
and usability for the health monitoring of PLWH. To test this hypothesis, three aims will be pursued: Aim 1
focuses on assay development, optimizing solutions allowing for optimal cell recovery from DBS, and
assessing DBS sample stability under various storage and transportation conditions. Aim 2 involves in-house
test validation to assess precision and accuracy. In Aim 3, field testing at four Louisiana HIV clinics will involve
collecting finger stick blood samples and comparing their CD4 counts to those from fresh whole blood (gold
standard).
The CD4-LINK Kit is poised to stand out as the first-of-its-kind, addressing a notable gap in current testing ap-
proaches; traditionally, CD4+ T cell absolute counts are accessible only through clinic visits.
The underlying rationale for its development is to empower individuals to assess their CD4 counts
from the comfort of their homes, alleviating the burden of travel for those in underserved areas. This
innovation holds particular significance as it empowers people living with HIV (PLWH) to actively seek
and maintain HIV care, thereby improving health, fostering early intervention, and ultimately contributing to a
reduction in HIV transmission."

Protein kinases catalyze selective and timely protein phosphorylation and are essential for the normal
function of all cells. Unregulated kinase activity is directly associated with hundreds of human diseases,
including cancer; an estimated 30% of all new drug development focuses on this target class. Unfortunately,
although protein kinases are validated drug targets and kinase inhibitors represent promising treatments for
diseases, the challenge for small molecule drug discovery and development is that the current kinase assay
methods are inefficient and commonly only work under limited conditions. A significant barrier to progress
centers on the tools applied to assay protein kinases throughout the drug discovery pipeline. Although many
assay platforms exist, severe limitations in the various sensing mechanisms lead to substantial disconnects
in the discovery process, resulting in less well-validated clinical candidates and often limited efficacy in
treating disease.
The proposed research exploits AQT’s PhosphoSens® platform, a kinase assay for purified enzymes that
uses sensor peptides featuring a kinase-recognition sequence and a sulfonamido-oxine fluorophore
conjugated to cysteine (CSox) proximal to the (Ser/Thr/Tyr) phosphorylation site—the synthetic sensor
peptides report on phosphorylation via chelation-enhanced fluorescence (ChEF) in a time-dependent
manner. The PhosphoSens format addresses the limitations of the other kinase assays in a single platform.
This Direct to Phase II proposal will leverage AQT’s PhosphoSens and KinSightTM (a high throughput kinase
profiling platform based on PhosphoSens) for establishing commercial PhosphoSens® Lysate products.
For broad adoption, the new assays must address a range of physiologically and therapeutically critical
kinases, be compatible with complex cell and tissue lysate samples, and be straightforward to apply,
quantitative, rapid, reproducible, and readily run on standard laboratory microplate readers.
Aim 1 focuses on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which play critical roles in cell signaling,
including responses to proliferation and inflammatory signals that drive tumor phenotypes. AQT will
commercialize lysate-compatible sensor peptides for ERK1/2 based on Phase 1 product AQT0491. Sensor
peptides for eight other MAPKs will be developed and validated following Milestone steps 1-3, biochemical
validation, and deployment of sensor peptides to beta test sites for testing with complex samples (e.g., cell
or tissue lysates). AQT will refine sensor peptides as needed before commercial product release.
Aim 2 focuses on additional oncology-centric kinases. Lysate-compatible sensor peptides for PIM1/3 and
GSK3α/ will be commercialized based on Phase 1 products AQT0473 and AQT0157, respectively. AQT
will develop data-driven approaches to prioritize at least six additional protein kinase targets for sensor
peptide development and commercialization following approaches outlined for Aim 1."
11009406,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Global health agencies have identified migration as a common and key determinant of health and well-being,
with women disproportionately vulnerable to higher HIV risk and poorer health service access and utilization.
African American women are among the key populations hardest hit by the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and have
sustained markedly higher participation in migration compared to White populations for two decades due to
gendered and racialized trends. Data illuminating complex HIV service linkage barriers among migrant women
advocate for leveraging social networks as innovative avenues for HIV testing and treatment interventions.
This approach is particularly relevant given migrants' reliance on networks to relocate and the robust influence
of networks on social support and health behaviors. While network-based strategies have proven effective in
promoting HIV service linkage among diverse groups, they are currently untested, untailored, and unsuitable to
meet the culturally specific needs of African American migrant women. This K01 Mentored Research Scientist
Development application is among the first to examine the influence of migration-driven social support network
dynamics and characteristics on HIV testing and treatment (Aim 1) among African American women migrants,
aiming to develop (Aim 2), implement, and evaluate (Aim 3) a social network-based HIV service intervention.
The study site, Atlanta, GA, is a southern urban center with a disproportionately high burden of HIV incidence
and prevalence among African American women. It is also the most populous destination city for over 2 million
African American New Great Migration migrants. African American women, who bear the highest burden of
HIV risk, prevention, and treatment inequities among all other groups of women in the U.S., constitute the
majority of New Great Migration migrants. This K01 will provide necessary training in (1) advanced longitudinal
social network data analyses, (2) mixed methods, (3) social network intervention design, and (4) testing and
evaluation. These skills are crucial for achieving my long-term goal of becoming an independent scientific
pioneer who uses interdisciplinary and community-led methods to develop high-impact network-based health
interventions for African American women. The career development and training essential to launching my
independence will be led by a multidisciplinary and internationally recognized team of experts in mixed-
methods HIV research and interventions with migrants (Primary mentor: Dr. Carol Camlin), longitudinal
dynamic social network research methods and analysis in public health research (Co-mentor: Dr. Jim Moody),
advanced statistical analyses using multilevel modeling (Co-mentor: Dr. Tor Neilands), and HIV intervention
design, implementation, and evaluation (Co-mentor: Dr. Jae Sevelius, Advisor: Dr. Sophia Hussen)."
11009333,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Among the ~2.5 million persons who develop incident tuberculosis (TB) in sub-Saharan Africa annually, about
one in five does not complete treatment, even though highly effective treatments for TB and concurrent HIV are
now widely available. This contributes significantly to the high TB mortality worldwide, especially among persons
living with HIV. Clinical and public health guidelines universally recommend TB education and counseling (TB-
EC) to improve adherence to and outcomes of TB treatment and antiretroviral therapy (ART), but many barriers
to delivery exist. There is growing community interest in adapting peer-led strategies from the HIV field to improve
provision of TB-EC and outcomes of TB and HIV. We recently developed and implemented a multi-component
peer-navigation strategy for delivery of TB-EC among persons with TB with and without HIV in Uganda, including
(1) task-shifting of TB-EC to peers with TB; (2) restructuring of clinic workflows; (3) a TB-EC checklist; (4)
individualized adherence planning; and (5) behavior-change messaging. In a preliminary evaluation, we found
that the adapted TB-EC strategy was feasible and acceptable, and improved both TB literacy and treatment
outcomes. We now propose a 16-site, cluster-randomized, hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial to
evaluate the impact of peer-navigation on TB/TB-HIV treatment adherence and clinical outcomes among new
PWTB with and without HIV in Uganda. We will conduct these studies through the Uganda TB Implementation
Research Consortium (U-TIRC), an academic-public health partnership hosted at the Walimu non-governmental
organization and involving Makerere University, the Uganda National TB Program (NTP), New York University,
and Yale University. Our primary effectiveness outcomes include TB treatment completion and ART retention at
one year. Our primary implementation outcomes include TB treatment and ART initiation, adherence, and
persistence. We will conduct rigorous mediation analyses to test our hypotheses about the social and behavioral
mechanisms through which peer navigation strategy was designed to influence client outcomes. We will nest
convergent mixed-methods studies of implementation fidelity and context to understand provider and health
system influences. Our overall hypothesis is that peer navigation will improve TB/TB-HIV treatment adherence
and clinical outcomes compared to standard TB-EC by addressing individual and health-system barriers to TB
treatment and ART. These studies address several NIH research priorities, including overcoming barriers to
implementing evidence-based interventions for TB-HIV and improving medication adherence. We expect that
our rigorous design and implementation plans will provide high-quality data on the effectiveness and
implementation of a novel peer-navigation strategy to promote TB treatment and ART adherence. We will
disseminate our findings to participants, the Uganda National TB Program, and the global TB and HIV
communities to inform how TB-EC is offered to persons with TB/TB-HIV. If successful, our study will lead to
future work evaluating the impact, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness of the peer-navigation strategy at scale."
11009355,"Project Summary
Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) infections cause almost half of deaths due to fungal infection and are
responsible for 20% of HIV-related mortality. Even with access to the best available antifungals, cryptococcosis
mortality rates of 30% remain unacceptably high. Although natural immunity to fungal infection is quite efficient
in healthy individuals, disease in advanced HIV/AIDS patients is a complex interaction between 1) failure to
control fungal replication and 2) a qualitative shift towards a deleterious immune response.
The high mortality observed clinically suggests current antifungal drug treatments are inadequate in
immunocompromised individuals. This paradox suggests we are missing critical components of the Cn-host
interaction. Characterization of cryptococcal cells during infection has revealed that Cn produces a unique cell
type - referred to as “titan cells” - during infection that alter the host-pathogen interaction. These titan cells are
produced in response to the host pulmonary environment and are 5-10x larger than typical-sized Cn cells. We
demonstrated previously that titan cell production is critical for virulence and impacts dissemination to the CNS.
We further showed titan cell formation alters the host response by reducing phagocytosis and stimulating a
detrimental Th2-mediated response. The interaction between pathogens and their human hosts can be very
complex, and the outcome depends on both host and pathogen responses. The host must sense pathogen
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and then produce an appropriate immune response to kill the
pathogen. Conversely, the pathogen must sense and respond to the host environment to promote its own
survival. This proposal aims to identify critical alterations involved in the genesis of titan cells and their
progeny, as well as define how their unique cellular structure impacts the host immune response and thereby,
pathogenesis.
Titan cells have a number of unique characteristics, thus the focus of our proposed investigations is to
determine how these traits influence: 1) pathogen adaptation/survival in the host, and 2) the host immune
response. Our previous studies showed titan cells undergo ploidy changes associated with their formation and
replication, and lead us to hypothesize these changes are critical for adaptation and survival in the host
environment. Therefore, our first aim is to define the genetic changes in titan cell progeny cells that lead to
enhanced adaptation and survival in the host. In our second aim, we will determine how titan cells undergo
reductive division, testing the hypothesis that titan progeny contain only the newly synthesized copy of DNA.
The third aim will determine how titan cell formation alters the immune response to promote latent infection
establishment and reactivation upon immune dysfunction.
These studies will ultimately coalesce into multi-faceted antimicrobial therapies that combine targeting patho-
gen-specific processes to limit pathogen adaptation and modulation of the host immune response to maximize
beneficial host responses to reduce disease."

HIV-1 remains a major public health challenge worldwide, with 1.3 million new infections and over 600,000 AIDS-
related deaths in 2022. An effective vaccine that confers long-term protection against infection would be an
essential tool in eradicating AIDS, but all vaccine candidates have been largely unsuccessful to date. This is due
to the unique biology of the virus and its extraordinary ability to escape immune responses. The immune events
immediately following HIV-1 transmission have critical impacts on the ensuing disease course, but the underlying
biology has proven difficult to detail. Overall, the innate immune response to a viral infection can establish a state
of viral resistance and contribute to controlling virus replication, but it also induces inflammation that can favor
viral spread, immunopathology and disease progression. Studies of prospective cohorts of volunteers at high
risk of contracting HIV-1 have revealed the sequence of events during acute infection, including the cytokine
storm induced by the innate immune responses. Mechanistic in vitro studies have demonstrated the capacity of
diverse innate immune sensors to detect HIV-1 and induce cytokine production. However, the relative
contribution of each innate immune cell type and sensing pathway following in vivo HIV-1 infection, and their
functional impact on both the virus and the host, are largely unknown. To overcome this limitation, we developed
the MISTRG model of mice repopulated with a complete human immune system (“humanized mice”), including
monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and NK cells that are essential to mounting innate immune responses.
MISTRG mice are permissive for HIV-1 infection and recapitulate several aspects of the immune responses
observed in humans, including the cytokine storm triggered in the first few weeks after infection. Furthermore,
we have recently developed a highly efficient protocol to knockout genes from the human immune system of
MISTRG mice, providing genetic tools that were previously exclusive to conventional mouse models. Using the
innovative MISTRG model, we now plan to investigate the fundamental in vivo mechanisms of the innate immune
response to HIV-1, following infection through both intravenous and mucosal routes. First, we will identify the
cellular source of cytokines that are released during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection. We will complement
these descriptive studies with functional depletion experiments, to determine how each cytokine-producing cell
type affects the virus and the infected host. Second, we will use gene knockout approaches to determine the
functional roles of membrane-bound versus intracellular innate immune sensors in the response to HIV-1. We
hypothesize that different cell types contribute to HIV-1 sensing in vivo, that they rely on distinct sensors to do
so, and that their concerted responses functionally impact the course of disease. Our findings will address a
significant knowledge gap, and may inform the rationale design of novel innate immune interventions for the
prevention or therapy of HIV-1/AIDS."

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents an intermediate state between normal aging and the diagnosis of
clinically probable very early Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since MCI manifests before the onset of AD, it may be
the optimal stage in which to intervene with preventative therapies for AD and age-related dementia before
progressive neurological loss and irreversible cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, pharmacologic treatment for
MCI is far from satisfactory, highlighting the urgent need for new treatment solutions for MCI.
Baduanjin (BDJ) is a unique and innovative mind-body exercise characterized by the interplay of symmetrical
physical postures and movements, focusing on strengthening muscles and tendons. It consists of eight simple
movements that can be easily practiced at home when guided by videos /audio. These characteristics make it
a suitable option for older adults with MCI. Studies from both our group and others have demonstrated its
potentials for improving cognitive function for older adults with MCI. Nevertheless, studies also showed that the
response to BDJ varies significantly, some individuals demonstrate only a moderate response. To overcome
the challenge, this application aims to integrate BDJ with other mind and body approaches to develop a more
effective treatment option for MCI.
The goal of this Phase I R41 (STTR) application is to develop a computer-based multimodal mind and body
approach (cbMMBA) to improve the cognitive function for MCI. Specifically, we will first develop a functional
cbMMBA platform (prototype) integrating BDJ, acupressure, and relaxation techniques (Aim 1). We chose
these methods, not only because some of these methods alone have demonstrated their potential to improve
cognitive function in MCI / dementia, but because they also can interact with each other positively to produce
synergistic effects. Next, we will perform a feasibility study using the cbMMBA on MCI (Aim 2).
This application, if successful, will provide a cost-effective and easily accessible treatment option for MCI and
other age-related dementia, significantly improve the prevention of MCI development, and directly benefit
patients suffering from the highly prevalent disorder, particularly for those who may have limited access to in-
person mind and body interventions."
11007478,"Title: mVOR: An mHealth approach to the clinical assessment of gaze stability and telerehabilitation of
vestibular dysfunction
Abstract: Patients with vestibular dysfunction often suffer from gaze instability and an increased risk of falls.
Current practice guidelines recommend the use of vestibular rehabilitation for vestibular dysfunction. If patients
need to undergo home therapy, additional sensors and instrumentation can pose a challenge in supporting the
use of telehealth to objectively assess the contribution of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) to gaze stability
objectively. Following head velocity-based parameters for vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to be
effective in patients with dizziness and disequilibrium due to peripheral vestibular loss. However, head
velocity-specific goals can largely be ignored as part of home vestibular physical therapy because there is
no user-friendly way to directly measure head and eye motion without being connected to some form of
external hardware. Although there have been notable attempts to utilize virtual reality and mobile-based
technology to monitor postural balance and head motion, advances in native smartphone-based technology
and computer vision models could provide us the ability to develop a simple, patient-friendly approach to
assessing the VOR. In this project, we aim to develop a mHealth app (mVOR) under the guidance of
expert practitioners who specialize in the care of patients with vestibular dysfunction. mVOR will allow for a
self-administered vestibular dysfunction assessment by approximating the VOR with a well-established
psychophysical test, the gaze stabilization test (GST) protocol. We plan to develop a user-friendly mHealth
app that can provide gaze stability outcomes accessible by patients (mVOR: APP) and clinicians (mVOR:
DMP). mVOR will ultimately provide users with a single clinical outcome measure (GST score): the highest
head velocity (in degrees per second) at which they can maintain their visual acuity. Through the mVOR, the
user's smartphone front camera and microphone will accurately obtain visual acuity data and visual
processing speeds and track head and eye movements acquired by computer vision algorithms and human-
computer interactions. The mVOR: DMP app will graphically summarize results from the mVOR test
protocol, which may aid in further shared decision-making from anywhere. Human subject trials
performed at our partnering research institution (University of Virginia) will ultimately pave the way for
studying the usability, feasibility, and validity of this tool in patients with vestibular dysfunction best served by
home vestibular rehabilitation."

Use of alcohol and alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains high in modern American society.
It is estimated that in 2020 over half of the adult population (54.9% of those 18 years or
older) used alcohol resulting in 27.6 million adult Americans (11%) diagnosed with AUD.
The US Centers for Disease Control estimated the annual average deaths attributable to
excessive alcohol use to be more than 140,000 and the economic cost of AUD to be $249
billion. Current treatments for AUD include a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy,
medication, and other counseling. Currently there are four FDA approved medications for
treatment of AUD; disulfiram, naltrexone, extended-release naltrexone, and acamprosate.
Although it appears that approximately 25% of those with AUD achieve recovery (that is,
asymptomatic low risk drinking or abstinent) without treatment, those receiving any form
of treatment tended to have better outcomes. Unfortunately, only 1.1 million (or 4% of the
27.6 million eligible) received any form of treatment, with 362,000 (1.3%) receiving
treatment with an approved pharmacological therapeutic highlighting the need for
improved access to care and more effective and better tolerated pharmacological
treatments.
Preclinical and available clinical data highlight the potential of ANS-858, a selective,
reversible ALDH2 inhibition as a promising treatment of AUD.
The I-CORPS® Program will aid our team in gaining a deeper understanding of the
potential role of ANS-858 in the treatment of patients with AUD alone or in combination
with existing therapeutic agents. Furthermore, the potential overlap of emerging
psychosocial therapies and mobile apps on the treatment of AUD with ANS-858 remain
to be explored. Finally, although we anticipate adopting a public and private model for
reimbursement, the team is anticipating gaining new knowledge and information about
reimbursement to maximize commercialization."

The objective of the parent R01 Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in American (MASALA)
study is to identify how socio-cultural context, discrimination, acculturation strategies and resilience resources
act as risk or protective factors explaining cardiovascular health (CVH) disparities in Indian, Pakistani and
Bangladeshi immigrants. MASALA is a longitudinal study that involves participants completing a physical
exam, survey, and providing biospecimens. The parent study includes a qualitative component (Aim 3) to
“conduct in-depth interviews to elucidate how South Asian immigration experiences influence acculturation
strategies, resilience resources, and CVH.” While these in-depth interviews will provide important insights into
participant lives, the interviews may miss seminal moments that shaped their life trajectory and health status.
For South Asians in particular, there are historical (e.g., partition, Bangladesh war of independence, migration
out of South Asia) and contemporary sources (e.g., family dynamics, discrimination) of trauma. Building on Aim
3 of the parent grant, Dr. Naheed Ahmed’s diversity supplement application will use a life history interview
methodology to apply a trauma informed lens on lifetime sources of distress related to migration, violence,
discrimination, acculturation, socioeconomic status, and family dynamics with a sub-set of MASALA
participants (N=20) interviewed for Aim 3. Participants will be selected based on depressive symptoms from
the CES-D scale (low symptoms: <16 vs. high symptoms: ≥16). These life history interviews will provide rich
data on the lived experiences of participants, and how historical and contemporary events shaped their current
situation and health status. Participants, who complete a life history interview, will be invited to attend a
storytelling workshop to learn how to share aspects of their lives through creative mediums. After attending the
workshop participants will be invited to share their storytelling project in a community forum organized by the
study team. Research has demonstrated that storytelling as a public health intervention has the potential to
increase group cohesion, support, and promote healthy behaviors. The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1:
Deepen our understanding of intergenerational and lifetime trauma on depressive symptoms among South
Asians in the MASALA study by conducting life history interviews with 20 participants that have either low or
high depressive symptoms; Aim 2: Conduct a storytelling workshop using a strengths-based approach for
participants to share aspects of their life history interviews from Aim 1 for social and emotional support; and
Aim 3: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of storytelling as a mental health intervention using qualitative
approaches, and the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM), and social and
behavioral change models."
11011843,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a fatal cancer of the lining of the lungs that has defeated standard
therapies for decades. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are revolutionizing cancer treatment, and tumor-
specific neoantigens are critical components of the vigorous anti-tumor T cell responses possible from these
agents. Emerging clinical data show that ICIs result in meaningful extension of life in half of patients with MPM
but are associated with immune-related side effects. There is no reliable biomarker for identifying MPM patients
who will respond to ICIs. Such a test would avoid unnecessary toxicity, triage non-responders to potentially more
effective treatment, and could even extend long-term survival. Our preliminary data show that MPM tumors from
patients that respond favorably to ICIs are rich in 1) distinct cellular and tissue architectural features of MPM's
unique immune contexture, and 2) abundant tumor neoantigens that are detected at the peptide level and
expressed concomitantly with the specific HLA proteins that are required for their presentation to T cells. Our
central hypothesis is that response to PD-1 blockade in MPM can be predicted by a clinically-applicable
biomarker of its immunologic organization and requires neoantigen:MHC concordance. In Aim 1, we will apply
the high dimensional platforms of time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF) and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to
dissect the cellular networks and immuno-architectural features of MPM that govern response to nivolumab.
Based on these features, we derived a novel score that predicts response to nivolumab in MPM and we have
developed an innovative bioinformatics platform to abstract this score from standard formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) clinical tissue sections. In Aim 1, we will optimize and prospectively validate this score in
patients with MPM. In Aim 2, we will perform mass spectrometry (MS) on HLA-typed tumors to investigate
neoantigen biology and challenge the prevailing biomarker of neoantigen burden that is used clinically to predict
response to ICIs in other tumors, but with low accuracy. This biomarker has relied exclusively on neoantigens
predicted in silico and does not directly measure neoantigens in tumors. We found that high quantities of MHC-
I and MHC-II neoantigens detected by MS in MPM tumors (termed neoantigen abundance) correlated with
sensitivity to nivolumab. More interestingly, we found that the MPM tumors most likely to respond had high
peptide level expression of neoantigens concordant with high protein level expression of the specific HLA
proteins required for their presentation (termed neoantigen:MHC concordance). These novel metrics will be
tested prospectively in Aim 2 where we will also validate the immunogenicity of MS-detected neoantigens and
determine the phenotype of neoantigen-reactive T cells. Our results will define core elements of the
immunoproteomic structure of MPM and result in the clinical translation of innovative biomarkers expected to
directly improve the care of MPM patients. More broadly, completion of this project will advance our
understanding of neoantigen biology and of mechanisms of response and resistance to ICIs in human cancer."

The scale-up of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a prominent component of the U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic
Plan. Although Black women are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic, they are less likely to benefit
from PrEP. Further, the literature on evidence-based interventions to improve PrEP uptake among Black women
is sparse. The central aim of this MARI application is to refine and test PrEP-WISE (Pre-exposure prophylaxis
for Women In-charge of Sexual decision-making and Engagements), a novel, peer-led intervention designed to
increase PrEP uptake among cisgender Black women (BW) who live in New York State. Intervention mapping
(IM)1, 2 will be used to refine the intervention which will be grounded in the Theory of Gender and Power (TGP)
and Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model. This study will include 185 cisgender BW and 15 PrEP
providers (PP). The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1. Refine and manualize PrEP-WISE among cisgender
BW (N=25) and PrEP providers (N=15). First, we will conduct 6 focus group discussions (FGDs) (2 among
providers, 2 among cisgender BW and 2 mixed group) to elicit feedback on PrEP-WISE. Second, we will theater
test (TT) the intervention among a sub-set of the participants in the FGDs (N=15). Thematic analysis will be
used to analyze the data. Aim 2. Test PrEP-WISE among 160 cisgender BW using a 2-arm (1:1 ratio)
randomized controlled trial (PrEP-WISE and waitlist control arm) to assess efficacy on PrEP uptake at 3- and 6-
months post intervention. Aim 3: Assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and identify strategies
for scaling-up PrEP-WISE. We anticipate the intervention will include 4 modules: (1) Assessing HIV vulnerability
(self, partner, and environment); (2) Building skills to talk to providers and partners about HIV prevention and
overcome mistrust; (3) PrEP 101 and Combating stigma – no shame in taking action to reduce HIV vulnerability;
and (4) Personal Finance 101: Everything You Need to Know (a free 3-hour Udemy Course). PEP-WISE will
also provide BW with a peer-navigator who will use motivational interviewing techniques to help them problem-
solve and access PrEP. This will be bolstered with a WhatsApp support group, and transportation support ($20)
for visiting a PrEP Provider. All participants will be provided with the links to the CDC’s HIV Services Locators
and New York State Department of Health PrEP-AP. A MARI award will provide the support and protected time
required for a highly rigorous and intensive career development experience in designing and analyzing
randomized controlled trials. Importantly, it will build my capacity to transition to independence as an investigator
with expertise in developing evidence-based interventions to address HIV inequities among marginalized
populations. I have assembled a strong team of mentors and collaborations with complementary and integrated
expertise in HIV prevention, development of theory-based and culturally grounded prevention intervention,

New Hampshire Division of Public Health Services
Project Summary
The goal of the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is to reduce infant
morbidity and mortality and to promote maternal health by informing maternal and child health
(MCH) programs and policies, and influencing maternal behaviors during pregnancy and early
infancy. The objectives of PRAMS are: (1) to implement state-specific population-based
surveillance on maternal attitudes, behaviors and experiences that occur prior to, during and after
pregnancy; (2) to collect population-based data of high scientific quality; (3) to conduct data
analyses to inform programmatic activities and public health practice; (4) to translate and
disseminate analytic results into usable information for public health action; and (5) to have
capacity to respond to post-disaster or pandemic surveillance needs that may arise by
implementing a PRAMS survey supplement or oversample.
The objectives will be accomplished by ongoing activities such as: collecting data otherwise
unavailable; describing maternal behaviors, attitudes, and experiences during pregnancy and
early infancy; influencing public health policy by working with policy makers to incorporate
findings into the decision-making process; and committing state staff and resources to develop
expertise in the skills required to conduct surveillance.
The PRAMS methodology includes drawing a sample of women from the state birth file; sending
mailed questionnaires (up to three) on a specific timeline; following up all non-responders with a
series of up to 15 telephone calls over 30 days by a trained interviewer.
These goals, objectives, and methodology are in accordance with the national PRAMS protocol.
New Hampshire (NH) PRAMS staff will follow PRAMS research methods in the conduct of this
surveillance project to produce high quality data. A statewide MCH needs assessment conducted
in 2020 identified seven new soon-to-be-released priority areas that are the focus of MCH efforts
to improve the health of women and babies in New Hampshire over the next five years. These
priorities include a range of needs such as decreasing the use and abuse of alcohol, tobacco and
other substances among pregnant women, improving access to needed healthcare services for all
MCH populations, improving access to mental health services for women in the perinatal period,
increasing the focus of Title V on the Social Determinants of Health and the resolution of
barriers impacting the health of the MCH population, and reducing unintentional injury in
children 0-21 years of age. The information from PRAMS will fill critical data gaps and inform
policies, systems, and programs that address these and other MCH priorities."
11015755,"Each year ~2.5 million people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Also a prominent general public health
issue, TBI is particularly prevalent in Veterans, with 60-80% reporting a history of TBI. Over 80% of all TBI are
categorized as mild TBI (mTBI), which is associated with a myriad of short- and long-term complications. Two
of the principal complicating factors associated with mTBI are sleep-wake disturbances (e.g., insomnia,
excessive daytime sleepiness, and circadian rhythm sleep disorders) and chronic pain, including headache
and diffuse/global pain. Sleep-wake disturbances and chronic pain have an independent prevalence of ~70%,
individually impair quality of life, impede effective rehabilitation, and have staggering economic impacts.
Furthermore, there is a strong bidirectional relationship between sleep-wake disturbances and pain such that
impaired sleep exacerbates pain, which leads to greater impairments in sleep and worse pain. This vicious
cycle between sleep disturbances and pain, which is a particularly prevalent and detrimental condition in
Veterans with chronic mTBI, represents a central challenge precluding effective treatment and ultimately,
improving Veteran quality of life. Although there are pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies for
chronic pain, the presence of TBI significantly complicates the effectiveness of these treatment options, and
have significant adverse effects (e.g., long-term prescription opioid dependence, misuse, and overdose). We
believe there is profound potential to intervene at the sleep level, and, by improving sleep quality, enable
Veterans with chronic mTBI to better manage their pain and end this vicious cycle.
This proposal aims to apply a sleep intervention to improve chronic pain in Veterans with mTBI. We propose to
use morning bright light therapy (MBLT), a readily deployable, cost-effective, non-pharmacologic, and home-
based sleep intervention, to improve sleep-wake disturbances and therefore ameliorate chronic pain and
improve quality of life in Veterans with chronic mTBI. There is substantial scientific precedent for MBLT to be
effective in improving sleep quality, as outlined by a recent meta-analysis of 53 MBLT-based studies. Indeed,
the potential of MBLT to improve sleep quality in Veterans with chronic mTBI remains unexplored, and yet,
highly promising, especially in light of our exciting preliminary data supporting study feasibility and potential
effectiveness. Our central hypothesis is that MBLT will improve sleep quality and ameliorate pain, resulting in
improved quality of life in Veterans with chronic mTBI.
Specific aims designed to test our hypothesis are to determine the effect of MBLT on, 1) sleep, 2) pain, and 3)
quality of life, in Veterans with chronic mTBI. We propose to recruit n = 100 Veterans with mTBI from the VA
Portland Health Care System, randomized 1:1 to MBLT (10,000 lux light exposure for 30 min within 90 min of
waking for 4-weeks) or a no-light sham-MBLT condition (as previously published using the same
duration/timing). Sleep quality will be assessed through self-report questionnaires and 24/7 actigraphy
monitoring. Pain will be evaluated through self-report questionnaires and two quantitative methods
(conditioned pain modulation and pressure algometry). Quality of life will be measured through self-report
questionnaires. Outcomes will be assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up time point.
It is expected the proposed work will demonstrate MBLT is a viable method for improving sleep quality,
ameliorating chronic pain and improving quality of life, in Veterans with mTBI. Improvements in pain and quality
of life will positively correlate with objective markers of improved sleep quality. These data would demonstrate,
1) an effective treatment option, alone or in combination with existing rehabilitative efforts, in Veterans with
mTBI, and 2) sleep-wake disturbances may be implicated in the pathogenesis of these functional impairments,
thereby establishing greater precedent for targeting sleep as a meaningful primary and/or adjunctive
rehabilitative therapy."
11015959,"Project Summary 
The R00 phase of this project will be conducted at the University of California, Irvine in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, School of Biological Sciences. Sleep is crucial for memory consolidation and its benefit is most commonly thought to occur via the reactivation of memories, thereby strengthening the neural infrastructure supporting them. Theoretical accounts of sleep-related consolidation focus on the process by which memories are independently strengthened, but in natural settings individual memories never exist in a vacuum. Importantly, the context in which memories are embedded during encoding governs retrieval and decision making behavior. However, context’s role in consolidation has not been directly explored. The goal of the proposed project is to improve our fundamental understanding of memory processes by developing an empirically-based framework unifying models of context’s effect on memory and models of sleep-related consolidation (Aim 1). Additionally, the framework will be used to support translational interventions to alter memories during sleep. Aim 2 will attempt to reinstate a suppression context during sleep to effectively weaken memories. This effort will inform future work on alleviating memory-related symptoms in clinical populations suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
This project will combine novel techniques to selectively bias memory reactivation; machine-learning algorithms to decipher memory-related content from neural data; and neuroscientific methods for monitoring brain connectivity and rhythms in different regions and timescales. For Aim 1, functional MRI pattern analysis techniques will be used to reveal whether contexts, individual memories or both are reactivated during natural, undisturbed sleep. For Aim 2, the main behavioral manipulation used will be targeted memory reactivation, the unobtrusive presentation of learning-related stimuli during sleep, thereby enhancing memory. In one experiment included in Aim 2, individual memories will be embedded in a previously unrelated context during sleep: a reactivated “suppression” context (cued by an odor) will be presented with auditory cues linked to individual memories, hypothetically weakening them during sleep. An additional experiment will use a similar technique to try and alleviate distressful intrusive memories following a trauma manipulation in healthy participants. Taken together, these experiments should pave the way towards a richer understanding of the extent of memory reactivation during sleep, and toward content-specific interventions to selectively manipulate sleep, thereby improving mental health and wellbeing."
11007320,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects ~1.5M Americans, characterized by
persistent hyperglycemia requiring life-long administration of external insulin. T1D is caused by the immune
system-derived death of the insulin-producing β cells in pancreatic islets. Because insulin production is initially
sustained by a higher output from surviving β cells, overt symptoms arise when 80%+ of β cells have been lost,
making diagnosis only possible at a stage of advanced disease. Islet autoantibodies, the only established T1D
biomarkers, are valuable for assessing long-term disease risk. However, because they cannot inform on the rate
of β cell death, autoantibodies cannot precisely predict when the disease will strike. Therefore, a technology
capable of identifying β cell death during the asymptomatic stages of T1D would provide an invaluable diagnostic
tool for the early detection of T1D, allowing earlier intervention with immunosuppressive therapies and delaying
critical islet mass loss.
 To address this gap, Pupil Bio is developing an approach leveraging next-generation sequencing for
methylation analysis (methyl-seq) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Each cell and tissue type carries unique methylation
patterns, which can inform on the cellular origin of DNA molecules in a mixed sample such as cfDNA. cfDNA is
released by dying cells as a result of cellular turnover or of an active injury occurring to a tissue. Thus, detecting
methylation patterns specific to cell types that are not usually found in healthy cfDNA can reveal ongoing damage
to a tissue during a pathogenic process, allowing for non-invasive, specific early detection. Available technologies
for methyl seq-based early detection fail to achieve high sensitivity, and require high volumes of blood. We
propose that high cumulative sensitivity can be obtained by (i) combining a high number of methylation markers
with non-zero sensitivity, and (ii) implementing an amplicon-based NGS workflow that minimizes sample loss.
 In this Fast-track SBIR application, the Pupil Bio team proposes to first apply a custom hybrid capture
panel to validate thousands of candidate methylation patterns that are ultra-specific to pancreatic islets. In
parallel, we will build and characterize an initial amplicon-based panel implementing a novel algorithm for highly
multiplexed primer design in methyl-seq. Next, we will hone the list of candidate markers by identifying patterns
that are ultra-specific to β cells only via high-depth sequencing, and expand the amplicon-based panel to
hundreds of amplicons. Finally, after analytical validation, we will characterize the clinical sensitivity of the panels
by testing samples from recent-diagnosis T1D patients, and demonstrate we can achieve high sensitivity while
requiring small blood amounts. Completion of these studies will allow Pupil Bio to establish a CLIA lab and to
commercialize its test as a laboratory-developed test (LDT) for the early detection of T1D."
11007541,"ABSTRACT
Despite the major advances in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and HIV-associated
comorbidities, the adoption of newer regimens in children has fallen far behind that in adults. Consequently,
health outcomes of children living with HIV (CLWH) is worse than in adults. Of the CLWH receiving
antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 2022, 81% had a suppressed viral load, compared with 93% of adults aged 15
years or older. In the same year, children under 15 years old accounted for only 4% of all people living with
HIV (PLWH), but they accounted for 13% of all AIDS-related deaths. For decades, children were forced to use
adult formulations or poorly tolerated pediatric formulations with unacceptable properties (palatability, pill size,
pill burden, high dosing frequency), high toxicity profiles and low genetic barrier to resistance. Dolutegravir
(DTG) is a novel second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that is highly efficacious, safer
and easy to use with a higher genetic barrier to the emergence of HIV drug resistance. While DTG is a
potential game changer for children, the accelerated rollout of DTG-based ART in children in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs) occurred in the setting of limited research data in pediatric populations. Currently,
fundamental questions remain about the adequacy of the weight-band dosing of the generic pediatric DTG
scored 10 mg dispersible tablet, drug-drug interactions in the setting of treatment of latent and active
tuberculosis (TB) and overall long-term effectiveness of DTG-based ART in children. The goal of this
application is to address fundamental research gaps to assure optimal use of DTG in children and adolescents
in real-world settings. The following specific aims will be pursued: 1) To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and
safety of the generic pediatric dolutegravir 10 mg scored tablet in children with HIV with and with TB
coinfection weighing less than 20 kg. 2) To examine the pharmacokinetics and safety of weekly isoniazid and
rifapentine (3HP) in children and adolescents and the drug-drug interactions with dolutegravir in those with HIV
infection. 3) To examine the longitudinal adherence, virologic response and changes in body mass index, lipid,
glycemia, renal, and hepatic profiles in children and adolescents with HIV on DTG-based ART. The results of
this project would provide real-world data that has the potential to impact HIV treatment guidelines for children
and adolescents."
11010427,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Suicide is the fifth leading cause of death among U.S. children 5 to 12 years, yet limited research on childhood
suicide and suicidal behavior (SB) exists. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has acknowledged
this critical gap as a high research priority. A significant risk factor for the early onset of a first suicide attempt
(SA) is a parental history of SB. Although the familial transmission of SB is well documented, research
examining the specific mechanisms associated with familial risk is limited. Our ongoing NIMH-R21 study
(Cohort 1) is investigating factors related to the familial risk of SB in children, 6-9 years, with (PH+; n=100) and
without (PH-; n=100) a parental history of SA. This proposed R01 study will continue annual follow-ups for
Cohort 1 and add an additional 300 newly enrolled families (Cohort 2; ages 9-11 years; 150 per PH group) for
a total sample of 500 parent-child dyads. Youth will be followed for four years from mid/late-childhood through
early/mid-adolescence. Using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, we will examine the
trajectories of neurocognitive function (NF), emotional reactivity/regulation (ERR), non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), suicidal ideation (SI), and SA in PH+ and PH- youth along with contributions by sex and race. Study
participants at first assessment include youth 7-12 years. At last assessment, youth ages will range from 10-15
years. Both groups, PH+ and PH-, will be balanced by sex and race. Two main research aims and one
exploratory aim will be tested. Aim 1: Examine longitudinally how PH status is associated with trajectories of
NF and ERR constructs measured during mid/late-childhood through early/mid-adolescence. Aim 2:
Investigate the potential mediating role of NF and ERR constructs on the association between PH status and
offspring NSSI, SI, and SA. Exploratory Aim: Test sex and race as potential moderators of ERR and NF
trajectories, and on the association between PH status and offspring NSSI, SI, and SA. This proposal’s central
hypotheses are that (1) PH+ status increases vulnerability for developmental trajectories characterized by NF
deficits and emotional dysfunction/dysregulation; (2) these trajectories will mediate the association between PH
status and youth NSSI, SI, and SA; and (3) these associations between trajectories and SB/NSSI will be
moderated by both sex and race. The hypotheses are informed by preliminary findings from the ongoing NIMH-
R21 study, where group differences were found for ERR, SB, and NF. The proposed R01 study aligns well with
the NIMH 2020 Strategic Plan for Research with emphasis on Goal 2-investigating mental health trajectories
and inclusion of diverse samples. Completing the proposed study will assist with the identification of specific
mechanisms associated with the familial risk of SB, determine if sex and race moderate the associations
between risks and youth SB, and provide direction for targeted prevention strategies for high-risk youth."
11030224,"Fatigue is a highly prevalent and disabling symptom in MS that has no current FDA approved therapy.
Stimulants such as amantadine, methylphenidate and modafinil are commonly used “off-label” to treat fatigue
in people with MS (PwMS), but their use is limited by side effects and limited efficacy. Similar to the 70-90% of
the non-Veteran PwMS who are impacted by fatigue adversely, Veterans with MS (VwMS) are affected too.
Despite the wide spread use of MS disease modifying therapies, fatigue remains a significant cause of
disability, non-employability and poor quality of life in both VwMS and PwMS. There is therefore an urgent
need to develop novel ways to impact fatigue in MS. While the origins of MS related fatigue is likely
complex and multifactorial, we believe that mitochondria dysfunction and resultant neuronal energy
depletion may be an important contributor to fatigue in MS. A recent study evaluated the efficacy of the
mitochondrial cofactor and antioxidant supplement, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, also known as
ubiquinol/ubiquinone), for fatigue and mood improvement in MS. This study showed significant albeit modest
improvement in fatigue and mood in CoQ10 treated subjects as compared to placebo. Oral Mitoquinone
(MitoQ) is a more mitochondrial-specific form of coenzyme CoQ10 in which CoQ10 has a covalently linked
sidechain that imparts a stronger affinity for the mitochondria. The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate
the potential beneficial effects of MitoQ on MS fatigue. This research purposes to develop novel ways to
impact fatigue in MS and ultimately to determine whether treatment targeting mitochondrial function have a
potential to alter the symptoms or course of MS. The central hypothesis is that MitoQ with its mitochondrial
affinity will improve MS related fatigue as well as cognition, quality of life and mood by improving mitochondrial
function and resultant neuronal energy depletion in neurons. We propose the following aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine whether VwMS who receive oral MitoQ in comparison to those who receive
placebo have less fatigue after a 12-week treatment period as measured by MFIS Score.
Specific Aim 2: Determine whether VwMS who receive oral MitoQ in comparison to those who receive
placebo have improved cognitive function, quality of life and depression using Symbol Digit Modality Test
(SDMT), MS Impact Scale -29 (MSIS-29) and the Beck Depression Inventory–Fast Screen scores respectively.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the safety and tolerability of MitoQ in VwMS using side effects and blood tests.
Specific Aim 4: Determine whether plasma MitoQ levels in VwMS treated with MitoQ correlate with clinical
outcomes of fatigue, cognitive function, quality of life and depression and with blood based inflammatory
immune and oxidative stress biomarkers.
Research Design: We propose to conduct a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial to compare the
administration of a 20 and 40 mg once a day dose of MitoQ to a placebo, as a treatment to reduce fatigue in
MS subjects as our primary aim and to improve cognition, quality of life, and depression as secondary aims.
We will measure the difference from baseline in fatigue, cognition, quality of life, and depression scores and at
12 weeks post study drug initiation. Safety will be determined by assessing MitoQ side effects. We will also
quantify plasma concentrations of MitoQ 1 hour post-dose administration and evaluate blood immune and
oxidative stress biomarkers at three time points during the study and assess correlation with clinical outcomes.
Methods: The participation period for each subject will be 13 weeks: screening visit during the first week,
followed by a 12-week treatment period. The study will require 4 visits and 4 phone calls over 13 weeks. Total
time commitment is approximately 6 hours. Sixty adult patients diagnosed with MS will be enrolled. Subjects
will be randomly divided into 3 subject groups: 20 subjects receiving 20 mg MitoQ, 20 subjects will receiving 40
mg MitoQ, and 20 subjects will receiving a placebo."
11015986,"Project Abstract/Summary
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a serious chronic disease that affects 28 million Americans and costs $245 billion in
annual U.S. healthcare expenditures. Although previously a disease limited to adulthood, of serious concern are
studies showing that rates of adolescent-onset T2D are on the rise. Adolescent-onset T2D is associated with
greater health comorbidities and shorter life expectancy than adult-onset T2D. T2D is preventable by decreasing
insulin resistance, the major physiological precursor to T2D. Unfortunately, standard-of-care behavioral lifestyle
interventions to decrease insulin resistance through weight loss demonstrate insufficient effectiveness in
adolescents, necessitating alternative approaches targeting novel risk factors. One novel modifiable risk factor
is depression symptoms, a prospective risk factor for worsening insulin resistance and the onset of T2D over
time, even after accounting for obesity. Depression likely promotes insulin resistance through stress-related
behavior (e.g., hedonic eating, physical inactivity) and stress physiology (e.g., cortisol dysregulation, stress
reactivity). In theory, mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) may be distinctively suited for adolescents at-risk for
T2D through its potential to decrease depression symptoms, improve stress-related behavior and physiology,
and thereby, improve insulin resistance and lessen T2D risk. To begin to test this approach, we completed a
single-site, pilot randomized controlled trial (R00 HD069516) that established initial feasibility of recruitment,
randomization, retention, protocol adherence, and acceptability/credibility of a 6-week group MBI program,
Learning to BREATHE, among the target population. Compared to 6-week group cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT; a standard-of-care depression intervention), MBI produced significantly greater decreases in depression
symptoms and insulin resistance at 6-week/post-treatment follow-up and at 1-year follow-up in adolescents at-
risk for T2D. Directly building upon our prior work, the proposed U01 study is a multisite, pilot randomized
controlled trial implemented at four sites in preparation for a future multisite efficacy trial assessing the effects of
6-week group MBI, relative to another active treatment (CBT) and a didactic, health education control group
(HealthEd), on depression and insulin resistance, as well as stress-related behavior and stress physiology.
Specific aims of the current proposal are to: (1) Test multisite fidelity of training and implementation of 6-week
group MBI, CBT, and HealthEd, to adolescents at-risk for T2D with depression symptoms; (2) Evaluate multisite
feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, retention, and adherence for a protocol involving randomization to 6-
week group MBI, CBT, or HealthEd with 6-week/post-treatment follow-up and 1-year follow-up; and (3) Modify
intervention training/implementation and protocol procedures in preparation for a future fully-powered multisite
randomized controlled efficacy trial. Completion of these aims will prepare us to apply for a UG3/UH3 efficacy
trial. Ultimately, this research will inform a complementary and integrative healthcare approach to adolescents
at high-risk for T2D."
11007380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Carceral facilities, particularly jails, present a unique opportunity to address the public health crisis of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID). With two-thirds of PWID experiencing
incarceration in the United States and a high HCV/HIV seroprevalence in these settings, jails become a critical
access point for addressing the hepatitis C epidemic. Recent studies demonstrate the potential for low-barrier
HCV treatment models (e.g., the “minimal monitoring” MINMON protocol) to cure hepatitis C, even among
high-risk patient populations including those with active drug use. Despite this, HCV treatment in jails, which
are characterized by high turnover and short-term stays, is rare. This represents a missed public health
opportunity, contrasting with the success of HCV treatment seen in long-term prison facilities.
 This planning grant seeks to fill this critical gap by piloting an innovative, low-barrier HCV treatment
strategy in a jail setting. Coined “MINMON-J,” this approach modifies the MINMON protocol for use in jails.
MINMON-J incorporates take-home HCV medication and collaboration with a community Transitions Clinic,
leveraging community health workers (CHWs) to support patient navigation and post-release linkage to care.
 In Aim 1, the study aims to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of MINMON-J through a single-arm
pilot trial involving jailed PWID with HCV mono-infection or co-infection with HIV. Participants will receive rapid
HCV treatment initiation while incarcerated. Individuals released before treatment will receive all remaining
medication and CHW-facilitated peer navigation. Outcomes, assessed using the RE-AIM/PRISM framework,
will include HCV cure rates and various implementation outcomes to inform a subsequent stepped-wedge
Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial.
 In Aim 2, in-depth interviews will help characterize facilitators and barriers to low-barrier HCV treatment
in a jail to refine the approach for broader implementation in similar settings.
 This research serves to establish a transformative, community-informed strategy for HCV treatment in
jail settings, addressing a significant public health need. The outcomes of this pilot study have the potential to
shift paradigms in HCV elimination strategies, particularly for PWID and people living with HIV, aligning with
the goals of national health agencies, and contributing to the broader effort of HCV elimination."
11008200,"People are exposed to diverse chemicals through food, soil, air, water, consumer and industrial products. Some
individuals are more sensitive and/or susceptible than others. The goal of this project is to provide new cost-
effective screening solutions that incorporate human genetic diversity for chemical risk assessment. The “virtual
human population” screen will assess the variability in inter-human thresholds, and identify individuals that
respond adversely to lower doses of toxic chemicals or through different dose-dependent mechanisms. To
achieve this goal, we will develop and validate an integrated microphysiological screening platform (MPSS) with
a sufficient number of “representative humans” to elucidate the inter-donor variabilities using human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived organotypic culture models. Mitochondrial toxicity and acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
inhibition are well-established toxicity mechanisms that have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. A
recent analysis of the FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System for drug-induced liver injury showed that
mitochondrial toxicity is 1.43 times more likely to cause drug attrition and withdrawal from the market than other
mechanisms of toxicity. The brain is only 2% of body weight but consumes 20% of the available oxygen. It is
vulnerable to mitochondrial toxicity because each neuron has about two million respiring and ATP-producing
mitochondria (about 1,000 times more than a hepatocyte) and a limited regenerative capacity compared to the
liver. Our commercial products, Perfused Organ Panel microphysiological system (MPS), SeedEZ 3D cell culture
scaffold and synthetic hemoglobin increase cellular oxygen consumption 4-fold and the activity of CYP450 drug
metabolism enzymes 10-fold (compared to Petri dish cultures). This trifecta provides human-relevant oxidative
metabolism and drug metabolism outside of humans and makes the cells vulnerable to mitochondrial toxicity.
The 96-well MPS screening platform will use key elements of our commercial 48-well MPS and combine it with
our highly sensitive assays which detect toxicity at doses that are reported to cause adverse effects in humans.
Our assays and products discriminate between structurally similar, toxic and non-toxic drugs. This gives us the
confidence to asses potential dose-dependent transitions in the mechanisms of toxicity that can differ between
an “average” and a “vulnerable” human. The key deliverables will be dose-response curves for an array of mix-
and-measure biochemical assays, calculated IC20, IC50 and IC80, IC50 compared to TD50, analyzed potential
dose-dependent transitions and inter-donor variability, sensitive and resilient individuals identified, and data
analyzed based on groups looking at gender, ethnicity, and donor health. To develop the “virtual human
population platform” for chemical toxicity screening, we assembled a multidisciplinary team with the experts in
toxicology, pharmacology, genome biology, induced pluripotent stem cells, tissue engineering, organotypic
cultures, microphysiological systems, assay development and oxidative stress."
11007872,"Low-loss Bi-directional THz Couplers to Enable Affordable MAS-DNP-NMR
Abstract
The critical importance of solid-state NMR (ssNMR) was demonstrated by yielding the first atomic-resolution
structures of the A40 and A42 amyloid fibrils that play a crucial role in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Key to that
structure determination was a technique denoted as dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) with magic angle
spinning (MAS). This and many other examples show that developing transformational advances for ssNMR is
crucial for both structural biology and biomedical research in general, and for progress in curing Alzheimer’s
Disease and cancer.
High-field (>11 T) MAS-DNP systems thus far have all required the level of microwave power that is only avail-
able from gyrotrons. Gyrotrons have a narrow bandwidth. As a result, MAS-DNP then requires an NMR mag-
net with superconducting sweep coils. Thus, directly, and indirectly, gyrotrons add $2-5M to the system cost.
Moreover, the DNP methods are limited by the poor frequency agility of gyrotrons, and many crowded NMR
laboratories simply do not have space to accommodate a gyrotron.
Only 2-9% of the incident microwave power is dissipated within the lossy sample in the best published MAS-
DNP designs thus far, but substantial improvements will be possible with novel overmoded cavities compatible
with MAS-DNP that are under development. Such, however, would require a method of adjusting the THz tun-
ing and matching to minimize the reflected wave, which otherwise could quickly destroy the solid-state micro-
wave source, which though only a few percent the cost of a gyrotron is still expensive. Tuning and matching a
THz cavity in a cold MAS-DNP probe requires a low-loss high-directivity bi-directional overmoded THz coupler,
and such are not available. Available bi-directional couplers have 6 dB loss at 328 GHz. Using such would
mean throwing away 75% of available microwave power, which would render high-field DNP impossible with
solid-state sources for the foreseeable future. Preliminary simulations of a novel design indicate bi-directional
THz couplers with under 0.8 dB loss should be possible.
This proposed Phase I SBIR will begin with in silico optimization of novel low-loss robust overmoded THz bi-
directional couplers at the frequencies required for DNP up to at least 18.8 T. Prototypes will be manufactured
using novel methods involving 3D printing followed by precision machining and by gold plating onto plastics.
The prototypes will be bench tested over bandwidths centered about their respective design frequencies. A bi-
directional coupler for 328 GHz, driven by a 90-mW 328-GHz source, will be tested on an ultra-low-
temperature (ULT) DNP probe that is under development under a separate effort. It is expected that overmod-
ed bi-directional THz couplers, in combination with several other technological advances being pursued in oth-
er projects, will eventually enable MAS-DNP to be added to existing ssNMR high-field systems without the re-
quirement of either a specialized magnet or a gyrotron and thus will be affordable."
11007596,"Abstract
RNA interference (RNAi) – a natural biological mechanism by which eukaryotic cells control gene expression –
can be used to target and silence with high specificity virtually any expressed gene, making it a potentially
powerful therapeutic approach. Importantly, RNAi mechanisms utilize DNA/RNA sequences to specify its target,
enabling fine-tuned silencing of a single gene belonging to a family of structurally similar proteins that typically
share small molecule binding pockets. For these reasons, RNAi-based therapeutics have the potential to provide
effective on-target benefits while avoiding off-target toxicities that are commonly seen with promiscuous protease
and kinase small molecule inhibitors. Despite their therapeutic potential, the most challenging aspect of RNAi-
based drug development involves achieving effective delivery to the cells or tissues of interest, while avoiding
systemic off-target effects. Indeed, only a handful of RNAi-based drugs have received FDA approval to treat liver
diseases since this is the most readily accessible tissue for this class of drugs. More recently, alternative delivery
mechanisms, such as ligand-coupled oligonucleotides, lipid nanoparticles, viral vectors, and extracellular
vesicles (EVs) show great promise with the potential to penetrate tissues and have cellular uptake where they
can engage the endogenous RNAi machinery to induce gene silencing. However, a systematic method for
evaluating these delivery modalities in vivo has yet to be implemented. To overcome this hurdle, we generated
a murine model – the Optimus model, that contains a dual fluorescence reporter cassette where one reporter
harbors unique RNAi responsive elements. Using this Optimus model, we aim to generate an effective pipeline
to readily test an array of new RNAi-based therapeutic biologics generated by coupling our optimized siRNAs or
artificial miRNA scaffolds to established delivery vehicles, beginning with three unique modalities: 1) peptide-
based platform developed by SRI International for specific delivery to lung adenocarcinoma cells; 2) aptamer-
based modality developed by Aptamer group for the silencing in activated hepatic stellate cells under liver fibrotic
conditions; and 3) recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV) we previously generated carrying ubiquitous
and tissue-specific RNAi expression cassettes. Importantly, these delivery platforms have already demonstrated
successful delivery of oligonucleotide payloads, both in vitro and preliminary in vivo. Our collaboration enables
us to further test these new therapeutic biologics in live animals and assess their biodistribution, the features
that promote cellular uptake and enable trafficking of RNAi payload for functional engagement, and the systemic
off-target effects at very early stages of pre-clinical development. This research will define a new paradigm to
accelerate the creation of novel RNAi-based (and potentially oligonucleotide-based) drugs and readily evaluate
their therapeutic potential in live animals."

 The global market size for restorative dentistry is estimated to be around $20.2 billion in 2023 and expected
to grow to $36.2 billion by 2030. In the US, $2.8 billion is spent on restorative materials annually, predicted to
increase to $5.2 billion by 2030. To address such a demand, the most widely used direct placement dental
restorative materials are bisphenol A-glycidyl (meth)acrylate (Bis-GMA) resin-based composites. However, the
BPA leaching from Bis-GMA can lead to health issues like male reproductive abnormalities, heart disease, and
diabetes. In addition, these resins require utilization of reactive diluting agents to decrease their viscosity, which
leads to a significant curing shrinkage and stress, reducing longevity of the restorations. Thus, there is a strong
need to develop BPA-free alternatives with better performance than the currently used options. While significant
efforts have been made to develop BPA-free dental resins utilizing urethane (meth)acrylate monomers, none of
the proposed alternatives can significantly surpass the properties of the currently used urethane di(meth)acrylate
(UDMA). To close this gap, the PI recently invented novel urethane-based monomers, which if mixed with acidic
comonomers, reach virtually complete degrees of conversion (>98%) under ambient photocuring, and exhibit
mechanical properties 2 to 3 times better than that of the UDMA- or BisGMA-based resins. In addition to superior
modulus and strength, these resins possess notably better toughness and strain tolerance as well as low
polymerization shrinkage and stress. Such an excellent combination of properties makes them a very promising
alternative to Bis-GMA as the basis for dental composites. In Phase I, the collaborating institutions, Callentis
Consulting Group, University of Colorado, and New Mexico State University will determine feasibility of the novel
resins as high-performance BPA-free functional dental composites. Aims: 1: Narrow down the list of preselected
commercially viable composite constituents, both resin and filler components, and prepare the corresponding
samples for further tests. 2: Perform numerical modeling of the mechanical behavior of the selected resins and
their composites to determine optimal microstructures leading to the best performance, as well as uncover any
reinforcement-related issues. 3: Carry out experimental characterization of uncured resins and their composites.
4: Evaluate feasibility of the proposed material by measuring properties of cured neat resins and their optimal
composites, assessing any microstructural defects, cytotoxicity and testing remineralization potential of the
resins filled with hydroxyapatite particles. At the end of Phase I, the team will establish feasibility and commercial
viability of the proposed materials, as well as outline the optimal filler parameters to maximize the performance
of the proposed composites. Phase II will focus on comprehensive testing and refinement of the optimized
composites, as well as preparation of the innovation for transfer to practice as a high-performing, remineralizing
composite that uniquely fits the major unmet current needs. By removing BPA from dental restorative materials
and increasing their durability, this effort is aimed at improving the quality of life for billions of people."

HIV infection directly impacts both Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis and disease severity. Timely and
accurate diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) disease is critical for people living with HIV (PLWH) as TB
disease accounts for one third of all HIV-related deaths. Yet, currently there are no diagnostic solutions for
active TB disease that are rapid, inexpensive, and highly sensitive; and solutions that are available are
designed primarily as sputum-based solutions and optimized to detect pulmonary disease. This exacerbates
the diagnostic gap for PLWH, as PLWH are more likely to present with paucibacillary and extrapulmonary
forms of the disease. Novel point-of-care, rapid and accurate diagnostic solutions that have been optimized
and tested among PLWH are critically needed to reduce treatment delays and improve treatment outcomes.
Our central hypothesis is that the identification of the M. tuberculosis specific antigen, 10-kDa culture filtrate
protein or CFP-10, in circulating body fluids, specifically blood, is indicative of actively replicating bacteria, and
the detection of CFP-10 could potentially be used to diagnose both pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease.
Historically direct detection of M. tuberculosis specific antigens has been hampered by the expense and
complexity of detecting ultra-low concentrations of circulating antigens in biofluids. However, recent
technological advancements in chip-based electrochemical immunosensors have resulted in increased
sensitivity, options for miniaturization, and improved operational simplicity allowing for the detection of ultra-low
concentrations of target antigens in micro-volume clinical specimens.
Using seed funding from SD-CFAR our team developed a prototype Mycobacteria tuberculosis antigen
detection assay that successfully detected the M. tuberculosis specific antigen CFP-10 in a limited number of
clinical samples from patients with culture confirmed TB. While the initial success of this prototype assay was
very promising, more data is needed prior to any further clinical validation studies. In this proposed study we
aim to 1) determine the analytical performance of the prototype assay by conducting a series of laboratory-
based experiments using contrived samples to standardize the assay, assess its sensitivity and performance
parameters (dynamic range, precision, and repeatability), determine the specificity of the assay in the presence
of non-tuberculosis mycobacterium, and evaluate its storage stability: and 2) we will conduct a limited clinical
performance study of the prototype assay using 144 previously collected (72 from PLWH) and well
characterized clinical samples from the R2D2 network (with a pre-selected TB positivity of 50%). The low cost
and relatively simple approach of the prototype assay make it ideal for use at the clinic level as a low-tech,
point-of-care diagnostic. If ultimately successful, this assay has the potential to fundamentally change global
TB diagnostics."

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a persistent global health crisis, affecting approximately
39 million individuals worldwide, despite considerable advancements in prevention and treatment. While
strides have been made with antiretroviral therapies (ART) and other interventions, managing HIV
continues to pose significant challenges. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) have emerged as
promising tools against HIV-1. However, their widespread use faces hurdles such as resistance
development and complex administration. Consequently, exploring alternative strategies, notably
nanobodies, gains prominence in HIV research. Nanobodies, recognized for their compact structure,
effective tissue penetration, and unique epitope recognition, offer a novel avenue for combatting HIV.
This study concentrates on harnessing diverse nanobody development strategies to identify and engineer
these smaller antibodies, with a specific focus on targeting multiple sites on the HIV virus Env protein.
The primary goal is to bolster treatment effectiveness while simplifying therapeutic protocols. Empirical
evidence suggests that engineered antibodies, simultaneously targeting diverse sites on the HIV Env,
may outperform traditional bnAbs in efficacy against a range of HIV strains. Our proposal outlines three
primary objectives: first, identifying versatile nanobodies capable of recognizing various regions of the
HIV Env through advanced phage-display screening; second, conducting comprehensive
characterization, including neutralization studies, bioinformatic, and structural analyses, to deepen our
understanding of these nanobodies' mechanisms; and finally, enhancing their efficacy by leveraging
structural insights for rational design to broaden their targeting capabilities.
This thorough exploration into nanobody-based therapies holds significant potential to revolutionize HIV
treatment strategies. By potentially overcoming existing limitations and offering innovative pathways in
HIV management, these advancements could substantially impact the ongoing battle against this
persistent viral challenge."

11030597,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rising obesity has led to an unprecedented increase in pre-diabetes (preD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence
in children and adolescents, a worrisome trend amplified by the COVID 19 pandemic. Based on current evidence,
it remains difficult to predict whether children and adolescents with preD will progress to T2D. Our proposal aims
to address key questions in the pathogenesis of T2D, focusing on modifiable risk factors. Leveraging a
collaboration between Boston Children’s Hospital, Joslin Diabetes Center, and Massachusetts General Hospital,
in partnership with community health centers in the Greater Boston area, we propose to recruit a diverse cohort
of early pubertal youth (ages 7-15, n=300) with preD, elevated BMI (≥95th percentile), a positive family history
of diabetes, and one or more additional risk factors. We propose to combine rigorous annual clinical studies with
convenient remote assessments, to gain a granular understanding of metabolic, hormonal and environmental
factors contributing to T2D pathogenesis. In Aim 1, we will test whether measures of glucose homeostasis and
beta cell function differ between youth with preD who progress to T2D versus those who revert to normoglycemia
or remain preD. We propose to analyze glycemia and beta cell function using oral GTT and incretin hormone
levels, and assessments adaptable to community settings, e.g., continuous glucose monitors and home A1c kits.
In Aim 2, we will test whether fitness level and amount of physical activity differ between youth with preD who
progress to T2D versus those who revert to normoglycemia or remain preD. We propose to evaluate fitness level
using detailed clinical assessments, including VO2 max, assessments adaptable to community settings including
grip strength, and free-living assessments using wearables and app-based activity tracking. In Aim 3, we will test
whether evolution of body composition during growth and puberty predicts progression to T2D. We propose to
analyze body composition (total and visceral fat) using DXA, and hepatic fat using echography-based
assessments, gonadal hormones, adrenal androgens, and mediators of growth hormone action, as well as
assessments adaptable to community settings, e.g., BMI and app-based dietary surveys. As secondary aims,
we propose to create a data repository to allow evaluation of social and environmental factors contributing to
T2D onset at a consortium level, with measures including social determinants of health, neighborhood and
geographic characteristics (using geocoding techniques), and the environmental exposome. We also propose
the creation of a biological repository to allow multi-omics studies to identify genomic, epigenetic, and/or
metabolomic markers for progression from preD to T2D in youth at a consortium level. We propose to collect a
rich biorepository of longitudinal samples (i.e., plasma, PBMCs, urine, stool, hair) from all participants that will
set the stage for future systems biology-driven studies. Together, these studies will permit development of a
predictive model based on variables easily measurable at the community level, which can then be applied to the
detection and treatment of youth at highest risk of T2D."

Sex is an important risk factor to consider in concussion but has been historically under-studied. Computational
models of the human head transform external head impacts into regional brain strains that are well believed to
be the primary cause for injury. They are thought to offer more effective biomechanical mechanism underpinning
concussion. However, current brain injury models do not consider sex differences in morphology, either at the
organ level or at the microscale, axon level. Therefore, current brain injury models are not feasible to study the
biomechanical basis of sex differences in concussion. This proposal has two specific aims. First, we will develop
subject-specific brain injury models of the whole brain and axons. Next, we will use subject-specific head impacts
from male and female ice-hockey players to characterize sex differences in brain strain and extent of axonal
damage, and then correlate them with a range of biomarkers. Sex differences in both concussion and
subconsussion will be studied. The proposed research will provide an initial understanding of the sex-related
differences in strains sustained in male and female brains and the extent of axonal structural damages. Ultimately,
these efforts will contribute to refined health policymaking and sex-specific concussion mitigation strategies to
reduce the growing health-care burden."

healthcare-related careers. Significance: Due to concerns that the United States will not have the workforce
needed to meet industry demands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) related
careers, significant focus has been placed on STEM education. Across the US, the growing implementation of
STEM programs has quite visibility taken form through the addition of robotics, maker spaces, 3D printers, and
virtual reality into classrooms and after-school programs. However, the majority of the fastest growing
occupations are in health-related fields, and, thus, it is vital for STEM programs to also provide engaging and
diverse pathways to introduce students to health career opportunities. Phase I established the feasibility of the
proposed system and received overwhelmingly positive feedback from teachers. Hypothesis: We hypothesize
that a product that engages students in activities rooted in health science will increase interest and the belief
they can successfully pursue healthcare-related careers. Specific Aims: In Phase II, IDL will 1) Create a

11007709,"Project Summary
Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) proposes to develop an entirely new analytical testing device for the
quantitative characterization of lipoprotein particles in blood. Lipoprotein particles are the primary transporters of
lipids (phospholipids, triglycerides, fatty acids, and cholesterol) in blood and other tissues. Lipoproteins are an
important indicator of cardiovascular disease, as some classes of lipoproteins are responsible for transporting
and depositing cholesterol on the walls of arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis, a harmful buildup of plaque
linked with heart attack and strokes. However, the health risks of lipoprotein particles depend on their size, so
diagnostics tests must precisely quantify the concentration, size, and other physical properties of lipoprotein
particles in order to evaluate patient risks to cardiovascular health. Current standard cholesterol tests do not
measure advanced lipoprotein particle metrics, resulting in poor diagnostic power. Advanced tests that do
characterize lipoprotein particles are performed in complex and costly central laboratories by skilled personnel,
making them unsuitable for rapid, clinical, point-of-care, and/or repeated testing. EBS’ proposed technology will
utilize a compact, inexpensive instrument to characterize all blood lipoproteins (HDL, LDL, and VLDL) with higher
speed, precision, sensitivity, and lower cost than current commercial tests. This devices’ high-precision and
accuracy will provide new measurement capabilities to researchers studying the role of lipoproteins in
cardiovascular health, and the efficacy and biological mechanisms of cholesterol-lowering drugs and other
therapies. The high speed (minutes vs. days for central lab tests) and integrated nature of our proposed testing
device will significantly reduce costs, technician training, and assay time in central laboratories, and will one day
enable point of care advanced lipoprotein testing in clinics. These capabilities will improve cardiovascular
disease diagnosis and treatment monitoring, making this lipoprotein assay the new “Gold-Standard” for
cardiovascular disease/lipoprotein testing. With the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, even modest
improvements in diagnosis and treatment can save hundreds of thousands of lives per year worldwide."

Genomic information is becoming increasingly vital across medical specialties, carrying the
promise to revolutionize patient care. One major barrier to unlocking the potential of genomic
medicine is a robust infrastructure that integrates with electronic medical records (EMRs) and
supports patients and clinicians across the care continuum. This entails patient identification
and education, securing informed consent, facilitating test ordering, integrating and securely
delivering test results, providing ongoing clinical decision support (CDS) for clinicians, and
empowering patients with knowledge and tools to participate in their care1. As efforts to
incorporate genomic data into the EMR accelerate worldwide, products that successfully
implement a comprehensive, longitudinal, infrastructure for genomics are imperative. Genetic
testing for inherited cancer risk has been available for decades, is recommended by guidelines,
and has good payer coverage, making it an ideal area to pilot such an infrastructure. About four
percent of the US population is estimated to have inherited cancer risk.2 About 5-10% cancers
are hereditary, with heightened risk among adolescent and young adult patients (AYAs).3–10
Expanding testing criteria, calls for universal screening, and new service delivery models have
accelerated patient identification, but long-term management continues to be a challenge.
Uptake of recommended screenings for patients with inherited cancer risk, like colonoscopy,
mammography and breast MRI, range from 52% to 85% depending on surveillance type.
Uptake of risk-reducing surgeries, like bilateral mastectomy and oophorectomy, vary widely
between 9 to 65%.11 Adherence to screening and other risk-reduction actions also declines over
time.12,13 AYAs particularly struggle with adherence because of life stage transitions with
schooling, employment, and family building14 that necessitate transfer of genetic information
between care settings and clinicians, compounded by their need to find new clinicians with
expertise or self-advocate for care with non-genetics clinicians. Clinicians face challenges as
well, with guidelines for hereditary cancer updating often as our understanding evolves. Many
clinicians are not comfortable talking to patients about genetics15, resulting in calls for CDS
tools, which require genetic information stored in the EMR. The goal of this proposal is to
develop and study a software platform that provides an EMR-integrated infrastructure to deliver
longitudinal, genetics-based care at scale. Successful completion of this project will result in a
commercially available platform that stores structured genetic results in the EMR, provides an
interface for clinicians to develop guideline-informed and patient-specific care management
plans using CDS, and automates charting. It will also include a mobile-friendly patient
component to help patients across their lifespan to understand cancer risks, adhere to
recommended care, receive education, get reminders for care, and share information with family
and other clinicians."
11044033,"Over 37 million people in the United State have diabetes, and this high prevalence rate has contributed to diabetes becoming the seventh highest leading cause of mortality. Because the majority of people with diabetes are diagnosed with T2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes) and higher body weight is a primary risk factor, risk-reduction efforts have largely focused on weight management. Unfortunately, public health and health care professionals often use fear and stigma as tools when trying to motivate the uptake of health ­promoting behaviors. It is therefore not surprising that 42% of U.S. adults report experiencing weight stigma. Weight and diabetes stigma have been shown to be significantly associated with adverse physiological, psychological and behavioral consequences, however, reducing stigma is not part of the clinical treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes. Mitigating stigma therefore represents a key barrier to engaging individuals with type 2 diabetes in health-promoting behaviors and condition management. Self-affirmation, the process of explicitly of reinforcing sources of self-worth, is an evidence-based strategy for buffering one's self-integrity from psychological threats, like stigma. Interventions using self-affirmation theory have been shown to effectively promote a wide range of health behavior changes, including decreased alcohol use, improved nutrition, tobacco treatment, and HIV risk-reduction. The overall objective of the proposed project is to implement a self-affirmation intervention for stigma in a sample of patients receiving care for type 2 diabetes. My central hypothesis is that use of a self-affirmation intervention for weight and diabetes stigma will reduce the negative psychosocial impacts of stigma, encourage intentions to engage in condition management behaviors, and counter mechanistic pathways underlying the disease. This project facilitates the long-term goals of my program of research focusing on understanding how individuals perceive and respond to stigma-related stressors, and developing multifaceted interventions to mitigate stigma and improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes of patients with metabolic conditions like diabetes."
11020968,"Opioid overdose is a significant public health problem that has been escalating in recent years. Based on the
statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of overdose-related deaths
surpassed 100,000 from April 2020 to April 2021. This is a significant increase in overdose cases related to
natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids, and psychostimulants. Alarmingly, in the one-year period
leading up to April 2021, fentanyl was the top cause of death for adults between 18 and 45 years old, surpassing
fatalities caused by car accidents, suicide, COVID, and cancer. Methadone is a well-established medication that
has been used for decades to treat opioid use disorder (OUD). However, there is currently no continuous
monitoring device that can provide real-time information on methadone levels in the body. This gap in monitoring
can result in patients not receiving optimal doses of methadone, leading to relapse or overdose. To address this
problem, we propose a wearable device for continuous monitoring of methadone. Our proposed device is a
minimally invasive microneedle technology that can be worn on the skin. This device will continuously monitor
methadone levels in the body, providing real-time feedback to patients and healthcare professionals. The device
is small, discreet, and easy to use, making it ideal for use in various settings. The proposed SBIR project aims
to leverage our innovative microneedle technology to develop a wearable device that can continuously monitor
therapeutic levels of methadone in the interstitial fluid for a week. In order to achieve this, the team will perform
systematic optimization studies on the surface architecture of the sensor to enable highly sensitive, stable, and
selective methadone sensing performance. Aim 1 constitutes in-vitro feasibility studies to find the best chemical
modification strategy with high sensitivity. Aim 2 will involve extending the stability of the sensor to one week of
continuous operation. Aim 3 will assess the selectivity, reproducibility, and shelf life of the developed MN-based
methadone sensors in serum samples and involves further developments in the electronics and the
accompanying app of the device. Upon successful completion of Phase I, Phase II will focus on demonstrating
the utility and establishing reliability of the sensor via extensive clinical studies in both animals and in human
subjects. The device will not only provide accurate and personalized dosing of methadone but also help in
mitigating OUD by alerting patients and healthcare professionals when levels of methadone fall below or rise
above therapeutic levels. This will enable healthcare providers to adjust the methadone dose in real-time,
ensuring that patients receive optimal dosages to prevent relapse and overdose. The proposed wearable device
for continuous monitoring of methadone is a crucial innovation that will help to address the problem of opioid
overdose. The device will provide accurate and personalized dosing of methadone, help to mitigate OUD, and
can be used among different populations. Our proposed device has the potential to improve the quality of life of
patients, reduce healthcare costs, and ultimately save lives."

Physical organization of biomolecules within the cell is critical for controlling key life processes in health and
disease. It has recently been realized that in addition to membrane bound compartments such as the nucleus or
mitochondria, membraneless compartments may play a pivotal role in organizing biomolecules in the cell. Called
biomolecular condensates, these assemblies form by weak multivalent interactions and are known for their
spherical shapes and viscoelastic behavior. A biomolecular condensate can reversibly localize or delocalize
biomolecules in response to environmental cues. They can also interact with numerous biomolecules in a non-
stoichiometric manner. There is growing evidence suggesting that certain proteins in bacteria may function as
condensates. While they provide a means of compartmentalization for cells lacking traditional organelles, their
most impactful role could be as rapid response sensors. However, studying condensates in bacteria is
particularly challenging. Most evidence comes from laboratory-based reconstitution experiments that fail to
accurately replicate the true cellular environment, including context-dependent interactions. Due to the lack of
suitable tools, understanding the effects of condensates on phenotypes and inhibiting bacterial growth through
this novel mechanism have proven difficult. Current methods to assess condensate formation rely on
fluorescence microscopy, which is limited by the diffraction limit of light and cannot resolve structures smaller
than approximately 250 nm. Alternatively, proximity ligation-based assays followed by mass spectrometry are
often biased towards capturing strong interactions, thus neglecting dynamic interactions. In this proposal, we
aim to develop a novel approach that combines modular fluorophores and correlative super-resolution
microscopy to investigate the structure, dynamics, and interactome of condensates using genetically encoded
tags. Our goal is to apply this opto-proteomic toolbox to understand the role of biomolecular condensates in
various aspects of the bacterial cell cycle, surface colonization, and evolution within both free and host
environments. This approach will be readily applicable for the study of condensates in other bacteria and beyond,
while shedding light on the nanoscale mechanisms that impact macroscopic phenotypes."

Patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) frequently develop cardiovascular disease (CVD), and vascular
complications and endothelial cell injury is a common pathological event for both DKD and CVD. Therefore, the
development of novel treatments with dual cardio-renal protection is urgently needed. Krüppel-like factors
(KLFs) are a subfamily of 17 DNA-binding transcriptional regulators. Through unbiased screening, we identified
KLF2 as a highly regulated gene in the diabetic kidney. KLF2 is known to mediate flow-dependent phenotype
in endothelial cells, and confers endoprotective effects by inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways, thrombotic
activation, and uncontrolled angiogenesis. Due to these endo-protective effects, KLF2 has been shown to be
protective in CVD. Over the last several years, we have generated interesting data to support the critical role of
KLF2 in protecting GEC injury in DKD. We find: 1) KLF2 expression is regulated by many factors in GECs such
as glomerular hyperfiltration, high glucose, TGF-α, sex hormone, and SGLT2i. 2) KLF2 expression is reduced
in GECs of human diabetic kidneys and reduction of KLF2 expression is associated with the progression of
human DKD. Two missense mutations of hKLF2 gene were found to be associated with ESKD. 3) KLF2 has
anti-inflammatory effects and regulates eNOS expression in GECs. 4) Endothelial cell-specific KLF2 KO mice
with diabetes develop more severe GEC injury and DKD, while endothelial cell-specific overexpression of KLF2
has protective effects in DKD mice. 5) KO of KLF2 in endothelial cells also aggravates proteinuria and renal
dysfunction in the mice with unilateral nephrectomy. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesized that
KLF2 has a major protective role against GEC injury in DKD and KLF2 could be an attractive drug target for
treatment of DKD. To further test this hypothesis, we propose the following three aims: Aim 1: Determine how
KLF2 is regulated in diabetic conditions. Aim 2: Determine how KLF2 protects against GEC injury and
progression of DKD. Aim 3: Determine whether KLF2 agonists could be developed as a novel drug for the
treatment of DKD. These studies will help us to further explore the mechanisms of the endo-protective role of
KLF2, validate KLF2 as a potential drug target, and develop KLF2 agonists as a potential treatment for DKD.
We believe that KLF2 agonists could be eventually developed as a novel drug for cardio-renal protection in
diabetic patients with CKD/CVD."

This project aims to address the significant problem of bacterial pneumonia in goats, which is a
major cause of morbidity and mortality and represents a significant welfare challenge for
operations in the United States. Currently, there is only one FDA-approved antibiotic for the

can be utilized to determine a meat withdrawal period. Following completion of this work, we will
have completed all the work associated with all the necessary technical sections which we be
able to submit to FDA CVM for consideration for a label approval. The label approval of

 The wildland-urban interface (WUI) fire of August 8, 2023 in Maui has been the deadliest in US history. It
completely swallowed the historical town of Lahaina, claimed > 100 human lives, burned > 2000 structures, and
displaced thousands of people. The combustion of biomass, buildings, furniture, and automobiles generated a
complex mixture of toxic compounds including lead, arsenic, asbestos, cyanates, dioxins, and flame retardants.
These compounds are enriched in the ashes, residues, and soils in the burn site and surrounding areas. As of
January 2024, most of the burn site remained inaccessible to the public as residues/soils were deemed toxic.
Many of these toxic compounds are persistent in the environment, causing cumulative exposures years and
even decades after the fire. The over goal of this time-sensitive R21 project is to address fire victims’ current and
future health concerns. We formed an academia-government-community partnership to pursue the following
aims. Aim 1: To assess the impact of the fire on mental and respiratory health outcomes. We plan to enroll
child and adult participants from 100 fire-displaced households and 100 nonaffected households. Respiratory
symptoms, lung function, and mental health and wellness will be assessed using the NIEHS Disaster Research
Protocols (the RAPIDD toolkits) with modifications to clarify the specific disaster setting. We hypothesize that
individuals who experienced displacement would have worse mental and respiratory health outcomes than
individuals without displacement experience, adjusted by demographics, lifestyle, socioeconomics, pre-fire
environmental exposure history, and pre-fire health status. Aim 2: To assess the change in health outcomes
one year later, relative to baseline impact assessed in Aim 1. We hypothesize that individuals affected more
severely at baseline would have worse respiratory and mental health outcomes at follow-up compared to those
affected less severely. Aim 3: To collect house dust, wristband, and biological samples for future
investigations of longer-term health effects of cumulative and/or changing exposures resulting from the
disaster. These samples can be analyzed to capture important time windows of toxic exposure and biomarkers
indicative of toxicity and disease risk. They will be integrated in our planned R01 that aims to address lasting
concerns of the victims while studying the interactions between respiratory and mental health outcomes in toxic
exposure and disaster contexts. Overarching Aim: To report the study findings back timely to study
participants and the larger community. We will form a dissemination team with extensive experience in bi-
directional communications between researchers and the community. This team will answer participants’ and
community questions in a proper manner taking into considerations of culture sensitivity. The team will facilitate
receiving input from the community to help develop survey instruments and collect data and samples. The data
and samples will be an invaluable resource that can be shared with other researchers who wish to study WUI
fires that are becoming increasingly common.

 The occurrence of CRC in the United States shows a large disparity among recognized races and
ethnicities, with African Americans demonstrating the highest incidence and mortality from this disease. We
have observed a novel “loss of function” phenotype for the DNA mismatch repair protein MSH3 that is induced
by pro-inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6) to shuttle MSH3 from the nucleus (where it normally repairs DNA
microsatellites and double strand breaks) to the cytosol, where it no longer can repair DNA with coincident
accumulation of tetranucleotide microsatellite frameshifts (termed EMAST, elevated microsatellite alterations at
selected tetranucleotide repeats). These inflammation-associated microsatellite alterations are observed in
50% of all sporadic CRCs and is associated with advance-staged disease and poor patient survival. This
inflammation-induced somatic MSH3 defect is observed in twice as many African American than Caucasian
rectal cancers, and is associated with poor patient outcome. In this proposal, we hypothesize that MSH3
disruption contributes to the consequence of advanced stage and poor survival in African American CRC
patients. Our preliminary data demonstrates clear evidence that MSH3 participates in Homologous
Recombination repair of DNA double strand breaks as well as prevents aneuploidy. We have identified 6
unique somatic deleterious MSH3 mutations among African American CRCs that have not been reported in
public databases. And we have characterized that chromosome 9p24.2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is
associated with EMAST, and dramatically modifies survival of patients whose primary CRC demonstrates
EMAST and 9p24.2 LOH. In this proposal, we will examine the central role of MSH3 dysfunction in its
contribution to the survival outcome of African American CRC patients. Our aim is to assess the role of MSH3-
disrupted double strand break mis-repair among African American CRCs, determine the functionality of 6
unique MSH3 mutations observed in African American CRCs, and ascertain the contribution of MSH3-
deficiency with chromosome 9p24.2 LOH in the aggressiveness of African American CRCs. Overall, this
proposal examines the role and contribution of defective MSH3 protein that likely contributes to the poor
phenotype associated with African American CRC patients."

This proposal aims to enhance HIV prevention with a vaccine approach that promotes durable immunity. The
studies center on CD4 T helper cells within lymph nodes, crucial for humoral and cytolytic memory. Our objective
is to induce robust CD4 T follicular helper (Tfh) cells as they are essential for vigorous B cell activity within
germinal centers (GC). We aim to promote Tfh cells that facilitate differentiation of GC B cells to plasma cells,
essential for persistent antibodies, by fine-tuning the innate inflammatory response with adjuvanted
vector/protein immunization in rhesus macaques.
Our published studies in macaques have shown that stimulating specific Tfh1 cell subset promotes HIV Envelope
(Env) antibodies with enhanced persistence and avidity (JVI, 2020; eLife, 2023). In this proposal, we will examine
whether a vaccine platform tailored to promote Tfh1 cell differentiation during both the prime and boost, in
combination with trimeric Env antigens, enhances Env antibody durability leading to increased protective efficacy
20 weeks after final immunization. Our approach uses adjuvanted Clade A Env DNA (weeks 0, 4, and 8) to prime
Tfh1 cells. To intensify the Tfh1 response, a second group will receive an adjuvanted mRNA prime. Groups primed
with unadjuvanted DNA and mRNA will assess significance of Tfh1 priming in sustaining humoral immunity. All
four groups will receive Clade A Env protein boosts formulated in ALFQ (weeks 16 and 24) to reinforce Tfh1 cell
memory and drive sustained GC responses.
In Aim 1, we will perform detailed immune analyses across DNA and mRNA platforms to uncover mechanisms
of effective Tfh help in humoral immunity against HIV. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the long-term effectiveness by
measuring protection at week 44, 20 weeks post final boost. In addition to comprehensive cellular immunology
analysis of blood and lymph nodes and serological assessments in blood and mucosal sites, animals will be
monitored for potential vaccine-related adverse events. Our comprehensive and multifaceted approach, pairing
adjuvanted nucleic acid priming with a protein boost and directly comparing mRNA and DNA priming modalities
for immunogenicity and protection, aims to enhance longevity and affinity of HIV-Env antibodies. This innovative
strategy targets Tfh cells in a way not previously attempted, offering the potential for insights in HIV vaccine
development. These collaborative studies are supported by teams from the University of Pittsburgh, Emory
University, and Louisiana State University. These teams bring a wealth of expertise in adjuvanted vector design,
Tfh biology, humoral immunity, as well as bioinformatics and biostatistics. In summary, our studies, centered
around leveraging molecular adjuvants to enhance the Tfh1 cell response, have the potential to innovate HIV
vaccine design. Our long-term objectives are to integrate strategies to induce Tfh cells, optimized for B cell helper
function, into potent broadly neutralizing antibody-inducing platforms to improve HIV vaccine efficacy."
11013272,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Small molecule and protein signals provide a rich vocabulary for cellular communication. The production and
consequences of these signals are exquisitely sensitive to cellular context and microenvironment. Dissecting the
molecular dialogue between cell types is challenging, and new methods are required to address fundamental
questions: What is the downstream biological function of each signaling molecule? How is the biological function
different when molecules are present in mixtures or when different cell types are present in the
microenvironment? How do microbes—like the bacteria and fungi present in our bodies—affect the molecular
landscape? Our lab is developing new tools to probe these questions including (1) microscale co- and
multiculture methods that enable precise positioning of cell types to study cell signaling, (2) specialized culture
platforms for complex human-bacteria-fungal multikingdom culture, (3) integration of microbial co- and
multiculture systems with volatile organic compound (VOC) sampling to study how volatiles mediate microbial
dialogue, and (4) at-home biofluid sampling and stabilization platforms to probe the human immune response
over time. The present proposal expands our lab’s capabilities in areas (1) and (3), with the possibility to extend
to (2) and (4) in future work. This proposal will probe unanswered questions in two areas of human cell signaling:
(i) paracrine signaling between eosinophils and fibroblasts and (ii) paracrine/physical contact-mediated signaling
between neutrophils, monocytes, and B cells. Further, we will develop novel culture platforms that enable
microbial and multikingdom (e.g., bacteria, fungi) VOC communication and integrated sampling for gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. This culture system will, for the first time, enable
controlled spatial positioning of multiple microbial cultures, a user-friendly setup that can be operated with simple
pipettes, fluidic channels to deliver media and chemical stimulation, and integration of solid phase micoextraction
(SPME) fibers for VOC sample collection. Central to this proposal is the use of ‘open’ microfluidics and
spontaneous capillary flow. We are leaders in open microfluidics and have a strong track record of developing
user-friendly, cost-effective methods to perform microscale multiculture experiments within standard well plates
and cultureware familiar to biologists. The proposed work builds on our capabilities and embraces significant
engineering challenges in doing triculture with sensitive primary cells and innovating an entirely new approach
for study VOCs in microbial cultures. The proposed methods will enhance the understanding of the signals
involved in detrimental prolonged inflammation, critical to the development of better therapies for numerous
inflammatory conditions; they will also enable study of microbial communities that are essential to maintaining
human health (commensal microbes) and those that lead to disease (pathogens). Further, the bioengineering
and microfluidic approaches developed will translate to other biomimetic culture platforms and fundamental
signaling investigations."
11015520,"In patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) treated with the most commonly used
antibiotic, vancomycin (VAN), sustained clinical cure (SCC) rates can be as low as 50-60%.
Methods to identify C. difficile strains likely to fail VAN therapy are needed. Our long-term goal is
to develop clinically relevant CDI susceptibility measures predictive of patient outcomes. The
parent grant explores and identifies antimicrobial resistance contributing to these poor failure
rates. This project will expand these investigations into a newly identified resistance mechanism,
biofilms. Infections caused by biofilm-producing bacteria are notoriously difficult to treat due to
biofilms’ inherent increase in antibiotic resistance. Recently discovered by our group and others,
C. difficile can be successfully grown in multispecies biofilms using representative gut microbiome
species leading to a higher likelihood of in vitro CDI recurrence. Sessile C. difficile cells embedded
in biofilm can have VAN MICs that are 100-times or higher than planktonic (non-biofilm) C. difficile.
However, no studies have investigated a large number of clinical strains to assess the variance
in C. difficile biofilm quantity among clinical strains or an effect on patient outcomes. Our
hypothesis is that higher biofilm production decreases SCC rates. The central hypothesis will be
supported by two specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the variance in biofilm formation among
clinical C. difficile strains stratified by ribotype. This aim tests the hypothesis that biofilm
development will be variable amongst C. difficile strains within ribotype groupings. Quantification
of biofilms using the traditional crystal violet (CV) technique is ongoing with an innovative ATP
bioluminescent biofilm technique developed as part of this proposal. Aim 2 will determine if biofilm
quantity predicts VAN minimum biofilm eradication concentrations (MBEC) or sustained clinical
cure (SCC) in hospitalized CDI patients treated with VAN. This aim tests the critical hypothesis
that C. difficile biofilm formation is relevant in determining SCC. Biofilm quantitation will be
evaluated in multivariate models to determine whether biofilm quantitation is predictive of MBEC
values, SCC or both. We expect these findings will provide, for the first time, a biofilm quantity
and VAN MBEC susceptibility measure that is predictive of poor patient outcomes. The proposed
research will benefit the parent grant research by providing a tool to assess whether VAN
resistance caused by biofilm-producing C. difficile strains impacts patient outcomes. These
studies lay the foundation for the candidate to further expand into clinical microbiology
translational research."
11008460,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 By 2050, 88 million (20%) Americans will be ≥ age 65, representing a doubling of the population along
with 25% of all drivers being an older adult. Given that there exists a long preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease
(AD) lasting around 20 years, there is a need to develop low-cost modifiable behavioral interventions. The
proposed study expands on the substantial work by two teams: 1) Amissa Health’s NIH SBIR-funded research
platform that allows for remote patient monitoring through commodity smartwatches (e.g., an Apple Watch) and
2) The NIH/NIA-funded DRIVES Project from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis that uses
in-vehicle driving loggers to capture driving behaviors in individuals with and without preclinical AD. This study
aims to investigate the relationship between health-related data collected from the Amissa Platform and Apple
Watch among older adults coupled with driving behavior data to classify preclinical AD status.
 Aim 1 focuses on assessing the relationship between health-related data collected from the Amissa
Platform and Apple Watch and cognitive function in older adults with and without preclinical AD. A cohort of
cognitively normal older adults (≥ age 65, n=50) will be recruited from an existing DRIVES Project. The participant
preclinical AD status will have been determined using amyloid tracers via Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
In addition, neuropsychological assessments will be administered to participants to comprehensively evaluate
cognitive functions such as memory, attention, executive functions, and visuospatial abilities. Health-related
parameters, such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, sleep patterns, and physical activity, will be continuously
recorded using the Apple Watch and AmissaWear. The data will be analyzed to identify relationships in health-
related parameters and cognition by preclinical AD status.
 The goal of Aim 2 is to determine whether health-related data from the Amissa Platform and Apple Watch,
combined with real-world driving behavior data, collected from in-vehicle loggers, can predict preclinical AD
status. Participants from Aim 1 will be equipped with DRIVES chips to continuously capture driving performance
metrics, including speed, acceleration, braking, and lane deviations. The second Aim will integrate the collected
wearable health sensor data with driving data with the goal of developing a robust machine learning model to
predict preclinical AD status. This model aims to augment the existing neuropsychological assessment
techniques with lower-biased health sensor and driving behavior data and to better estimate cognitive decline
and driving risks among older drivers.
 This innovative research project introduces novel approaches, including the use of popular smartwatches
for data collection, a centralized biometric database for AD research, and the integration of health and driving
data. It aims to provide accessible and stigma-free data collection methods for participants while enhancing our
understanding of preclinical AD."
11007701,"Summary/Abstract: Recombinant protein therapeutics (RPTs) have proven to be an effective method
of treating a growing number of medical diseases/conditions. More than 100 approved RPT therapeutics now
exist, with a potential market expected to surpass $550 B by 2030. Yet despite current success and robust
growth, RPTs tend to be expensive to produce and difficult to administer. Underlying biology can fundamentally
limit the clinical efficacy of a relevant recombinant protein delivered intravenously. Moreover, RPT design has
typically been limited to the twenty canonical amino acids encoded by DNA/RNA triplets. Notably, evidence from
the small-peptide field and from our own preliminary work has established that the substitution of specific amino
acids with “unnatural” fluorinated analogs can increase thermodynamic stability of proteins above native levels.
Thus, Halide Biologics was founded to leverage the potential of chemical biology to enhance the pharmacological
properties of protein therapeutics and to capitalize upon the strong, NIH-funded initial work done by our co-
founders at the University of Iowa and Oregon State University. During this Phase I SBIR project, our
interdisciplinary team intends to establish proof of concept in applying targeted fluorination to the design and
production of novel variants of injectable RPTs in the field of inborn errors of metabolism. Performance will be
compared against relevant standard of care to determine whether targeted fluorination improves the stability of
target proteins to an extent predictive of meaningful clinical improvement. In tandem, we will utilize cutting-edge
techniques for stable integration to generate cell lines that enable production of fluorinated therapeutic proteins
with at least a 3-fold improvement in cost efficiency over the existing transient system. Phase I SBIR success
will lead to the identification of unique engineered therapeutic proteins bearing supra-physiological
pharmacological properties. It will also serve as a foundation for a larger, follow-on Phase II SBIR project that
includes in vivo safety and efficacy profiling. Phase II success will set the stage for a potential Phase IIB project
and/or Phase III commercialization with major industry and/or financial partners. The ultimate commercial goal
of these efforts is the licensing of our novel protein variant(s) to advance the treatment of a wide range of
diseases. Success in the long term will address a major commercial market opportunity and will greatly benefit
the human health and well-being of millions in the U.S. and internationally."
11008666,"Project Summary/Abstract
During this Phase I SBIR effort, we will assess the viability of shape-adaptive cochlear implant (CI) electrode
arrays as a new solution for achieving atraumatic cochlear implantation and optimal electrode positioning at the
same time. Lateral wall electrodes have historically been the preferred CI electrode option due to the higher
likelihood of achieving atraumatic insertion and preserving residual hearing. However, placing electrodes closer
to the modiolus of the cochlea can offer potential performance benefits, such as more focal stimulation and
reduced current spread, due to shorter distance from the electrode to the spiral ganglion neuron target.
Unfortunately, conventional perimodiolar electrodes suffer from higher rates of trauma and electrode
displacement (translocation), negatively affecting the preservation of residual hearing.
Here, we are addressing this long-standing challenge by utilizing shape-memory polymers (SMP) as a dynamic
element that induces programmed self-curling of the CI electrode arrays in the inner ear. This approach facilitates
gentle and gradual repositioning of the implanted arrays from the lateral wall to the modiolar wall without trauma.
By combining the advantages of both lateral wall electrodes (i.e., atraumatic insertion) and perimodiolar
electrodes (i.e., focal placement), the proposed technology enables reliable cochlear implantation and optimal
electrode placement at the same time, which is difficult to achieve with the current clinical CIs.
Our effort encompasses fabrication of SMP-inlaid, self-curling CI arrays, assessment of their implantation profiles
in a model cochlea as well as human temporal bones, and evaluation of insertion trauma by a histological
evaluation. We will rigorously validate our approach through mechanical and surgical analyses including dynamic
mechanical analysis and quantitative assessments of the insertion profiles based on macroscopic and
microscopic imaging."

The 22 million Asian Americans (AAs) are up to 5 times more likely to drop out of mental health
treatments prematurely and 50% more likely to report such treatment being ineffective
compared to their White counterparts. As such, AA young adults have been the only
racial/ethnic group with suicide as the leading cause of death. Since the onset of the pandemic,
AAs have experienced the greatest increase in the prevalence of depression and anxiety among
all racial/ethnic groups driven by the exponential rise in anti-Asian hate and violence, with 41%
of AAs reporting current anxiety or depression. However, 62% of AAs with current mental health
diagnoses do not have access to effective mental health services, due to a lack of
evidence-based methods for addressing cultural stressors in therapy. Despite the association of
deep-rooted systemic and interpersonal racism (e.g., perpetual foreigner stereotype and Model
Minority Myth) and bicultural tension widely experienced by AAs with poor mental health
outcomes, current evidence-based practices (“EBP”) are unable to effectively treat the impact of
such stressors for AAs. While efforts have been made to adapt EBP for certain minoritized
groups, none to date have been developed to address such stressors in therapy for AAs. Anise
Health is a pioneer in the technology-enabled delivery of culturally-adapted mental health care
for AAs. Preliminary data have demonstrated Anise’s ability to drive high patient engagement
and retention, resulting in statistically significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and
stress symptoms in just 8 weeks. We propose to challenge and innovate the current clinical
practice paradigms by creating accessible, culturally sensitive, and inclusive digital tools for
AAs. Aims: 1: Adapt and further develop evidenced-based, culturally-sensitive digital mental
health clinical tools that target the impact of race-based trauma and bicultural tension on mental
health outcomes for the AA community. 2: Assess clinician receptiveness and use of Anise’s
online platform tools for managing race-based trauma and bicultural tension with their AA clients
for eight weeks, and revise accordingly. 3: Evaluate the initial efficacy of the online platform
tools for managing the impact of race-based trauma and bicultural tension with 64 AA clients. A
successful outcome of this proposal will be digital materials that effectively address the impact
of race-based trauma and bicultural stress for AAs on Anise’s digital health platform. It will be
ready for a larger clinical trial and wider commercialization with partner institutions, which would
be the subject of a future phase II submission."
11008726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chikungunya is an arboviral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, primarily
the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus species. The virus responsible for the disease is the
chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a member of the Togaviridae family. First identified in Tanzania in
1952, chikungunya has since been reported in over 60 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the
Americas. The symptoms of chikungunya typically include febrile illness, joint pain, nausea,
fatigue, and rash. While the fever usually subsides within a week and the disease is rarely fatal,
joint pain can be severe and debilitating, often lasting for weeks or years.
 There is no specific antiviral treatment for chikungunya; care is based on relieving symptoms,
such as with anti-pyretics, optimal analgesics, and fluids. Prevention relies on avoiding mosquito
bites using repellents, wearing long sleeves and trousers, and eliminating standing water where
mosquitoes breed. Vaccine against CHIKV is urgently needed. Only one vaccine has achieved
approval, Valneva's IxchiqTM, which is based on a live attenuated CHIKV. This vaccine undergone
an accelerated regulatory approval by FDA with limited human clinical efficacy study.
 Many mosquito salivary proteins were shown to have pro-viral activity and can augment virus
transmission during blood feeding. We have found a mosquito salivary protein, AgBR1, that can
enhance viral transmission and shown that immunization with AgBR1 is protective against several
flaviviruses. Specifically, vaccination of mice with recombinant AgBR1 is protective against Zika,
and passive transfer of AgBR1 antiserum is protective against West Nile disease.
 In this proposal, we seek to confirm that AgBR1 vaccine is also protective against Aedes-
transmitted arbovirus of the alphavirus genera, the CHIKV. We will perform comparative
evaluation of different AgBR1 formulation, either recombinant protein or mRNA-LNP vaccine, in
preventing mosquito-borne CHIKV infection in mice. To ascertain the effectiveness of our vaccine
against CHIKV transmission, we will run our test on two murine model of CHIKV infection – (1) an
acute lethal infection model of immunocompromised mouse to see protective effect of the vaccine
against lethal infection, and (2) adult immunocompetent mice to see protective effect of the
vaccine against disease morbidity such as joint pain and arthritis. Our ultimate goal is to generate
a universal vaccine against several mosquito-borne diseases."
11008691,"Pediatric MR imaging is especially difficult due to motion-related artifacts in the images. Often
this requires general anesthesia in the clinic, which has been shown recently to be
detrimental to brain development. This places unique barriers on assessment of this
population for both clinical and research purposes. In this application, we propose the
development of the Next Generation Pediatric Neuroimaging (NGPN) technology, which will
allow for high quality MR images to be collected in the presence of motion, thereby
eliminating the need for general anesthesia while imaging. This technology will provide the
MRI contrasts for proton density, T1, T2, T2*, diffusion, perfusion, and fMRI. The NGPN will
be achieved by the development of novel hardware (RF coils and T/R switches), imaging
sequences, and image reconstruction tools. These advancements will allow clinicians and
researchers to image pediatric subjects in a safer, more reliable and efficient manner."

11009399,"ABSTRACT.
Despite advances in long-term antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV (PLWH) exhibit residual viral
replication and chronic inflammation that can drive a range of clinical co-morbidities. At the same time, efforts
to develop a vaccine that could prevent, control, or eliminate HIV have not yet been successful. To bypass this
problem, recent advances in CRISPR gene editing offer the possibility of engineering B cells directly, to secrete
custom antibodies such as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that control HIV. As a living drug,
engineered B cells could act as sensors, responding to HIV replication or vaccination, and secreting bnAbs that
could reach therapeutic levels. In addition, B cells play critical roles integrating the innate and adaptive immune
systems through antibody effector functions, presentation of antigens on both HLA class I and II, and by
providing costimulatory signals to T cells. However, despite the potential of engineered B cells to form a novel
HIV cell therapy, a potential barrier to their development is the suboptimal function of B cells in PLWH, which
includes defects in T cell help. A major goal of this project is to develop an approach to provide the necessary T
cell help and produce bnAb-engineered B cells that would be functional in PLWH. In Aim 1, we will design a
series of synthetic protein signaling molecules that engage B cell circuits induced by T helper cells, and screen
their function in reporter cell lines. In Aim 2, we will examine the ability of these molecules to drive B cell
functions in primary human B cells and tonsil organoid models of vaccination. Finally, in Aim 3, we will examine
the ability of engineered B cells to respond to and control HIV in a series of in vitro and in vivo models.
This project encompasses cutting edge concepts and tools of cell and gene therapy. The lab and environment I
have selected for this fellowship has both the facilities and expertise to fully support me in this endeavor. In
addition, USC’s clinical cell therapy program is supported by both a cGMP facility and a CIRM-funded Alpha
clinic, with training programs in cell therapy and expertise to help. The project also needs access to materials
from PLWH, waste tonsil samples and mouse facilities suitable for HIV humanized mice work, which are all
available in this environment.
I will also be afforded opportunities for training in a world-class clinical environment with mentors who
understand the challenges and immense opportunities afforded by a career as a physician-scientist. My
training plan integrates both clinical and research experiences throughout the different phases of the MD/PhD
program, to ensure that I gain the skills necessary to become a physician scientist with expertise in gene and
cell therapy, poised to use these new types of medicine in my own clinical practice and future research."
11010325,"Slow walking and cognitive impairment are prevalent among aging Veterans and are independent predictors
for subsequent hospitalization, disability, and death. Recent scientific evidence suggests that walking and
cognition are interrelated whereby their declines may share a common underlying neurobiological pathology.
Thus, treating slow walking speed may not only improve mobility but also cognition. Live Long Walk Strong
(LLWS) is a new innovative rehabilitative care program targeting Veterans (≥50yrs) with slow walking speed.
LLWS treatment primarily focuses on mobility problems. However, it is estimated that 40% of LLWS
participants have manifested cognitive deficits; thus, it is uncertain whether current LLWS treatment is
designed to optimally serve the unique characteristics of Veterans who have cognitive problems. For example,
we do not know whether Veterans with cognitive challenges will adhere to the rehabilitative program. Likewise,
we are unsure whether the treatment response will be the same across cognitive status. Therefore, the study
objective is to understand the treatment adherence, compliance, and response among older Veterans with and
without cognitive problems participating in the LLWS clinical trial. The present study will 1) provide insight into
whether LLWS treatment needs to be modified to increase compliance and adherence, 2) examine the
association between baseline cognitive status and change in gait speed after LLWS treatment, and 3) discover
the influence of LLWS treatment on cognition. The long-term goal of this proposed Career Development
Award (CDA-1) is to advance research and educational training in order for the PI to establish an independent
line of research developing personalized rehabilitative treatment to maintain safe mobility and cognition among
aging Veterans with varying functional abilities. The PI previously was the study coordinator of a NIH
supported R21 exercise treatment study and later conducted her own feasibility and quasi-experimental
studies. Currently, she is mentored by Jonathan Bean, MD, MPH, a professor of PM&R at Harvard Medical
School and Director of New England GRECC at VA Boston Healthcare System. The short-term goals of this
CDA-1 are to acquire experience in 1) rehabilitation science, 2) mobility assessment and treatment, 3)
neuropsychological assessment and analysis, 4) personalized rehabilitation treatment (geriatric care
principles), and 5) research methods and grant writing skills to establish a strong foundation for a VA-research
career. The PI will use the combination of didactic coursework provided from a rich academic research
environment, hands-on research training, and mentorships from a team of experts who can offer extensive
knowledge and support her research. The proposed research is significant and innovative as it provides
information about how to tailor innovative rehabilitative care to better suit the individual needs of Veterans."
11009473,"Project Summary
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is critical to maintaining the health and normal function of
photoreceptors, and is therefore involved in many retinal diseases that cause blindness. Throughout
life, RPE cells accumulate waste products that cluster into fluorescent lipofuscin granules. In Stargardt
disease, there is an acceleration of lipofuscin accumulation and changes in the molecular composition
of the lipofuscin granules. The fluorescence of lipofuscin makes it possible to visualize the mosaic of
RPE cells with an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope. However, characterizing RPE cells
from structure and intensity alone does not provide sufficient information about the health of the cells.
Measurement of the time delay in fluorescence emitted from RPE is related to the nature of the
fluorophores and their environment including the composition of lipofuscin. Development of adaptive
optics fluorescence lifetime ophthalmoscopy (AOFLIO) of the human RPE mosaic will provide an
important tool to characterize RPE cells in both healthy and diseased eyes, where structural and
functional biomarkers may be used for RPE evaluation, as well as diagnosing and monitoring disease.
This proposal aims to develop and establish the ability of AOFLIO to detect cellular-level changes
across the macula associated with healthy aging and Stargardt disease. Fluorescence lifetime will be
measured across the retina by comparing AOFLIO in adult human subjects ranging in age from 20 to
70 years. The ability to identify RPE layer fluorescence lifetime changes in patients with Stargardt
disease (10-30 years) and progression over 3 years will be assessed by longitudinal AOFLIO
measurements in regions of atrophy, at the transition zone and in clinically-normal retina. Some of
these subjects will also be imaged with a clinical prototype for widefield fluorescence lifetime imaging
ophthalmoscopy (FLIO), generating one-of-a-kind comparative data. In addition, the current AOFLIO
instrumentation will be replaced with innovative new technology designed to improve light efficiency
and resolve finer features than currently possible. This project aims to evaluate the performance of
AOFLIO, preparing us for future investigations to establish AOFLIO as an important measure of
biomarkers of retinal degenerative disease, establishing AOFLIO as a prospective endpoint for use in
clinical trials by providing rapid feedback on the effects of potential new therapies."
11009324,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy in improving mortality, persons with HIV (PWH) have shortened
lifespan and increased prevalence of non-infectious diseases including chronic kidney disease (CKD). HIV-
associated nephropathy (HIVAN) occurs almost exclusively in persons of African ancestry and variants of the
APOL1 gene, which confer resistance to trypanosomal disease, markedly increase risk of progressive CKD.
14% of African Americans have APOL1 high risk (HR) genotypes, which confer a 29-89-fold increased risk of
HIVAN among PWH, likely by predisposing glomerular podocytes to HIV-induced injury. Since most persons
with APOL1 HR genotypes never develop kidney disease, additional “hits”, including viral infection (HIV,
SARS-coV-2), exposure to high levels of interferon, and/or additional genetic factors, are necessary to initiate
progressive CKD. Our group was the first to identify a role for the ubiquitin-like protein Ubiquitin D (UBD) in the
pathogenesis of kidney disease (HIVAN). We reported roles for UBD in promoting HIV-induced kidney
epithelial cell injury and innate immune activation. A role for UBD in modulating kidney injury in APOL1-
mediated kidney disease is supported by recently published studies demonstrating increased UBD expression
in glomeruli in humans and mice with APOL1 HR genotypes and kidney disease and a recent report that UBD
increases APOL1 degradation in vitro. Our analysis of the UBD gene locus identified a haplotype comprised of
four missense mutations with an allele frequency of 0.43 in African Americans but only 0.02 in Europeans. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that this haplotype (UBDb) is associated with a 5.8-fold increased risk of HIVAN
in persons with APOL1 HR genotypes. Further, data from our laboratory indicate that there are important
functional differences in the UBDb protein compared to UBDa (reference allele). However, the mechanism by
which the UBDb variant synergizes with APOL1 risk alleles to promote kidney injury is unknown. Since UBD
can covalently and non-covalently interact with cellular proteins and increase/decrease degradation or alter
protein function, we will test our hypothesis that the UBDb variant increases the risk of HIVAN via changes in
interactions with APOL1 and other proteins, leading to podocyte injury. We will test our hypothesis and address
critically important questions in two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the effects of the UBDa and
UBDb alleles upon HIV-induced injury and inflammatory responses in novel human podocyte lines with APOL1
HR and non-risk genotypes. In Aim 2, we will use high throughput proteomics and targeted in vitro assays to
delineate differences in covalent and non-covalent protein-protein interactions of UBD variants and effects of
UBD variants on APOL1 protein ubiquitination and degradation in human podocytes with APOL1 HR and non-
risk genotypes. These innovative and important studies will delineate novel mechanisms underlying the
increased risk of CKD in PWH, allowing us to devise new strategies to prevent and treat CKD this population."

11009189,"HIV Drug Resistance in the New ART Era in Kenya Rami Kantor, MD
SUMMARY
Since the emergence of resistance to zidovudine in the late 1980’s, we have been in a race: an HIV drug is
developed and used, followed by the inevitable emergence of viral resistance to it, another drug is developed
and used, and so on. This largely resistance-driven process has informed antiretroviral drug development since
its inception. However, treatment monitoring, including drug resistance testing and at times viral load testing, are
limited in resource limited settings, where HIV burden is greatest, creating the global paradox: we test for and
know less about HIV drug resistance in locations where our understanding of it is most crucial. Such settings
may be more prone for resistance due to restricted monitoring in clinical care, higher treatment failure thresholds,
limited availability of advanced medications and formulations, circulating diverse HIV-1 subtypes, and special
circumstances like HIV-TB coinfection. Such situations might further enhance the risk to develop resistance and
exacerbate the complexity of addressing it. This paradox is even greater now that we are in the new global
antiretroviral therapy (ART) era. Remarkable progress in antiretrovirals like dolutegravir (DTG), with enhanced
efficacy, reduced toxicity, high barrier to resistance, and importantly, global accessibility, all instill a profound
confidence, suggesting that we may have achieved a pivotal milestone in the ongoing race against HIV. However,
the widespread utilization of DTG in all lines of ART, especially in settings with imperfect monitoring and limited
medication availability, raises concerns about continuing the drug resistance race. Emerging data confirm these
concerns and highlight research gaps related to resistance development to current era drugs and their magnitude
and consequences. This proposal is designed to address these gaps. Leveraging our long-standing North-
South collaboration, we propose to comprehensively and prospectively investigate the extent and impact of
transmitted and acquired resistance in a large HIV care program in Kenya, one of the earlier countries to enter
the new ART era in 2017. We hypothesize that the scale-up of DTG-based regimens across all lines of treatment
in resource limited settings is leading to a gradual escalation of drug resistance over time, impacting care. To
address this hypothesis, we will enroll and prospectively follow 1,840 Kenyan persons with HIV across the HIV,
ART and resistance timelines. We will characterize transmitted resistance (Aim 1) and investigate acquired
resistance (Aim 2) of 1st-line DTG-based ART (Aim 2a), 2nd-line ART (Aim 2b), beyond 2nd-line ART (Aim
2c), and special populations (Aim 3). Our understanding of resistance development in the new ART era is
limited, yet crucial to ensure its sustainable success. This timely Proposal will generate hypothesis-driven data
to address existing gaps and inform patient care towards ending the HIV epidemic. We expect to have a high
and direct impact on guiding future ART strategies to minimize resistance. The new ART era has been rolled out
for ~5 years, providing a unique opportunity to conduct this research. The right time to comprehensively
investigate resistance in the new ART era is now, to ensure that we don’t lose the race, in Kenya and beyond."
11030542,"Over 1/3 of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) who have undergone kidney or liver transplantation are
nonadherent to immunosuppressant medicine, a leading cause of organ rejection, graft failure, and death.
Despite the American Society of Transplantation's calls for real-time approaches to address immunosuppressant
nonadherence, there are no validated metrics using real-time adherence data (e.g., electronic pillboxes) to
identify those at risk for rejection and no efficacious interventions that leverage these data to improve adherence.
Hence, we will fill these critical gaps in nonadherence management by validating the new “Real-Time Adherence
Measure,” a novel instrument that could revolutionize how nonadherence is detected by linking the precision of
non-invasive, easily downloaded, timestamped electronic pillbox data to tacrolimus blood level standard
deviations (biological index of drug ingestion) to direct in the moment when immunosuppressant nonadherence
leads to rejection. We will harness this real-time daily dosing information in an adherence-promoting just-in-time
adaptive intervention (JITAI), a cutting-edge mobile health approach capable of fully incorporating AYAs' daily
electronically-monitored adherence to deliver tailored intervention content exactly when the AYA needs it most.
Currently, there are no JITAIs for this purpose. We will conduct this vital research, which involves using a micro-
randomized trial, a state-of-the-art experimental design for creating successful JITAIs. To develop our JITAI, we
will modify a promising existing intervention for promoting AYA adherence (sent adherence support messages
when dose was due) by triggering adherence support messages only when medicine is missed and providing
praise messages when medicine is taken. A JITAI-version of this intervention will be piloted with AYA kidney or
liver transplant recipients in a 12-week micro-randomized trial to identify intervention content and timing that
maximize the JITAI's impact on adherence. AYAs will be randomized after each electronically-monitored missed
tacrolimus dose to receive (1) an adherence support message or (2) no message. After each on time dose, AYAs
will be randomized to receive (1) a praise message or (2) no message. AYAs' engagement in the JITAI will be
qualitatively characterized to support long-term uptake. Our findings will address significant knowledge gaps in
how to optimally leverage technology to effectively measure and improve medication adherence for AYA kidney
or liver transplant recipients, reduce nonadherence-related rejection, graft loss, and death, and improve people's
health and quality of life. Dr. Eaton's study and training activities will prepare her to use advanced methodologies
to validate novel clinical metrics, design JITAIs, conduct micro-randomized trials, and improve mobile health
engagement. It is critical for Dr. Eaton to have support from this K23 to attain expertise in these innovative
methods and to achieve her important scientific aims. Dr. Eaton's career development activities will occur at
Johns Hopkins. Results of this study will provide essential preliminary data for Dr. Eaton's R01-supported full-
scale RCT of her JITAI and support her successful transition to become an independent investigator."
11013747,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe type of congenital heart defects, which is characterized
by the underdevelopment of left side of the heart. The clinical presentation of HLHS includes hypoplasia of the
left ventricle and structural defects in mitral valves, aortic valve, and ascending aorta. HLHS newborns usually
die within a week without surgical treatment. We and others have linked the pathogenic NOTCH1 mutations to
HLHS and calcific aortic valve disease. It appears that abnormal NOTCH signaling interrupts the communication
between myocardium and endocardium thus leads to incomplete growth of ventricular chamber. However, the
mechanisms by which NOTCH1 mutations results in hypoplasia of the left ventricle are largely unknown due to
limited models for studying HLHS. Genetically engineered animals are not capable of reproducing the clinical
phenotypes in HLHS patients. Previous studies have focused on the structural and electrophysiological defects
in cardiomyocytes from HLHS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which may not recapitulate
the underlying non-cell autonomous scenarios in the hypoplastic ventricles. In this proposal, we hypothesize that
NOTCH1-mediated myocardial-endocardial crosstalk is required for normal human ventricular cardiomyocyte
differentiation, and NOTCH1 mutations leads to abnormal myocardial-endocardial interactions which cause the
hypoplasia of ventricular cardiomyocytes in HLHS. We will employ an integrated stem cell model using HLHS
and CRISPR genome-edited iPSCs to investigate how NOTCH1 mutations lead to abnormal myocardial-
endocardial interactions in HLHS. We will design a novel co-culture platform using human iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) with distinct NOTCH1 genetic composition to
study the intercellular communication between endocardium and myocardium in both healthy and diseased
conditions. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which endothelial
NOTCH1 deficiency suppresses human ventricular cardiomyocyte differentiation and proliferation. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine how the crosstalk between myocardium and endocardium affects ventricular
cardiomyocyte differentiation and proliferation by co-culture of human iPSC-CMs and iPSC-ECs. In Specific
Aim 3, we will decipher the mechanisms by which NOTCH1 mutations results in the dysfunctional myocardial-
endocardial interactions and contribute to hypoplasis of the left ventricle using genome-edited HLHS-iPSCs. The
completion of this R01 project will have a major impact on the understanding of HLHS through interactions
between endocardium and myocardium using clinically relevant and patient-derived cardiomyocytes and
endothelial cells."
11012006,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Racial and ethnic minorities are overrepresented in the HIV Epidemic, particularly in the Southern United States.
Over the past decade, Hispanic and Latino Gay and Bisexual Men (HLGBM) in Georgia have experienced a
21% increase in new HIV infections, starkly contrasted with the 4% and 1% increases among Black and White
counterparts, respectively. Furthermore, at least five HIV molecular clusters have been identified in Georgia in
recent years, primarily affecting HLGBM. Our previous collaborations with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, state and local health departments, and community organizations revealed important barriers faced
by HLGBM in accessing sexual health services. These include scarcity of bilingual healthcare providers, distrust
in healthcare and governmental institutions, segregation, transportation barriers, among other important social
and structural barriers.
In response, our team secured federal funding and, in May 2023, launched a community-guided social media
campaign promoting a citywide bilingual peer-navigator program. This initiative focuses on connecting HLGBM
to accessible, affordable sexual health services across Atlanta. The program was well-received and ultimately
adopted by local health districts and users praised the program’s patient-centered approach. Nevertheless,
challenges such as extended wait times for appointments, scheduling conflicts, limited operating hours,
transportation challenges, and limited bilingual HIV care providers at all levels persist.
Our proposed project, “SALUD MOVIL”, builds on the success of the peer-navigator program, employing
technology, convenient laboratory testing, and robust community-informed and implementation-science
frameworks to tackle the social and structural barriers hindering care delivery among HLGBM. “SALUD MOVIL”
addresses the four pillars of the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE), and is aimed to RESPOND to the increases in
new HIV diagnoses and clusters in HLGBM, by applying Community-Based Participatory Research Principles
and Implementation Science Frameworks to inform the adaptation and integration (Aim 1) of a bundle of two
evidence-based interventions (EBIs): 1) Bilingual telemedicine for HIV TREATMENT and PREVENTION,
coupled with 2) Mobile HIV/STI TESTING and phlebotomy services. These adapted EBIs will then be piloted,
and implementation outcomes measured. Our goal is to develop a toolkit for broader translation, providing
guidance to scale the program and address HLGBM's social and structural challenges in other settings."

E. coli has played a vital role in the production of recombinant proteins and plasmid DNA (pDNA) for therapeutic
use since the advent of the biopharmaceutical industry. E. coli remains the workhorse in the production of
heterologous proteins and pDNA because of its short doubling time, its ability to grow to high cell densities and
its relatively straightforward scale-up potential. About 30% of all approved therapeutic proteins and 70% of anti-
cancer agents continue to be made in E. coli. As the need for high quality pDNA has increased due to success
in gene therapy and mRNA vaccines, there is a growing need for high quality, low toxicity bacterial strains for
production of plasmids. The goal of this direct to Phase II application is to develop a versatile next-generation E.
coli strain built using Scarab Genomics’ Clean Genome® platform that combines low endotoxin levels with
enhanced genetic stability characteristics for nucleic acid and protein production. Specifically, we propose to use
genetic techniques to substantially lower the level of contaminating endotoxin in pDNA and recombinant protein
preparations.
Scarab Genomics has developed and patented its reduced genome E. coli strains, which has removed 650
potentially contaminating proteins and all transposable elements. We propose to further eliminate genes that are
responsible for the activation of the Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4). We propose that phosphorylation sites on lipid
A and on carbohydrates on the LPS side chains activate the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay. These will
be removed and pDNA and protein products from this strain tested in a TLR-4 and LAL assay. Success of the
proposal will culminate in an E. coli strain that is low in endotoxin and increased genetic stability but continues
to generate high levels of nucleic acid and protein under fermentation conditions."
11008612,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
There is a compelling need for technologies that can quantitatively profile cell-cell interactions on a large scale,
especially the interactions of immune cells with tumor cells and quantify detailed measurements of crucial events
including cell-cell contact patterns, contact frequencies, contact durations, cell death, interaction-related
movement patterns especially pursuit, avoidance, arrest, movement failures, and target cell killing behaviors,
cell division, and others. The TIMING™ (Time-lapse Imaging Microscopy In Nanowell Grids) assay is a powerful
and versatile high-throughput in vitro assay that meets this need. In its current form, TIMING assay analysis
software relies on multi-channel fluorescent imaging to identify cell type and location. This imposes an inherent
limitation, as even the best available high-throughput time-lapse imaging instrumentation has 4 – 5 fluorescent
channels of which 2 – 3 channels must be devoted to labeling effector and target cells, leaving only 1 – 2 channels
for the customer to incorporate antibodies or probes of investigational interest. There is a compelling need to
free up fluorescence channels so the customer can incorporate 3 – 4 investigational probes concurrently. This
will greatly enhance the value of the TIMING assay for the customer by allowing them to study the localization
and dynamics of multiple investigational probes concurrently in their spatiotemporal context.
Achieving this goal requires computer vision methods capable of accurately and reliably analyzing label-free
phase-contrast video recordings to detect, segment, and classify cells, track their movements, detect key events
like cell death and mitosis, and profile cell-cell interactions while coping with focus loss. This will not only free up
multiple fluorescent channels but also reduce the phototoxicity, enabling cell co-cultures to be imaged over
longer durations and at higher frame rates. Finally, there is a need for the video array analysis to be completed
while the cells are still live (~ 2 hours maximum), to identify crucial cells of interest (e.g., exceptionally motile
serial killers) for robotic retrieval and downstream processing, including clonal expansion and transcriptomic
profiling. The goal of this project is to develop LF-TIMING (Label Free TIMING), an integrated computer vision
system that meets the above-mentioned needs, leveraging advances in deep neural network-based cell
segmentation, tracking, classification, and focus restoration methods."

CD4+ T cells and macrophages are infected by HIV and this infection correlates to more proinflammatory
activities that drive HIV comorbidities and end organ diseases. Mechanisms that bias innate immune functions
in HIV-infected cells towards chronic inflammation are poorly understood. We have demonstrated infected
primary resting CD4+ T cells and macrophages harbor defective HIV-1 proviruses that, despite having deletions
and mutations which attenuate provirus transcription, generate HIV-1 RNAs. The immunopathological
consequences of persistent aberrant viral RNA expression have not been addressed. We hypothesize that HIV
infection of CD4+ T cells and macrophages establishes a defective but transcriptionally competent
proviral reservoir that expresses aberrant viral RNAs which perpetuate persistent inflammation. We will
address this hypothesis in three specific aims: 1) Determine if persistent expression of cryptic HIV-1 RNAs
promote innate immune activities; 2) Examine whether HIV-1 and HIV-2 have different propensities for
generating intact proviral genomes and whether this influences immune activation; and 3) Determine if DNA
damage response mechanisms lead to establishment of defective proviruses. Successful completion of these
studies will provide general insights into the impact of HIV-1 persistence and expression in the context of CD4+
T cells and macrophages. Importantly, these studies will provide an understanding into mechanisms that
contribute to HIV-1 comorbidities which persist even with antiretroviral treatments and could lead to new targets
and strategies for treatments to improve the lives of people living with HIV."

Despite the widespread availability of low-cost, evidence-based preventative strategies like human milk
feeding, feeding guidelines and medication stewardship, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a chief cause
of emergency surgery and death in premature infants and disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic
infants. Under-resourced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) struggle to support staff education, a culture
that engages in quality improvement (QI), or access essential resources like donor human milk and adequate
nursing care. The intersectionality of these factors in concert with social determinants of health may contribute
to NEC disparities. NICU disparities are lessened with intense quality improvement, although equity-focused
quality improvement is rare. In 2016, the U.S. Legislature signed the “Expanding Capacity for Health Outcomes
(ECHO) Act” into law to spur “technology-enabled collaborative learning and capacity building models” and
accelerate the impact of these models on preventing disease and improving public health outcomes among
underserved groups. Our team has effectively implemented a neonatal Project ECHO (NeoECHO) which
supports implementation of NEC preventing best practices and our team has shown its benefits to reach NICU
clinicians in under-resourced settings. Using a stepped-wedge clinical trial design and engagement of patient-
family advocate partners and a national neonatal practice group, we will provide active facilitation via tele-
mentoring and working with local internal facilitators in 30 NICUs to examine the effects of a NeoECHO
approach to reduce NEC rates and impacts on NEC disparities within and across units. Aims will: 1) Compare
the effectiveness of NeoECHO to usual care on NICU-level outcomes for NEC and clinical care. 2) Describe
the structural organizational contexts and unit-level differences in quality outcomes at baseline and examine
their contribution to intervention effectiveness. 3) Evaluate NeoECHO implementation (including features of
engagement, reach, number of recommended practices adopted and embedded in practice, retention of NICUs
in the program, effect on clinician confidence, and cost). Using an implementation determinant framework
known as the Health Equity Implementation Framework, we will qualitatively explore the barriers and
facilitators to implementation of NeoECHO to allow for a more contextual understanding of implementation
disparities. Our pragmatic, experimental design will expand the evidence base on both effectiveness and
implementation of ECHO and contribute to the AHRQ mission by addressing modifiable risk factors to reduce
disparities in the incidence of NEC; leveraging telehealth-delivered mentoring to facilitate adoption of EBP by
removing accessibility barriers; and offering at-the-shoulder support for NICUs most in need. This application is
responsive to the AHRQ Special Emphasis to Advance Health and Healthcare Equity (NOT-HS-23-013),
informing the advancement of equitable neonatal healthcare quality using implementation science."

 Western Kentucky University offers undergraduate (B.S.) and graduate (M.S.) Environmental and
Occupational Health Science (EOHS) Programs that are driven by the shortage of trained occupational safety
and health (OSH) and environmental health and safety (EHS) professionals, in underserved regions of
Kentucky, that will advance worker safety and health. These programs have dedicated regional support
through the EOHS Advisory Board, industries, agencies, first responders, municipalities, schools, colleges,
universities, and communities. The success rate of graduates from each program, the inclusion of
underrepresented trainees, as well as the accreditation of the graduate program by the National Environmental
Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council, has established the credibility of the institution to offer
each curriculum. Both the undergraduate and graduate EOHS Programs are supported by the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) through a Training Project Grant (TPG). A critical need in
the region is to create a more diverse EOHS workforce, especially in underserved rural areas. Continuance of
the WKU NIOSH TPG will assist in meeting this need and provide opportunities for innovative educational
strategies relevant to contemporary work exposures, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the recent tornado
disaster in Kentucky.

Emerging findings by us and others have revealed critical non-lethal functions of caspases across diverse
animal phyla. Our published and unpublished findings indicate marked roles for caspases in ensuring
multiple aspects of development including cell-cell communication, cell migration, protein homeostasis, and
regulating stress responses. Moreover, our data indicate that a caspase target expressed in the same cell
at the same time as the caspase may not be acted upon by the caspase until a specific developmental time
point suggesting additional layers of regulation. It is not known how specific non-lethal caspase functions
are mediated. Based on our recent findings, it is likely that caspases require other components, such as E3
ligases, to execute these non-lethal functions. We hypothesize that caspases function in complexes with
other proteins that confer non-apoptotic specificity according to developmental stage, tissue type, and
environmental status. Over the next five years, the critical goals for my lab are to: 1) identify how caspase
modulates p38 MAPK-mediated signaling network to support neuronal integrity, 2) understand how UBR E3
ligases coordinately regulate cell fate, and 3) identify novel caspase functions in gene expression and
metabolic regulation. Our proposed cross-disciplinary studies include genetic screens, biochemical

A key challenge in medicine is identifying individuals who will benefit the most from treatment. Despite the
effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), patients experience side effects that challenge
future treatment strategies. Since most drugs' therapeutic and toxic effects are directly related to drug
exposure, identifying predictors of exposure can help better predict variability in response to medication. For
the proposed project, we are leveraging the unprecedented time-series plasma samples collected during
ongoing (AI153007) intensive pharmacokinetic (iPK) studies of dolutegravir (DTG) and tenofovir alafenamide
fumarate (TAF), a prodrug of tenofovir (TFV), in representative and understudied HIV+ men and women in the
multi-ethnic cohort MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS). Given the recent development in the field
of pharmacometabolomic, where endogenous metabolite concentrations in plasma are shown to predict
response to sertraline, escitalopram, and aspirin, we plan to determine the plasma metabolome profile of
MWCSS participants treated with DTG and TAF. Our immediate objective is to identify, through correlations of
plasma drug concentrations with endogenous metabolite plasma levels. These genes control metabolic
pathways affecting DTG, TFV plasma, and tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-dp) intracellular concentrations and
their associated metabolic adverse effects (i.e., weight gain and insulin resistance). To achieve our immediate
objective, we have three specific aims. In aim 1, we plan to identify endogenous metabolites associated with
concentrations of DTG (n=60), TFV, and TFV-dp (n~42) at nine different time points in virally suppressed HIV+
men and women under actual use conditions. Using these correlated metabolites as biomarkers of medication
concentration, in aim 2, we will identify, through genome-wide association analyses, novel genetic variants
impacting metabolite concentrations in 16,322 individuals from two independent population-based cohorts from
the United Kingdom (UK): The UK National Institute of Health Research and Twins UK. The extensive UK
sample size provides ample power to identify gene-metabolite associations reliably, offering a higher-resolution
picture of metabolism and elimination for DTG and TAF. In aim 3, the effect of identified novel genes on DTG,
TFV, and TFV-dp concentrations and their associated metabolic adverse effects (i.e., weight gain, insulin
resistance) will be further validated in 1157 MWCSS women and men treated with these medications. This
novel approach will help identify new genes impacting DTG and TFV plasma exposure and clinically significant
adverse effects. The deliverables from this study will positively impact future studies in the field of PGx of anti-
HIV medication and beyond in two ways: First, we will characterize for the first time and with much higher
resolution the primary and secondary metabolic and elimination pathways relevant to DTG and TFV and
second, it will provide a novel multi-omic study design that can be implemented to discover genetic factors
associated with drug effect."

One in five youth in the US has obesity, which is associated with reduced quality of life and significant
comorbidities, including what were once adult-onset diseases (e.g., Type 2 Diabetes). Effective treatments exist,
such as Family-based Behavioral Treatment (FBT), an evidence-based intervention for children with obesity and
their caregivers. However, treatments are not widely or equitably distributed; most youth with obesity do not
receive effective care. Technology can be leveraged to bring pediatric obesity interventions into real-world
practice, creating meaningful and sustainable public health impact by addressing barriers to treatment (e.g., lack
of providers, logistical barriers). Digital support tools for the caregiver and youth would further facilitate effective
implementation of the intervention by fostering learning and skill development, thereby increasing the scalability
of evidence-based interventions without sacrificing fidelity. This SBIR aims to address gaps in treatment access
by creating a digital training and delivery package for dissemination and implementation of FBT at scale. Through
recently secured CDC funding, we have developed and tested a professional e-training platform for FBT. The
primary goal of this SBIR Direct to Phase II is to expand upon the existing training platform to create an “all-in-
one” digital product, FBT 2.0, that offers an integrated suite of intervention components, including (a) dynamic,
personalized, self-paced program for children and parent/caregivers; (b) e-training and ongoing support for
interventionists; and (c) family engagement and monitoring tools for interventionists. We will create a
comprehensive, e-learning digital intervention with engaging, interactive, and personalized online tools for youth
and their parents/caregivers that are integrated into the broader interventionist platform. A direct to Phase II was
deemed appropriate given (1) FBT is an established and effective intervention in line with U. S. Preventive
Services Task Force obesity-care recommendations, with an already developed digital training platform; (2) prior
research demonstrating high usability and engagement of 3C Institute’s proprietary dynamic e-learning platform
for a broad array of end users; and (3) 3C’s considerable experience developing, testing, and commercializing
innovative e-learning software products. This SBIR Direct to Phase II project will accomplish three specific aims:
(1) develop the full FBT 2.0 digital platform through iterative usability testing with twenty youth/caregiver dyads
(i.e., youth aged 6-18 years of age with obesity and one parent/caregiver); (2) conduct a 6-month randomized
controlled pilot trial with 70 youth/caregiver dyads to gather preliminary evidence of the efficacy of FBT 2.0 on
relative weight, behavioral and psychosocial outcomes; (3) finalize and prepare FBT 2.0 for commercialization
using data and feedback from the pilot trial, and feedback from focus groups conducted with stakeholders who
are involved in the treatment of children with obesity (behavioral and medical health providers, clinic and health
system leadership, payers). The resulting FBT 2.0 will transform evidence-based FBT into an effective, engaging,
and scalable intervention for broad dissemination and sustainable public health impact."

In response to NIH PAR-23-308, the Howard-Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Alliance in Cancer Research,
Education and Equity (H2CAREE) initiative aims to advance cancer care and health equity through the
partnership between Howard University (HU) and the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Sidney Kimmel
Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC).
Situated in the vibrant DC, Maryland, and Virginia (DMV) area, the two institutions collectively have a direct
impact on a population of 4 million historically underserved African Americans in the area, with over 2 million
Black residents in the metropolitan of Washington DC and Baltimore. Focused on DMV region, the initiative
strives to address healthcare disparities in this diverse and significant demographic. Howard University and
Johns Hopkins University possess distinctive strengths that complement each other in achieving the proposed
goal through integrated research, research education, and outreach. The primary objectives are to establish
and sustain collaborative cancer research programs with an emphasis on health equity, to boost cancer
research education programs at HU, and to advance cancer care for traditionally underserved
populations through outreach activities.
The H2CAREE initiative comprises of four Cores (Administrative, Outreach, Research Education, and Planning
& Evaluation); two Full Research Projects; one Pilot Research Project; and one Shared Resource Core (Data
Science). With these assets and activities, the Partnership will: 1) through research projects, the shared resource
core, and the research education core, increase cancer research and research education capacity at HU; 2)
through the research projects, improve research programs focusing on cancer health disparity at SKCCC; 3)
through the research project and the research education core, increase the number of investigators and students
conducting cancer health disparities research; 4) through the research education core and outreach core,
promote the diversity of the cancer research workforce by increasing the number of African American students
pursuing cancer research; and 5) through the outreach core, develop and implement cancer outreach and
education initiatives that benefit both locally, i.e. the DMV region, and nationally. Additionally, the Planning and
Evaluation Core will continually assess/evaluate outcomes of the cores, research projects, and shared
resources. Together, the collection of the efforts in H2CAREE will contribute to elimination of cancer health
disparities."
11011199,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Down Syndrome (DS) is considered a disease of premature aging and confers a significant predisposition for
early development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent evidence links senescence and the senescence
associated secretory phenotype (SASP), by which senescence spreads to bystander cells, as mechanisms that
may be a cause or early consequence of AD pathologic changes. The present project is aimed at understanding
the contribution of senescence/SASP to DS using human postmortem tissue and will examine the major cell
types (neurons, astrocytes, and microglia), and synaptic terminals. Cell-specific extracellular vesicles
(EVs)/exosomes will simultaneously be isolated from each brain sample. My laboratory has developed methods
for flow cytometry analysis of brain cells and synaptosomes (resealed nerve terminals) prepared from human
and mouse model tissue that has been cryopreserved. Human cases will include Downs Syndrome cases with
comparison to aged controls and AD cases across disease stage.
Our working hypothesis is that the accelerated aging phenotype that accompanies DS alters senescence/SASP
pathways in ways distinct from mechanisms in typical late-onset AD. We expect in differential effects in different
brain cell types, and hypothesize spread to neighboring cells by exosomes. Aim 1 will determine effects of
senescence/SASP in glia (microglia, astrocytes), and in neurons. Aim 2 is in vitro, and will examine effects of
DS on: a) senescence cargoes in cell-specific EVs/exosomes from human samples b) transfer of the senescence
phenotype in cell lines and co-cultures. Senolytics and other therapies are being considered, and the proposed
experiments in brain cell types and synapses are needed in order to understand mechanisms in human samples
and predict effects of these therapeutics. EV/exosome studies will address crucial gaps in basic science
understanding of EV transfer of phenotypes and pathology, and may serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and
disease progression."

Intimate partner violence (IPV), the physical violence, sexual violence, psychological aggression, or stalking by
a current or former intimate partner, is a significant public health concern affecting approximately 10 million
people in the United States annually. Approximately 33% of women exposed to IPV report physical trauma
resulting in heighted risk of head injury in this population. Recent work suggests that anywhere from 40-90% of
women experience head trauma due to IPV. IPV-related head trauma is caused by blunt force trauma, being
pushed or violently shaken, and/or strangulation, which can result in focal trauma or contusions, acceleration
and deceleration injuries, as well as hypoxia and anoxia due to strangulation, respectively. Limited research
has shown that women exposed to IPV with head trauma report higher depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic
stress disorder symptomatology, as well as impaired cognitive function relative to women with IPV and no
exposure to head trauma. Although the clinical features of repeated exposure to head trauma identified in IPV
are similar to the effects observed in military traumatic brain injury (TBI) and sports-related concussion, limited
work has been done to understand IPV-related head trauma, in particular its chronic cognitive and
psychological effects as well as associated brain changes. Through a multi-site research collaboration
consisting of members of the Enhancing NeuroImaging and Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) IPV
Working Group, the proposed study will characterize the cognitive, psychological, and neural profiles of IPV-
related head trauma, as well as determine whether specific symptoms clusters are associated with discernable
IPV subgroups. Furthermore, this proposal initiates the process of creating an IPV study cohort that will be re-
assessed every 5 years to chronically assess brain and behavioral changes associated with IPV-related head
trauma over the lifespan. Semi-structured interviews will be used to obtain IPV specific information such as
abuse and head trauma history and frequency. A comprehensive neuropsychological battery will be used to
determine cognitive and psychological status, while sophisticated neuroimaging techniques will be used to
characterize neural structure, function, and brain metabolites in IPV with exposure to head trauma relative to
IPV without exposure to head trauma. Finally, we will use a data-driven approach to determine whether
symptom clusters differentiate subgroups of IPV. In aim 1, we will identify the cognitive and psychological
profiles of subgroups of IPV. Aim 2 will examine the neuroimaging signatures in subgroups of IPV. In aim 3, we
will determine whether symptom clusters are associated with discernible subgroups of IPV. The results from
this study will provide critical information about the role of IPV-related head trauma in cognitive and
psychological outcomes, as well as the underlying neural changes. This is important not only for understanding
the chronic effects of repetitive brain trauma, but also the identification of distinct subgroups of IPV has direct
implications for development of patient-centered care approaches for IPV."
11013184,"Aphasia is a language disorder commonly caused by stroke and other acquired brain injuries that affects over
two million people in the US and has a large negative effect on quality of life. Anomia (i.e., word-finding
difficulty) is a primary frustration for people with aphasia, and naming treatments for anomia are both widely
researched and commonly used in clinical practice. For naming treatments to make a meaningful impact on the
lives of people with aphasia, they must produce durable gains in word-finding which generalize beyond the
treatment context. However, most theoretically-motivated naming treatment research fails to address the long-
term retention of trained words and their generalization to connected speech, limiting their clinical impact.
 Prevailing learning theory suggests that “desirable difficulty” improves treatment retention and
generalization. The current proposal therefore seeks to improve the durability and context generalization of
computer-based naming treatment by incorporating model-based algorithms to adaptively maintain desirable
difficulty. We will test two distinct models in parallel clinical trials. Our central premise is that these models will
facilitate a balance between what have historically been framed as contrasting learning approaches: errorless
learning vs. effortful retrieval (Study 1) and massed vs. distributed practice (Study 2). Instead, our models will
integrate these approaches by replacing extreme static contrasts with continuous task components which can
be adaptively modified based on ongoing patient performance. Study 1 will adaptively balance effort and
accuracy using speeded naming deadlines based on a model we have developed which characterizes
individuals’ speed-accuracy tradeoffs in picture naming over time. Study 2 will manipulate trial spacing using
an adaptive scheduling and memory decay model built into widely available, open-source flashcard software.
 In both studies, we predict that when compared to matched traditional non-adaptive treatment
conditions, our adaptive conditions will produce more successful retention of trained words 3 and 6 months
post-treatment on naming probes (Aims 1a, 2a), and better context generalization to connected speech when
tested on complex scene descriptions containing untrained exemplars of trained words (Aims 1b, 2b). We also
predict that adaptive trial spacing in Study 2 will successfully train many more words than is possible in current
standard care. In addition, data generated in Studies 1 and 2 will be used to develop the next generation of
adaptive timing models (Aims 1c and 2c), spurring future innovations in personalized medicine.
Successful clinical trial outcomes will demonstrate that adaptive computer-based naming treatments provide a
novel way to produce large, durable, and generalizable treatment gains, and positive Study 2 findings could be
immediately implemented in clinical practice at scale using free open-source software. Successful modeling
outcomes will lead to even more effective interventions and lay the groundwork for a transformative research
agenda that could ultimately lead to comprehensive adaptive learning systems for aphasia rehabilitation."
11013199,"U44 NS125160 - Abstract:
Cardiac arrest in infants is a medical emergency requiring rapid resuscitation to restore circulation. However,
resuscitation often results in significant brain injury, caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Only 36% of infants
(<1yr old) treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and 69% of infants that suffer in-hospital cardiac arrest are
successfully resuscitated. These infants currently have no therapeutic options to limit brain injury. The current
standard treatment for post-cardiac arrest brain injury is therapeutic hypothermia. Unfortunately, recent
studies demonstrated that use of therapeutic hypothermia in pediatric cardiac arrest patients does not provide
significant benefit beyond what is achieved with controlled normothermia. A safe and effective neuroprotective
intervention that specifically targets reperfusion injury would fill a critical unmet need in the treatment of these
vulnerable patients.
Our molecular studies on mitochondria uncovered a novel method to non-invasively modulate mitochondrial
function during reperfusion and reduce brain injury following resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Indeed, our
studies have, for the first time: (i) identified two wavelengths of near infrared light (NIR) that specifically and
reversibly reduce mitochondrial respiration by acting on cytochrome c oxidase (COX); (ii) documented that
NIR, applied at the time of reoxygenation, is neuroprotective in rodent and swine models of infant and pediatric
cardiac arrest/resuscitation; and (iii) developed a NIR-delivery system capable of providing therapeutic doses
to patients up to 1 year old. Based on these data, we propose to produce the clinical Light Utilizing COX-
Inhibitory Device (LUCID), a medical device that will safely deliver therapeutic NIR to the infant brain. To
achieve this goal, Phase I will focus on device development and validation of LUCID in 3 experimental aims:
• Develop LUCID engineered for clinical use (Aim 1).
• Evaluate safety and efficacy of LUCID (Aim 2).
• LUCID clinical trial development and HUD and IDE approval (Aim 3).
Phase II will utilize the LUCID clinical device and execute the “LUCID Therapy for Infant Cardiac Arrest”
(LUTICA) clinical trial (Aim 4).
This proposal combines multi-disciplinary expertise, compelling preliminary data, and state-of-the-art
resources available to our team to address a significant health problem in a highly vulnerable patient
population."

Additionally, the MPI from Drexel University has moved to Dartmouth College, also expanding
administrative and sIRB costs requiring increased efforts for Dr. Belle and a project coordinator. Dr.
Jakicic, a co-Investigator, became the primary developer of the intervention and continues work with
the interventionists to monitor intervention delivery so, as a result, he spends greater than anticipated

11020076,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Population health statistics paint a sobering portrait of U.S. women’s health, particularly among
women from NIH-designated health disparity or understudied, underrepresented, and underreported
(U3) populations. The broad scope and unequal patterning of U.S. women’s health disadvantage
underscores the need for interdisciplinary research into related trends and trajectories, causes, and
consequences. In particular, as recognized in reports by the NIH and other scientific bodies,
population science on women’s health must consider a wide range of social and structural
determinants as well as the contributions of healthcare, medicine, and biology, requiring
interdisciplinary training and collaboration. To respond to this need, the Population Studies and
Training Center (PSTC) at Brown University requests supplemental funding to support the
development of research on women’s health among women from U3 populations under its Population
Dynamics Centers Research Infrastructure Program grant (P2CHD041020-23). This request is in
response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Research on the Health of Women of
Understudied, Underrepresented and Underreported (U3) Populations (NOT-OD-24-032). With this
supplement, PSTC will establish the Initiative in Women’s Health Equity to bring together scholars
from the social sciences, public health, and medicine at Brown with the overarching goal of building
interdisciplinary teams with diverse expertise to advance population science in this area. Expanding
the PSTC research portfolio to include research on women’s health that specifically focuses on
women from NIH-designated health disparity or understudied, underrepresented, and underreported
(U3) populations in biomedical research will enhance and expand science in PSTC’s Primary
Research Areas of Migration and Urbanization; Children, Families, and Health; Reproductive Health
and HIV/AIDS; Population, Development, and Environment; and Social Foundations of Health
Disparities. Applying PSTC expertise on the social and structural contexts that produce inequality,
and diminish health and well-being for marginalized populations, to research on women’s health, will
contribute to ORWH efforts to build interdisciplinary research focused on the effect of sex and gender
at the intersection of the social determinants of health and disease."

 2 Despite improvements in median life expectancy for sickle cell disease (SCD) from 14 years in
 3 1973 to 61 years in recent cohorts from academic centers, adults with SCD experience
 4 functional impairments. They develop deficits in physical, social, and cognitive function due to
 5 both age-related changes and SCD complications, such as avascular necrosis, strokes,
 6 cardiopulmonary disease, and sensory deficits. There are no validated assessment tools or
 7 interventions to improve physical function in older adults with SCD. Failure to recognize and
 8 manage vulnerabilities and functional decline can lead to disability and premature death. In a
 9 pilot study we evaluated the feasibility if the Sickle Cell Disease Functional Assessment (SCD-
10 FA) and demonstrated that it was feasible, acceptable, and safe. In this study, we will evaluate
11 the validity and reliability of the SCD-FA in a prospective cohort of older adults with SCD (age ≥
12 40 years) (Aim 1). We will evaluate the utility of the SCD-FA to predict number of days
13 hospitalized per year as the primary outcome, and Sickle Cell Day Hospital visits, emergency
14 department visits, dependence in Activities of Daily Living, and death as secondary outcomes.
15 We will also determine risk factors for impaired physical performance (Aim 2). The SCD-FA will
16 provide a method for: 1) assessing vulnerabilities in multiple health domains, 2) identifying
17 targets for interventions, and 3) measuring change in function. To address functional
18 impairments, we will adapt and pilot a personalized exercise training program in older adults
19 (age ≥ 40 years) with SCD (Aim 3). The intervention will be a virtual program adapted from
20 Gerofit, which is a supervised exercise and health promotion program for older adults that
21 includes exercises customized to each person’s health status and underlying functional deficits.
22 The expected outcome is to have pilot data to design a randomized control trial of a
23 personalized exercise intervention for older adults with SCD.

11021364,"Project Summary/Abstract: Adolescent alcohol use is a known risk factor for the development
of alcohol use disorders (AUDs); latent maladaptive plasticity associated with adolescent use
likely underlies this increased risk in adults. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is a
sexually dimorphic brain region and critically involved in stress and negative affect-associated
relapse in AUDs, and therefore is a prime target for this maladaptive plasticity. Using a model of
adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) in male and female mice, we find disrupted
BNST glutamatergic transmission and plasticity, but the mechanisms differ across sex (GluN2B-
NMDAR-mediated in males and mGluR1/5-mediated in females). When tested during
adulthood, both forms of BNST plasticity return to control levels but exposure to restraint stress
produced a re-emergence of AIE-induced that were sex-specific. AIE also increased glutamate
release in the BNST and this effect appears be mitigated through modulation of presynaptic
CRFR1. AIE and adult stress also produce sex-specific negative affect behavioral phenotypes
(novelty-induced hypophagia test in females, foot shock-induce freezing in males). As the BNST
sits at the intersection between cortical inputs and downstream amygdalar and hypothalamic
targets, this enhanced drive to the BNST and subsequent inter BNST plasticity likely sensitize
the stress response and the expression of negative affect behaviors. Using a combination of
molecular, electrophysiological, genetic, and behavioral approaches, we will evaluate the ability
of AIE to prime the BNST to adult stress sex-specific manner. I hypothesize that that AIE and
adult stress act to synergistically enhance glutamate release in the BNST via activation of
CRFR1 in male mice but not female mice (Aim 1). Modulation of CRFR1 transmission will be
examined for its ability to block the effects of stress on glutamate release and plasticity and
evaluate stress sensitive inputs. Next, I propose that the sex difference in BNST plasticity occur
in distinct projection regions (CeA, LH, or VTA). Finally, BNST-specific deletion, BNST
DREADD activation, and pharmacological antagonism of GluN2B-NMDARs and mGluR5s
(depending on the sex) will be used to assess the role of these receptors in the development of
sex-specific negative affect phenotypes. The goal of this work is to identify potential
pharmacotherapies to treat AUDs and our work suggest that these likely need to be distinct for
males and females."

 This is for an administrative supplement for a K08 award for Dr. Shah Ali, MD, an Assistant Professor in
Cardiology at the Columbia University Medical Center. He has completed residency training in Internal Medicine
at the University of California San Francisco and fellowship training in Cardiology at UTSW.
 The research in this proposal will be conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Steven Marx, a leading expert in
the field of cardiomyocyte and ion channel biology and an ideal mentor with significant training experience. In
addition, an Advisory Committee composed of Columbia-based mentors as well as Dr. Hesham Sadek will
provide biannual constructive criticism of data, hypotheses, and proposed experiments in a written manner as
well as career guidance and development.
 The proposal described herein will investigate the molecular mechanisms of neonatal heart regeneration
in mice with an aim at translating these findings to humans to generate novel therapies to treat heart diseases.
Although the mammalian heart is known to be a mostly quiescent organ whose primary parenchymal cell – the
cardiomyocyte – is cell cycle-arrested in adults, recent pioneering studies from the laboratory of Dr. Sadek have
characterized a phenomenon of complete cardiac regeneration in neonatal mice. After resection of the ventricular
apex or surgically-induced myocardial infarction (MI), mice younger than one week of age exhibit complete
cardiomyocyte renewal, in stark contrast to adult mice that develop a fibrotic scar due to failure to achieve
meaningful cardiomyogenesis. A fate-mapping approach showed that existing cardiomyocytes divide to generate
new cardiomyocytes after neonatal injuries.
 Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that there are cardiotropic factors within the young mouse
heart that elicit the robust cardiomyocyte proliferation after neonatal MI. Our preliminary data identifies insulin-
like growth factor binding protein, IGFBP3, as a cardiomyocyte mitogen that enables cardiomyocyte division.
Intriguingly, this factor is not expressed in the heart in the absence of injury or during development, suggesting
that it is part of a specific injury-induced signaling pathway. The specific aims propose to: 1) identify and
characterize the cell that secretes IGFBP3 in response to injury, 2) determine whether IGFBP3 is necessary for
neonatal regeneration and/or sufficient to promote cardiomyocyte renewal after adult MI, and 3) determine
whether IGFBP3 utilizes IGF signaling to stimulate cardiomyocyte division.
 Ultimately, the training and research plan outlined here will support Dr. Ali as he achieves independence
as a physician-scientist-cardiologist. As an independent PI, Dr. Ali will study the mechanisms that mediate
neonatal heart regeneration to inform the development of novel therapeutics for adult heart disease, a logical
extension of his K08 proposal."

An estimated 12 million adolescent girls marry before the age of 18 annually, the majority of whom live in
resource-constrained environments in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Northern Nigeria is a striking
example, with 78% of girls married before the age of 18, and 48% before the age of 15. Child marriage
worsens not only health outcomes, including early fertility, maternal morbidity and mortality, depression, and
sexually transmitted infections, but also important social determinants of health like education, social support,
and intimate partner violence. The complex and contextual determinants of child marriage mean that
successful interventions are rare, and causal evidence on the effects of delaying child marriage remains
limited, with many programs to delay child marriage focusing on a single, limited margin of intervention. A
previous cluster-randomized control trial of the Pathways intervention in northern Nigeria led to unusually large
reductions in child marriage two years post intervention by combining social, educational, and vocational
support with community-based recruitment. By generating a novel dataset from follow up surveys with the
original study participants six years after implementation, we propose not only to evaluate the effectiveness of
the Pathways program, but also to leverage this unusually successful program to generate rigorous causal
evidence on the effects of delaying child marriage. We will generate causal evidence on the intervention's
effectiveness on marital, health and related outcomes, and use cost-benefit analysis to translate the results to
policy-relevant figures, contributing to the global knowledge base on preventing child marriage and
simultaneously informing the design of future interventions."

Interdisciplinary researchers at Emory University propose to plan and execute a program on Advanced
Research Training in SDOH (ART). The primary goals are to increase the number of nurse scientists, and
scientists in aligned fields prepared to conduct research on the powerful ways that SDOH influences the health
of individuals, families, and communities and to increase the numbers of investigators that are poised to
conduct research in alignment with NINR’s strategic plan. The program builds on an outstanding research
infrastructure focused on SDOH and will be a logical and powerful extension of a four-year initiative launched
in the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing to thoroughly integrate SDOH knowledge throughout our
curriculum. The ART program in SDOH will provide early-career faculty a mentored, educational program to
foster their transition to independent investigators with advanced skills in research methods relevant to SDOH.
ART will also provide mid-career faculty a training opportunity to integrate SDOH into their established
programs of research and to emerge as scientific leaders in SDOH. Trainees will be chosen who have interest
and alignment with our research strengths in SDOH including cancer, cardiovascular disease, aging and
cognition, climate change and behavioral health. In addition, our Center for Data Science and our Office for
Nursing Research provides a rich milieu to expose trainees to new methodologies being developed to capture
the impact of SDOH. The ART program consists of developing and implementing a Short Course in Research
Methods Related to SDOH content that will incorporate fundamentals of conceptual models; review of current
evidence related to SDOH topics and the impacts of this evidence on health disparities and health inequities;
relevant research methods critical to knowledge gaps in SDOH; and guidance on the development and
maintenance of successful transdisciplinary research collaborations. Trainees will be provided hands-on
research training by NIH-funded faculty at Emory University Schools of Nursing and Public Health on SDOH
related research topics. The program is envisioned to establish the basis of a long-term mentorship program
with our faculty in which trainees will be supported in continued development in obtaining NIH R-level research
funding relevant to SDOH. Moreover, the nurse scientists and those in related fields will be trained to be
ethically and critically engaged in SDOH research. They will emerge as trailblazers in SDOH research,
champions of multi-dimensional preventive strategies, and experts in advanced research methodologies,
setting new paradigms in nursing and related sciences."

11020105,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
eSwatini has the world’s highest prevalence of HIV, with more than one in four adults currently living with HIV.
Extraordinary efforts at reducing the burden of HIV/AIDS have led eSwatini to become the first African country
to surpass the UNAIDS “95-95-95” goals of diagnosing ≥95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV), providing
treatment to ≥95% of those diagnosed, and achieving viral load suppression in ≥95% of those on treatment,
leading to dramatic reductions in HIV mortality. In contrast, deaths from many non-communicable diseases
(NCDs) in eSwatini are increasing. Deaths from cardiovascular disease, the second-leading cause of death
after HIV/AIDS in eSwatini, have risen by 11% since 2000. Deaths from cancer, diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, self-harm, and violence have increased by 12-35% over the same time period. Accordingly, the
eSwatini Ministry of Health (MoH) is keenly interested in leveraging HIV care systems to improve care and
prevention for cardiovascular disease and other high-burden NCDs. Due to resource constraints, not all NCD
care can be provided to all residents of eSwatini, but a health benefits package (HBP) could be created to
deliver the greatest possible health benefits within the limits of the country’s health budget and cadre of
healthcare personnel. Additionally, like many other countries, eSwatini faces a growing risk of pandemics,
conflict, and natural disasters due to population growth and climate change. These events can cause
exogenous shocks that interrupt routine healthcare delivery, which may have implications for prioritizing which
health services to offer. For example, investments in primary prevention may become a more efficient option
than continuously delivering treatment for diseases when taking into consideration the likelihood of exogenous
shocks to the healthcare system over coming decades. Our team combines expertise in modeling, health
economics, HIV/NCD care integration, and eSwatini’s health system – including the current Director of
Planning for the eSwatini Ministry of Health. Our study will (Aim 1) determine which non-HIV health services
will be efficient to co-deliver with HIV care given the evolving demographics and health risks among people
living with HIV in eSwatini, (Aim 2) determine which services to include in eSwatini’s HBP to maximize
population health under resource constraints, and (Aim 3) assess trade-offs between health system efficiency
and resilience to exogenous shocks such as pandemics, conflict, and natural disasters. Additionally, eSwatini
is likely to be a forerunner of health policy questions to arise elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, where other
countries are working to surpass the “95-95-95” treatment goals in coming years. Accordingly, we will
disseminate results in the Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa Health Community to amplify the impact of
our research and set the stage for future work."

Oral and long acting injectable (LAI) pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), an effective evidence-based HIV
prevention intervention, is underutilized among Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men
(LMSM) in the US. Nationally, only 21% of PrEP-eligible Latina/o/x individuals (mostly LMSM) were on PrEP,
while representing 30% of all new HIV diagnoses among MSM. In Georgia (GA), while HIV diagnoses have
decreased overall, new HIV diagnoses among Latino men (80% MSM) increased by 13% between 2010-2019.
Our group identified a scarcity of PrEP clinics able to provide culturally concordant PrEP care to LMSM in
Atlanta. In addition, despite LAI PrEP’s superior efficacy compared to oral PrEP, its implementation in
Southern states without Medicaid expansion (such as GA) has been difficult. Federally Qualified Health
Centers (FQHCs) are the ideal setting to implement culturally tailored strategies to increase oral and LAI PrEP
uptake among LMSM, but there is a technical capacity gap to address PrEP-, MSM-, and Latino-specific
needs. To address this gap, through direct partnership with two local community-based organizations and
health departments, the objective of the proposed implementation science research project is to develop and
pilot IntégraTE, an implementation strategy to increase oral and LAI PrEP accessibility and quality of care for
LMSM in 3 FQHCs in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. We will first conduct an explanatory qualitative
assessment at 3 FQHCs through focus group discussions (FGD) to identify major barriers and facilitators of
providing oral and LAI PrEP services for LMSM. Through these findings and leveraging co-mentors
Sheth/Sales prior work, we will develop the IntégraTE strategy, an LMSM-tailored set of oral and LAI PrEP
trainings and technical assistance for 3 FQHCs. Lastly, in a pre/post implementation mixed methods study
design, we will assess the strategy’s reach, acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, implementation,
timeliness, satisfaction, and cultural competence, through surveys to 50 clinic personnel and 60 LMSM, FGDs
among clinic personnel, electronical health record chart abstraction, and direct observations of day-to-day
clinic activities. Our community-academia-public health partnership is ideally suited to carry out the proposed
study, as we have demonstrated ability to recruit 44 LMSM during the SaludFindr study and 70 LMSM for the
CREEMOS study, with both studies reaching 80% retention. In line with the Minority HIV Research Initiative
(MARI) objectives and the End the HIV Epidemic Prevent pillar, this research will support the development of
the first implementation strategy seeking to improve PrEP accessibility for LMSM in the Atlanta area at the
service provision level. Results from this study will serve as preliminary data to prepare a NIH R01 application
to conduct a hybrid type-2 effectiveness implementation study to 1) identify factors associated with clinic-level
adoption and implementation of the IntégraTE strategy at representative FQHCs across metro Atlanta, and 2)
evaluate the effectiveness and maintenance of IntégraTE on PrEP initiation and persistence among LMSM."

Decades of global effort have yet to result in a robust and effective preventative vaccine for HIV, although it has
yielded remarkable insights into the likely requirements for immunogen design and potential correlates of vaccine
mediate protection. The encouraging results of RV144 unfortunately were not reproduced in its adaptation to
South Africa with HVTN 702, however both have demonstrated that a finely tuned antibody (Ab) response to
gp120, particularly V1V2 will likely be key to an effective vaccine. Similarly, the VRC01 efficacy trial established
the defining threshold for a gp120 CD4 binding site broadly neutralizing Ab to mediate protection, and numerous
highly engineered gp120-based immunogens in clinical trials attempting to induce precise germline and B cell
receptor development pathways, demonstrate the necessity of clearly defining gp120 specific B cell memory
development. Development of a protective Ab response to HIV is likely dependent on the characteristics of the
pre-existing B cell population present prior to HIV infection or vaccination, referred to as pre-immune B cells. We
and others have demonstrated increased HIV-specific plasma Abs in individuals at high-risk for HIV acquisition
(HR) and recently we have demonstrated that HIV gp120-specific pre-immune B cells include as expected naïve
B cells, but also a substantial non-naïve proportion consisting of IgA, IgG, and IgM memory B cells. Following
HIV Env vaccination, both pre-immune B cell populations respond and undergo somatic hypermutation and
affinity maturation to give rise to high affinity HIV Env-specific Abs. Although the composition of the naïve pre-
immune HIV Env-specific repertoire is driven by germline genetics and likely to be highly similar amongst
individuals, the composition of non-naïve pre-immune HIV Env-specific repertoire is likely to be more
heterogenous. Its composition is likely driven by exposure to cross-reactive antigens such as microflora and
potentially in the instance of HR, bystander B cell activation resulting from other sexually transmitted infections,
and unproductive exposures to HIV such as with individuals with on PrEP, and subsequently more heterogenous
than the naïve pre-immune compartment. Such heterogeneity and memory bias of the pre-immune repertoire,
similar to the consequences of imprinting observed with responses to other viruses (e.g. influenza, dengue),
could result in inconsistent HIV vaccine efficacy among HR. We hypothesize that the composition and
responsiveness of the gp120 pre-immune B cell compartment is altered in HR and contributes to inconsistent
vaccine responses. To address this hypothesis, we will leverage existing longitudinal samples from US-based
HR that are or are not using PrEP and control individuals at low-risk for HIV acquisition (LR) obtained through
the NIH-funded MWCCS, a prospective Chlamydia trachomatis infection cohort, and South Africa-based HR and
LR that participated in the HVTN 702 vaccine efficacy trial to complete the following aims 1) determine the
molecular and phenotypic features of pre-immune gp120+ B cells, 2) define the mobilization of pre-immune
gp120+ B cells following vaccination, and 3) identify drivers of pre-immune gp120+ memory B cell development."
10778524,"The long-term objective of this grant is to investigate how airway exposure to natural allergens leads to
 development of type 2 immunity and allergic diseases. Exaggerated type 2 immune responses are implicated in
 a wide variety of disorders ranging from asthma to food allergy. Traditionally, CD4+ type 2 helper T (Th2) cells
 that produce interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 have been considered major players in directing the
 pathophysiology of these diseases, such as airway eosinophilia and IgE antibody production. During the previous
 funding period of this MERIT Award, we have made major progress in all three Aims. We found that allergen-
 specific T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and tissue-resident memory (Trm) cells play distinct roles in allergic immune
 responses. Specifically, Tfh cells promoted production of allergen-specific IgE antibodies and development of
 acute anaphylaxis while Th2-type Trm cells likely play a role in allergen-induce type 2 cytokine production and
 eosinophilic inflammation in mucosal tissues. Here we request a 5-year extension of the MERIT Award to
 continue studying the immunologic mechanism of type 2 immunity. We will finalize and submit at least 4
 manuscripts that are described in the progress report. We will extend the studies of the previous funding period
 and define how allergen exposure mediates various immunologic and clinical phenotypes of allergic diseases. In
 Aim 1, we will examine the the roles of Th2-type Trm cells in mediating type 2 cytokine production and
 eosinophilic inflammation in airway mucosa. We will leverage mouse models and use parabiosis and
 immunologic and genetic approaches to critically define the functions of Trm cells and their regulatory
 mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will examine how lung T resident helper (Trh) cells mediate IgE antibody production
 and inflammation in mucosal tissues. Our preliminarily data show the presence of CD4+PD-1+FR4+ Trh cells, a
 new subset of Tfh-like cells, in the lungs of mice exposed to allergens. We will use mouse genetic approaches to
 characterize this new cell type and understand its roles in type 2 immunity. In Aim 3, we continue collaborating
 with Dr. Shiv Kale, and ask a fundamental question why certain allergens robustly induce type 2 immunity. We
 will take a fungal functional genomic approach and study the roles of - galactosidases produced by fungus
 Alternaria. Together, the studies in these aims will define the central mechanisms underlying the development
 and regulation of type 2 immunity to airborne allergens and will provide an immunologic explanation regarding
 various clinical phenotypes of allergic diseases. Ultimately, these studies will characterize key cellular pathway(s)
 and molecule(s) involved in allergic immune responses, allowing identification of critical targets for development
 of novel therapeutic strategies to treat or to prevent asthma and allergic diseases."
10810854,"The long-term goal of the Shlomchik lab is to understand the role of TLRs in SLE. Prior work by us and others
revealed that, surprisingly, disease was markedly exacerbated in the absence of TLR9, even though TLR9
was required for anti-DNA and anti-chromatin autoantibody production. The opposite roles for these two
similar TLRs is likely a fundamental feature of TLR biology and of SLE, yet it is poorly understood. Given the
large number of SLE risk alleles that map to the TLR signaling pathway, we will elucidate this fundamental
biology and how it applies to disease mechanisms and therapy. Experiments proposed in the original
application and which will be continued during the MERIT extension will directly address how TLR7 and TLR9
have divergent roles, how they cross-regulate each other, and how this promotes and regulates disease. Our
lab has pioneered genetic in vivo methods for the study of lupus mechanism in animal models, in part leading
to the recognition of the roles of TLR7 and TLR9, in studies supported in the prior period of this PPG. We
have created novel models and used genetic approaches in order to dissect the cells and molecular signaling
pathways required to promote disease in vivo. In the first three years we have made and analyzed multiple
novel models, which have already greatly informed our insights into how TLR7 and 9 function differently and
control lupus. Additional models are needed, and the mice we have recently made will require substantial in
depth analysis; we must wait 6 months for age-dependent lupus to evolve in these mice. In addition to in vivo
studies, we are now on the verge of determining biochemical and signaling properties of the mutants, which
will provide very novel insights into TLR7 and 9 biology. Our mutant mice allow us to study this in primary B
cells, which our data from Aim 1 shows us are the key cell type. In Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that
tissue-specific expression of TLR7 and TLR9 explains some or all of their divergent phenotypes. We will use
our new TLR7 floxed mice to examine tissue-specific TLR7 expression to both macrophages and neutrophils
given our recent results that TLR7 expression in B cells is not the whole story. We will also now extend our
studies to TLR8. In Aim 2 we will address the hypothesis that TLR9 regulates TLR7 signals in a cell intrinsic
way. To test this, we are making a series of mutant mice, whose phenotypes need to be determined together
in order to determine how TLR7 and 9 differ and how they cross-regulate. We propose new imaging,
biochemical and cell biological experiments that will illuminate how TR7 vs TLR9 function in primary B cells.
Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the therapeutic potential of TLR inhibition using an inducible Cre to overexpress
TLR9. Last, we will test TLR9 agonists to determine if TLR9 can be used therapeutically to treat disease."
10819211,"SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL
Modern antiretroviral therapies have transformed Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection into a 
chronically manageable disease. However, a significant amount of people with HIV on antiretroviral therapies 
present with a spectrum of neurological symptoms. These HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) 
remain an important aspect of modern HIV pathology, prognosis, and clinical management, raising the need 
for the discovery of adjuvant therapies. Clinical evidence also suggests that HAND can be aggravated by 
substance abuse, including opioids, which is highly prevalent in people with HIV. Understanding how opioid 
use contributes to cognitive impairment in HAND will help identify new approaches and drug targets to treat 
HAND in opioid users.
For the past two decades, we have investigated how HIV neurotoxins and opioids contribute to HAND by 
regulating the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in the central nervous system. We have demonstrated that proper 
CXCR4 signaling via its natural ligand (the chemokine CXCL12) is not only neuroprotective, but it can also 
rescue structural (i.e. dendritic spines loss) and functional (i.e. cognitive flexibility) deficits in an animal model 
of HAND. Further, we discovered that this pathway is hijacked by viral proteins and inhibited by µ-opioid 
receptor agonists, which revealed a new mechanism whereby opioid use can aggravate HAND. Overall, our 
body of work demonstrates that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is tightly integrated into homeostatic and plasticity 
processes in cortical neurons, and disruption of CXCR4 signaling via HIV proteins, inflammatory mediators, 
and opioids is an important component of HAND.
For the next (and last) period of this award, we plan 
to capitalize on this knowledge and other recent 
findings and fill key gaps in the field that will help us 
assess the therapeutic value of these discoveries. 
Thanks to new collaborations, we shifted our focus 
from molecular mechanisms to network level 
function – with a main interest in the role of cortical 
interneurons in HAND. Notably, cortical 
interneurons dysfunction has emerged as a key 
factor in neuropsychiatric conditions linked to 
substance use disorders.
Our objectives for the next five years are to determine how interneurons contribute to CXCL12’s regulation of 
neuronal network activity and cognition in models of HAND, and if the chemokine’s effects are inhibited by 
morphine via local circuit modulation. Studies in Aim 1 will examine synaptic plasticity deficits that are 
indicative of microcircuit dysfunction in the medial PFC of WT and HIV-tg rats, and if these network-level 
deficits are reversed by CXCL12 treatment. Aim 2 studies will examine how dendritic-targeting cortical 
interneurons that express CXCR4 (namely, SST+ inhibitory neurons) modulate the activity of local networks 
to enhance neuronal connectivity, and how these processes are affected by inhibitory neurons that express 
µ-opioid receptors. In Aim 3, we will examine CXCL12/morphine effects in the human brain as a premise to 
development of new network-based treatments for HAND. 
As this project aims to understand CXCR4 action at the system level, we will utilize experimental methods 
that most recapitulate the natural environment of neuronal networks. These include cortical organotypic 
cultures, where the three-dimensional architecture of the tissue is preserved and in vivo studies to measure 
cognitive flexibility, coupled to ex vivo analyses, as described in detail in the attached proposal.
Based on unexpected new findings concerning CXCR4 expression in mature individual neurons, we 
hypothesize that CXCL12 action relies on microcircuit mechanisms that regulates both synaptic plasticity and 
cognition. Our working hypothesis is that CXCL12 signaling primes CXCR4+ somatostatin expressing 
interneurons in microcircuits to optimally respond to different stimuli and improves network connectivity. 
Conversely, morphine acts on larger contingent of interneurons, including CXCR4+ interneurons, ultimately 
causing local networks to scale back synaptic connections. 
This project will reveal the role of cortical interneurons in cognitive deficits in HAND and test new concepts in 
the chemokine/opioid relationship (i.e. not limited to cell autonomous mechanisms) that have a broad range 
of consequences for substance use disorders."
11013554,"SUMMARY
In the US, 48 million surgeries are performed annually. Despite medical and surgical advancements,
postoperative complications are the third leading cause of death. Perioperative risk varies between patients
based on their health and surgical procedure(s). Patients with intermediate or high perioperative risk experience
extended hospital stays, higher readmission rates, and frequent adverse events, including death. Many higher
risk patients have modifiable risk factors. The healthcare industry is prioritizing the advancement of perioperative
care to reduce postoperative complications and improve patient outcomes by modifying risk factors through
medical optimization and prehabilitation. However, patients can find the perioperative journey complex and
impersonal. Patients often don’t have access to a tailored preparation plan and personal guidance, emotional
support, and motivation, despite clinical teams providing a high level of perioperative care detail. Furthermore,
perioperative guidance can be fragmented and confusing with information coming from multiple sources and
unclear tasks. Therefore, there is an unmet need to provide patients with comprehensive perioperative care
guidance and support with a more personalized, enhanced human touch to reduce postoperative complications.
Pip Care is developing a personalized, interactive surgical journey platform – complete with a live health coach
– to optimize the perioperative care process. Our platform, Pip, works seamlessly with any electronic medical
record, thus making it easier and more efficient for care providers to support patients. Additionally, via our
platform, a health coach completes a health intake to create a personalized perioperative care plan, meets
regularly with the patient to encourage goal accomplishment, and facilitates care coordination. Pip empowers
patients to participate in the preoperative optimization goals by breaking down a patient's healthcare plan into
definable, easy-to-understand, and easy-to-complete tasks, and a Health Coach helps to keep the patient on
track to achieve these goals through education and motivation.
In this Fast-Track STTR, our goal is to expand the Pip platform and evaluate the platform among surgical patients
undergoing a variety of surgeries. We propose to (1) develop new clinical pathway modules for additional clinical
comorbidities, surgery types, and coordination of care; (2) assess feasibility, usability acceptability, and
appropriateness; (3) conduct a clinical study and assess our platform’s effects on patient clinical outcomes; and
(4) assess patient-centered outcomes related to the Pip digital health platform and health coaches.
Successful completion of this proposed project will be a major step in advancing the development of our platform
for perioperative care management, ultimately improving patient outcomes and lowering healthcare costs."

11022029,"PROJECT SUMMARY FROM PARENT GRANT
Black Emerging Adults (BEA), ages 18-24, in the U.S. experience higher levels of poverty, illness, and
discrimination than White youth. These exposures to harm, coupled with the lack of supportive services to
address and mitigate poverty and structural inequities, result in health inequities. BEA experience high mental
health service needs, but much less service utilization than White youth, have higher rates of STI and less
access to family planning. Disrupting the social determinants of poverty that systematically affects BEA, can
have a transformative impact on a healthy transition into adulthood during a critical time in their development.
Guaranteed basic income (GBI) is an economic strategy that could redress financial inequities and transform
the mental and physical health outcomes of BEA, which has shown tremendous promise in adults populations
and youth in families receiving income, but little is known about how GBI program would work when cash is
transferred unconditionally and directly to Black emerging adults and what critical supports would be needed to
ensure GBI is most effective. We propose a randomized controlled crossover trial in which 300 low-income
BEA are allocated to receive a $500/month GBI either during the first twelve months of follow-up (phase I) or to
receive GBI in the second 12 months of a total of 24 months follow-up (phase II). All participants, regardless of
randomization arm, will be offered enrollment in financial capability programs -- peer learning circles and
financial coaching -- to bolster GBI effectiveness. Participants will also receive a cell phone-based real-time
monitoring and response intervention (RTMR), which will ensure that BEA with unmet health service needs
receive referrals. The RTMR system will simultaneously provide critical, time-sensitive information for
community agencies and policy makers to address documented service gaps. All components will be co-
designed and monitored by our Community Working Group, comprised of representatives from an extensive
network of partnering community agencies, city officials, and youth who have been active in the financial
capability space. Together these intervention components support BEA on the individual-level (GBI, coaching,
RTMR), interpersonal-level (peer learning circles), community-level (GBI & RTMR), and at the societal level
(policy impacts of GBI, RTMR). We will determine the impacts of GBI and GBI+multi-level supports on BEA’s
investment in their future (education, employment training), mental health (depressive symptoms and anxiety),
and unmet mental health and sexual/reproductive health service needs. We will also include a nested
qualitative component to explore mechanisms of impact on financial, mental and physical health. This study
leverages a strong multi-disciplinary community and research partnership; multilevel intervention components
that address the most urgent inequities that impact the trajectory of BEA during their transition to adulthood
and independence; and provides urgent experimental data with findings that could inform service provision and
policy to advance health equity."

The parent award supports an innovative, rigorous, and widely-recognized training program in population
sciences in the Center for Demography and Ecology (CDE) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The CDE
population sciences training program has maintained nearly continuous NICHD T32 funding since 1975. Our
graduates are among the leaders in population research today, serving in a range of academic, government
and applied research settings. Guided by the NICHD mission “to ensure the health, productivity, independence,
and well-being of all people,” CDE research is organized around five major areas: 1) Families and Family
Change; 2) Inequality, Poverty, Wealth, and Mobility; 3) Health and Biodemography; 4) Spatial and
Environmental Demography, and 5) Gender and Reproductive Health. Our training objectives—and associated
research activities—fall squarely under the Population Dynamics Branch which “supports research, data
collection, and research training in demography, reproductive health, and population health.”
 The primary goals of the CDE training program in demography are: (1) to foster an interdisciplinary
community of junior scholars in population research; (2) to build expertise in demographic theory, methods,
and analysis; and (3) to cultivate students’ professional skills, including the organization, execution,
presentation, publication, and critique of research. CDE training involves four essential components: (1) formal
training via coursework in students’ home departments and interdisciplinary coursework in other departments;
(2) exposure to cutting-edge research in the broader population studies community; (3) collaboration in
substantive research projects of CDE training faculty through an apprenticeship model; and (4) professional
socialization and integration into the field of population studies. Predoctoral T32 trainees are appointed in year
2 or 3 of their PhD program, having shown clear academic promise and a strong commitment to pursuing a
population research career. Trainees typically receive T32 funding for two to three years.
 This supplement requests three years of traineeship funding for an outstanding PhD student in
Economics, Zohal Barsi, who is a scholar of U.S. poverty and its effects on health and wellbeing. Barsi
is a first-generation Black woman from a low-income family. Barsi is a stellar student and has clear potential for
a high-impact research career in population science studying the market-based policy mechanisms that shape
poverty, health, and wellbeing in the United States. Barsi has developed an innovative, rigorous, and well-
designed research agenda. As a CDE trainee, she will benefit from the integration of tools from sociology,
economics, and population health to develop her research. Barsi will receive weekly professional development
training, including in reproducibility and responsible research. She will receive committed mentorship from an
interdisciplinary team of CDE faculty Jesse Gregory (Economics) and Katherine Curtis (Sociology), both
with excellent training records. NIH support will make possible Barsi’s development into a highly skilled early-
career researcher in the population sciences."

 Our program goal is to train talented young scientists for research-intensive and research-related careers
in reproductive biology. Baylor College of Medicine is a long-standing leader in reproductive biology research.
Predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees receive mentored training in biomedical research and career development
to obtain skills necessary for a variety of career paths. The predoctoral program combines state-of-the-art training
in premier reproductive biology laboratories along with didactic learning. Postdoctoral fellows attend courses and
seminars alongside their research training. Both will have structured committees for research and career advising
that include a formal oral presentation. Trainee mentorship is guided by program-specific Individual Development
Plans (IDP), developed in conjunction with the mentor and a core executive committee member. Activities to
enhance skills in teaching, clinical/translational work, and entrepreneurship, is offered by BCM and neighboring
collaborative institutions within the world's largest medical center. Program specific activities include a mentored
journal club, an annual mini-symposium, research advisory committees, NRMN modules for mentor-mentee
training, formal critiques of oral communications, assistance with development of fellowship applications, and
individual career planning programs. These programs are supplemented with training in responsible conduct of
research and a novel “ethics in reproductive health learning unit” specifically designed for this proposal. The 13
faculty members have been selected for contemporary research interests in reproductive biology and are
currently supported by over $14 million in funding with $6 million in NICHD funding alone (43% of total PI
funding). Their research areas fall squarely within the mission of NICHD, and includes studies of key reproductive
biology proteins, normal and pathophysiology of male and female reproductive tissues, genetic and
environmental factors that affect fertility, and translational research (male contraceptive development and
developmental origins of adult disease). The training faculty use cutting edge approaches to study reproductive
processes using genetic models, patient samples, in vitro models, and clinical data. Our program is designed for
three predoctoral students and four postdoctoral fellows. We plan to support trainees for two years with an option
to compete for a third year. Due to the long-standing reproductive biology research program at BCM and an
active national recruiting strategy, we currently have a strong applicant pool in our training labs from which to
select trainees, including pre- and postdoctoral trainees from UR groups. In total, our program provides
necessary skills and experience to prepare the next generation of scientists for successful and diverse careers
in reproductive biology."

The objectives for this proposal are (1) determining the optimal chemical preparation to inject into the implant for
delivery of Naltrexone (NTX) to minimize toxicity while maximizing efficacy, (2) determine the optimal
composition and porosity of the drug delivery implant to achieve the therapeutic serum levels of NTX as well as
(3) refinement of the surgical procedure and instrumentation to facilitate the safe and effective deployment of
the implant. To address these issues, the study team will execute the following specific aims: Aim 1: Validate
two formulations of NTX, liposomal encapsulation and PLGA encapsulation, for sustained release from the
implant with proof of in vitro stability and pharmacokinetics under GLP/GCP. Aim 2: Assess surgical procedure
and specialized instruments for replicable and safe implantation. Aim 3: Optimize the NTX drug formulation
and implant design in vivo. Aim 4: Complete a six to twelve-month study to verify the safety and efficacy of the
NTX implant needed for an Investigational New Drug/Investigational Device Exemption Application and
clinical trials.
As the opioid crisis lingers, the proposed study has direct application to the health concerns of the nation and to
the NIH as the study team seeks a fundamental solution and answer to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce
illness and disability for those suffering from an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD).
The phases of the project will include: engineering, surgical technique refinement, pharmaceutical formulation,
bioanalytical evaluation - both: in vivo and in vitro, surgical implantation in 2 species, collection of the
pharmacokinetic bio-analytical data, toxicology/necropsy studies and analysis of the data. Specific tests and
comparisons will include NTX formulation (dissolution groups and 1-month in vivo (rodent)), balloon material
in vivo, (rodent), therapeutic (6 to 12 month in vivo rodent and canine), and control (6 to 12 month in vivo
rodent and canine) and opioid/fentanyl challenge in canines. Upon successful conclusion of the in vivo trials
with proven efficacy and safety, FDA approval and clinical trials will begin.
In the phase I study, we plan on testing 3 different doses of NI along with a placebo loaded implant in healthy
volunteers. The phase 2 clinical trial of the NI will be performed in subjects with OUD to determine the
efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the NI. We will assess two doses of NI and compare this to
the efficacy of a commercially available one month extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) (Vivitrol, Alkermes)
given monthly for six months."
11014162,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Unlike adult alcohol exposure, the cellular and behavioral effects of adolescent binge drinking do not recover following
periods of abstinence, suggesting that alcohol exposure across adolescence has the potential to permanently disrupt the
brain’s developmental trajectory. However, while prior research has focused on the underlying mechanisms driving this
loss and restoration of newborn hippocampal neurons, no research has investigated how adolescent intermittent
ethanol (AIE) impacts the ability of surviving hippocampal neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) to appropriately integrate into
adult hippocampal circuitry. In order to test the impact of adolescent alcohol on network integration of developing
neurons, we will use a reporter mouse line (DCX-CreERT2/tdtomato) which was developed to specifically tag and then
fate-map NPCs across their lifespan. This technique will allow us to track how alcohol impacts the ability of adolescent
maturing neurons to effectively integrate into mature dentate circuitry. We will test whether AIE impairs proper
formation of dendritic arborization in adolescent-maturing NPCs (AIM 1/K99). We will then test whether adolescent
alcohol further impairs the electrophysiological properties of these NPCs in adulthood (AIM 2/K99). As it remains unclear
whether maturational changes in neurons mediate loss of behavioral flexibility, we will test whether adolescent ethanol
impairs neuronal activation in response to behavioral flexibility tasks (AIM 3/K99). However, due to the additional
burdens of childcare following the birth of my firstborn son, Leonardo Preston (4/18/2023), I am requesting this
supplement to support hiring a research technician in order to expedite the immunohistochemical components of the
parent grant. The aims of this project will remain unchanged with this supplement request, and the technical training
aspects of this grant (ex vivo electrophysiology, Aim 2) will continued to be performed by myself. Collectively, these
experiments will provide critical insight into the impact of adolescent alcohol on the resulting phenotypic fate and circuit
regulation of surviving NPCs in both sexes."
11013179,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 500,000 Americans are living with end-stage kidney disease, and most of them require life-
sustaining hemodialysis treatments three times a week. Despite major improvements over the past several
decades, the average life expectancy for dialysis patients is still only 5-10 years. Moreover, the financial burden
is significant: dialysis patients comprise about 1% of those on Medicare, yet their care accounts for over 7% of
the Medicare budget. There is a pressing need to improve both patient outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of
hemodialysis treatment; the single most important problem facing patients being treated with hemodialysis is
safe and reliable cannulation. To address these challenges, we developed an implantable device that aims to
improve vascular access. The device features a 3D-printed titanium shell that accurately guides the hemodialysis
needle to the correct insertion point, while a titanium-nitride coated valve stops bleeding immediately upon
needle removal. This new cutting-edge device minimizes the risks for infection, incorrect needle placement, and
excessive bleeding, making hemodialysis treatments safer, more efficient, and easier to administer. In this phase-
I SBIR proposal, we will use state-of-the-art materials and engineering techniques to refine the manufacturability
and operational parameters of our device. Then through a large animal preclinical study, we will evaluate device
functionality, tissue integration, inflammatory profile as well as infection and bleeding risks. Our results will pave
the way for a comprehensive large-scale GLP-certified animal study and a first-in-human trial. Our device has
the potential to be a disruptive technology in nephrology, improve the quality of life for dialysis patients, and
possibly facilitate wider adoption of home-based hemodialysis treatments."

The camera on our main research microscope has failed and we are functioning only through a
loaner from our microscope representative. We request support through this administrative
supplement mechanism to replace the 5-series camera and upgrade the system from Windows
7, ZenLite imaging software. This microscope and camera are our workhorses in the lab for
imaging microinjections and micromanipulations, live embryo imaging, whole mount immune
localization and RNA-hybridization imaging. We can function only as long as the representatives
from Zeiss allow us to keep the loaner camera. The research supported by this request is
focused on understanding the mechanisms of formation of primordial germ cells during
embryogenesis, how they form during early development, and how they regenerate when the
originals are removed. Our work leverages embryos from a sister group to chordates – the sea
star and sea urchin. While not common organisms for biomedical research, these echinoderms
have many strategic benefits for revealing unique perspectives in the biology of germline
formation and regeneration. Millions of synchronous embryos from a single male/female cross
allow biochemical and metabolic analysis of the germline, the resultant embryos have ideal
transparency for in vivo longitudinal imaging, they develop rapidly, are easy to manipulate
(single cell drop-mRNA-seq, optogenetics, cell and tissue transplantations) and they are well
suited to complementary gene perturbation approaches (CRISPR/Cas9, morpholino antisense
oligonucleotides, MASO), and small molecule perturbations. The existing deep genomic and
reagent resources for these animals, coupled with their tractable experimental characteristics,
yields a unique system for understanding primordial germ cell biology with defined molecular
and morphological endpoints, in live embryos with longitudinal analysis, distinct metrics of
quantitation, and transgenerational evaluations."

 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism.
Clinical studies on patients being seen in specialized clinics have shown that this X-linked disorder has a
substantial impact on the health and well-being of patients and families. FXS remains significantly
underdiagnosed despite increased emphasis on identification of individuals with FXS, patient advocacy, and
accessibility of genetic testing. The impact of this condition across racial and ethnic groups is unknown and the
rate and prevalence of co-occurring conditions has not yet been characterized using representative populations.
An unmet need exists to develop novel pre-screening approaches that are able to alert physicians to potentially
undiagnosed cases and refer them for genetic testing. This application proposes research that will not only
advance knowledge of clinical risk associated with FXS but will also offer insight into development of innovative
pre-screening approaches that can improve diagnostic practices for other complex underdiagnosed conditions.
 The present research will be the largest population-level study of health characteristics of individuals with
FXS from diverse racial and ethnic patient groups. The electronic health records (EHRs) from more than 15
million patients in CAPriCORN (the Chicago Area Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Network) will be used
for this study. CAPriCORN includes 11 different health care systems/sites (with one FXS Specialized Clinic) in
metropolitan Chicago. 1008 patients have been identified who have a diagnostic code for FXS in their
EHRs (318 females, 690 males) of whom 293 are Non-White, 110 are Hispanic, and the others are non-
Hispanic Whites. By including patients from diverse racial and ethnic groups, and by utilizing discovery-oriented
approaches and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, our proposed research will evaluate phenotypic
characteristics of individuals with FXS more representative of the US population.
 Our Specific Aims are: (1) To detect the rate of FXS diagnosis (and under-diagnosis) in patients from diverse
racial and ethnic groups; (2) To characterize the diagnostic patterns in FXS patients from diverse racial and
ethnic groups; and (3) To construct an AI-assisted pre-screening tool to find potential cases with FXS who have
not yet been diagnosed and validate the tool with racially and ethnically diverse patient groups. Additionally, we
will investigate the impact of access to specialty clinics by characterizing the differences/similarities in age of
diagnosis, diagnostic odyssey, and health care utilization between patients served by the Fragile X Clinic at Rush
University and patients from other CAPriCORN sites. We have organized a multidisciplinary team of scientists
with expertise in biostatistics, biomedical informatics, genetics, pediatrics, developmental psychology,
epidemiology, and social science. With substantial experience in using EHR data for clinical and translational
research, and with a long successful track record of conducting collaborative multi-institutional studies on FXS,
our team has exceptional ability to achieve these research goals."

11023728,"Menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) is a major cause of distress, disability, and development of chronic pelvic pain
(CPP). Very little is known about how local uterine inflammation and central neural dysregulation interact to
cause painful periods. Understanding their interaction and how it might worsen central neural hypersensitivity
is essential to prevent dysmenorrhea from progressing into CPP conditions like bladder pain syndrome,
irritable bowel syndrome, or endometriosis. There are two factors in dysmenorrhea we have studied that hold
promise as targets to reduce future risk of CPP – the presence of co-occurring bladder hypersensitivity and the
individual response to common anti-inflammatory treatments. The expansion of pain from one pelvic organ to
nearby ones suggests sensory processing dysregulation in the spinal cord or brain. Our preliminary data
shows that effective NSAID therapy for dysmenorrhea may reduce future CPP risk by normalizing local nerve
activation, inflammatory molecules in the uterine lining, and painful hypersensitivity in adjacent pelvic organs.
To distinguish the role of different sensory mechanisms in CPP progression, our interdisciplinary team will use
a collection of validated sensory tasks involving mechanical, thermal, electrical stimulation and bladder filling.
Our proposal also pairs high-density electroencephalography with sensory testing to identify brain differences
related to abnormal pain interpretation. We plan to administer these tasks along with symptom questionnaires
to understand why some women with menstrual pain respond better to NSAIDs, and which factors predict
diminished CPP risk following an optimized program to reduce menstrual pain. In Aim 1 we will conduct a one-
year, randomized controlled trial (n=300) of optimized NSAID vs. placebo treatment for period pain in
moderate-plus dysmenorrhea sufferers. We will determine whether active treatment, menstrual pain relief, and
lower levels of uterine inflammatory molecules predict lower nonmenstrual pelvic pain (NMPP, a marker for
future CPP risk) at one year post-treatment. Aim 2, conducted within the Aim 1 study structure, will establish
which specific sensory tests predict reductions in NMPP following treatment. EEG will be used to pinpoint
precise mechanisms for differences in these sensory responses. Collectively, this study of higher-risk women is
designed to characterize how menstrual pain and bladder hypersensitivity interact to promote CPP, and if these
factors predict who benefits from early preventative treatment. The approach is novel for using a sample of
women enriched for future pain risk (women with dysmenorrhea and bladder pain) and for conducting future
pain-risk prediction with recognized factors: sensory testing profiles, adjacent organ pain involvement, and
observed response to a targeted treatment. Structural equation modeling will be used to formally define how
these interact to cause CPP while controlling for other key pain risk factors, such as relative local inflammation
and psychosocial profiles. These study results obtained by a diverse team of interdisciplinary collaborators are
expected to markedly improve our understanding of pain risk heterogeneity for chronic pain prevention"
11011934,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obstetric fistula is a traumatic maternal morbidity resulting in severe urinary incontinence that increases stigma
and reduces quality of life. The two million women with fistula, most in sub-Saharan Africa, face substantial multi-
level barriers to surgical repair. Women need an acceptable non-surgical option for therapeutic
management of fistula-related urinary incontinence, yet no non-surgical standard of care exists. Use of
an insertable silicone vaginal cup has great potential for fistula management; it is effective for menstrual
management and efficacious at reducing short-term fistula urinary leakage. We propose a clinical trial and nested
qualitative study to 1) quantify the effectiveness of an insertable vaginal cup to manage fistula urinary
incontinence, 2) examine user and implementer acceptability, and 3) quantify fistula management cost.
Two intervention models will be compared among women awaiting fistula surgery or whose surgery was
unsuccessful: 1) a vaginal cup (‘cup’), and 2) the cup attached via rubber tubing to a leg-secured urine collection
bag (‘cup+’) for greater urine holding capacity. Using a cross-over design for efficiency, 100 participants will be
randomized to one of two sequences of leaking freely, cup, and cup+ at two fistula care centers in Ghana and
observed for four days (total observations=400). Each treatment (cup, cup+ or leaking freely) is used for 24h for
day and night use, then crossover. Data are captured through self-report and clinical checklist. On day 4,
participants are re-randomized to use cup or cup+ at home for 3 months. Acceptability assessment is informed
by implementation and health behavior theory. Aim 1. To quantify the effectiveness and comparative
effectiveness of the cup and cup+. The trial will compare objective and patient-reported measures of
effectiveness of the cup and cup+ to leaking freely and of the cup to the cup+. Short-term assessment will be
objective (urinary leakage; 8, 24hrs), long-term assessment will be patient-reported (QoL; 1-3 months). Aim 2.
To examine acceptability of cup and cup+. User and implementer acceptability will be assessed using a
sequential explanatory mixed-methods design. Acceptability among trial participants will be measured
longitudinally (1-3 months). User and implementer acceptability will be examined within in-depth interviews of
selected trial participants (n~30) at 3 months and potential implementers (ob/gyns, midwives/nurses, community
health workers, n~20). Aim 3. To explore the material and opportunity costs to non-surgical fistula
management. Surveys and time motion study among trial participants at facility and community will estimate
direct and indirect costs of fistula management from a patient perspective. The long-term goal of the proposed
work is to overcome barriers to comprehensive fistula care and increase quality of life through an acceptable,
non-surgical option for therapeutic management of fistula."
11011953,"American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIAN) are disproportionately impacted by the burden of cancer. Compared
to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States (US), AIAN individuals face higher rates of many cancers,
later stages at diagnosis, worse outcomes after diagnosis, and lower rates of cancer survival. The Partnership
for Native American Cancer Prevention (NACP), a 21-year collaboration between Northern Arizona University
(NAU) and the University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC), has made impactful strides that successfully
address the causal factors that drive AIAN cancer inequities. NACP has had a significant positive impact on
the pipeline of AIAN individuals seeking careers related to cancer health research, including the training of
Native investigators poised to be leaders in this field. NACP has been a driver of institutional change at both
NAU and UACC by fostering an increase in cancer research capacity at NAU and health disparity-focused
research at UACC and by elevating both institutions’ commitments to serving AIAN students and communities.
NACP has built a strong foundation of relationships with tribal communities, governments, and other partners,
based on trust and respect, and this is resulting in an acceleration of the positive impacts driven by NACP’s
activities, both present and future. NACP is poised to realize past investments while sustaining current
relationships and expanding interactions to additional tribal communities in Arizona. The NACP remains
committed to its core goals of reducing the burden of cancer within AIAN populations through research and
community engagement, growing the number of AIAN investigators participating in the cancer research
workforce, and increasing the total number of investigators focused on cancer health disparities within Native
Arizona communities. While these overall goals remain consistent, NACP is introducing an operational
framework to systematically incorporate Indigenous perspectives as a core reference to guide and thread
together its work. NACP will embrace the ‘two-eyed seeing’ paradigm, which seeks to “see from one eye with
the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of
Western knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both of these eyes together for the benefit of all.”
Aim 1. To engage in bidirectional communication grounded in the principle of reciprocity with our AIAN
community partners to promote best practices with respect to cancer health and to develop research priorities
and programs that address AI cancer health disparities.
Aim 2. To grow the pipeline of cancer-focused Indigenous researchers and health care professionals through
educational and training programs tailored to high school, undergraduates, graduate students, junior
investigators, and early-stage investigators.
Aim 3. Conduct impactful cancer disparity focused research that is informed by and inclusive of tribal
community priorities and concerns."
11024864,"Project Abstract:
Suicide is now the leading cause of death during the perinatal period, and nearly a quarter of maternal deaths
are attributable to behavioral health (BH) conditions. As with maternal mortality and morbidity overall, poor
perinatal BH outcomes disproportionately affect historically marginalized communities of color. Despite the
prevalence and life-threatening nature of perinatal BH conditions, only 11% of individuals with these conditions
during pregnancy or postpartum receive needed care, and individuals from marginalized and under-resourced
populations are less likely to be screened or treated for BH conditions. Telehealth has enormous potential to
address the maternal morbidity and mortality crisis by improving access to perinatal BH care. It has been
shown to increase health care access and reduce missed appointments for BH care, particularly among
individuals from underserved communities. Research overwhelmingly finds comparable efficacy between in-
person and telebehavioral health (TBH) care. Finally, telehealth can help overcome particularly salient barriers
for pregnant and postpartum people. Few studies have examined TBH in the perinatal period, but evidence
suggests that TBH services for pregnant and postpartum people provide equivalent benefit to those delivered
in-person. Importantly, pregnant and postpartum individuals from historically marginalized populations, (e.g.,
Medicaid-insured; those living in rural areas; those with disabilities; and members of racial and ethnic minority
groups), face additional health care barriers, including structural racism, language barriers, and provider
shortages. The extent to which TBH diminishes or amplifies these specific barriers and reduces BH disparities
is unknown. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated policy changes to make telehealth services more
widely available. However, state-level Medicaid policies are not uniform, and not all states retained pandemic-
era expansions in their reimbursement policy. As policies influencing availability of telehealth continue to
evolve, quantifying policy impacts on perinatal BH care access and outcomes, and better understanding the
mechanisms driving those impacts, are critical to using TBH more effectively to address maternal morbidity
and mortality from untreated perinatal BH conditions. To fill these gaps, this mixed-methods study will (1)
Develop a detailed, longitudinal dataset describing the evolution of state-level telehealth policies with relevance
to perinatal behavioral healthcare for individuals insured by Medicaid; (2) Use event-time modeling to estimate
the relationship between telehealth policies of interest and key behavioral health outcomes (e.g., emergency
department visits, overdoses, and suicide) and maternal-infant outcomes (e.g., maternal morbidity, preterm
delivery), with a focus on identifying inequities by race/ethnicity, rural residence, and disability status; and (3)
Apply the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research in a series of in-depth interviews with patients
and providers to explain the quantitative findings through an examination of factors that influence telehealth
policy implementation and associated health outcomes."

The kidney transplant waitlist comprises 83% of the U.S. organ transplant waitlist- yet, for every 5 waitlist patients
who die, or become too sick for transplantation, 3 potentially transplantable kidneys are discarded. Infants and small
children on the waitlist have a higher organ discard rate than adults due to locality and timeframe constraints.
Extending and improving kidney preservation would enable nationwide (eventually global) donor-recipient matching
for these young children and also allowing additional good quality kidneys not transplanted today to be offered to
older patients. Long duration kidney preservation can also enable translation of clinical immune tolerance induction
avoiding life-long immunosuppression. Using effective cryoprotective agents (CPAs) our team and others have
successfully cryopreserved tissues in an ice-free vitreous “glassy” state, allowing for indefinite storage. Unfortunately,
these advances had not been matched by similar advances to prevent damage from ice growth and/or fracturing
during rewarming. Recently, our co-PIs Dr. Finger and Dr. Bischof demonstrated a scalable and biocompatible
nanowarming technology using radiofrequency (RF)-excited iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) for ice and fracture
avoidance during rewarming from cryogenic storage. The nanowarming technology led to the successful completion
of our Phase I study resulting in: 1) optimized CPA selection, permeation, and critical cooling and warming rates
for kidney slices, and 2) established vitrification and nanowarming for whole rat and, beyond the initial Phase I
scope, rabbit kidneys. Subsequently, Dr. Bischof’s team has demonstrated the world’s first and only, successful,
repeat transplants of mammalian kidneys after cryogenic preservation. Building on this unprecedented
achievement and the Phase I feasibility success, we here scale-up and apply this new technology to neonatal
and pediatric kidney preservation, where the physics of heat transfer make it exponentially less challenging to
cryopreserve smaller (younger) organs compared to adult organs. Our goal will be achieved via 3 Aims: 1)
vitrification and nanowarming of whole juvenile porcine model kidney with i) optimization of pediatric size
kidney vitrification protocols as well as ii) identification of potential mechanism(s) of any remaining injury, 2)
optimization of vitrification cocktails and perfusion protocols for neonate, infant, and small children human
kidneys, with (i) biocompatible cryostasis cocktails and (ii) effective revival/reconditioning protocols for enhanced
reperfusion, 3) orthotopic survival autotransplantation with long-term survival, with the best protocols from SA
1-2 and compared via current ex vivo clinical assessment practices ahead of proof of concept for 100+ days
storage and transplantation in juvenile pigs, and human decedent recipients. Altogether, this constitutes an
important standalone project enabling further breakthroughs in biopreservation, tissue engineering, biomedical
research, and clinical practice. This will set the stage for our logistical model of centralized centers of excellence
for preservation and assessment, enabling vastly improved clinical outcomes and patients’ access globally."

The project will establish honeybee larvae as a model for microbial pathogenesis, identify antimicrobial proteins,
and foster collaboration between the Rowley (INBRE) and Van Leuven (COBRE) laboratories. Vulvovaginal
candidiasis (VVC) is a prevalent condition affecting 75% of women worldwide and is often caused by Candida
species of yeast. Understanding the pathogenesis of VVC has been hampered by the lack of a model organism
that mimics the acidic pH and predominance of Lactobacillus species in the human vaginal mucosa. The project
innovation lies in the use of honeybee larvae as a novel insect model for VVC and integrates the complementary
expertise of the Rowley and Van Leuven laboratories. INBRE investigator Rowley and COBRE investigator Van
Leuven specialize in microbial pathogenesis and microbiomes. Both investigators use insect models and have
realized the unique collaborative opportunities presented by their respective research programs to develop and
test a novel insect model of the human vaginal tract. The research will leverage the unique characteristics of
honeybee larvae, such as conserved innate immune mechanisms and midgut acidification by Lactobacillus
species. The project studies the pathogenicity of Candida yeasts, the disease-protective role of Lactobacillus
species, and investigates novel antimicrobial compounds. The project has three Specific Aims: 1- Develop the
collaboration between INBRE investigator Rowley and COBRE investigator Van Leuven; 2 - COBRE investigator
Van Leuven will develop honeybee larvae as a model system for Candida pathogenesis; and 3 - INBRE
investigator Rowley will identify antimicrobial proteins produced by Lactobacillus that are active
against pathogens. The project will make extensive use of PUI undergraduate student researchers in all
stated research aims. Both laboratories are committed to providing technical training, mentorship, and
supervision to all students involved in the project to ensure high standards of reproducibility, rigor, and safety.
In summary, the research adopts an innovative and collaborative approach, utilizing the honeybee model to
advance understanding and potentially unveil novel therapeutic approaches for VVC."
11011956,"Approximately 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer were diagnosed in the US in 2018. While the cervical
cancer mortality rate declined, approximately 4,000 women still die from this disease every year. According to
Indian Health Service data from 1999-2009, Native American (NA) women had approximately a two-fold higher
incidence and associated mortality rate than White women. Hispanic and NA women have the highest rates of
cervical cancer in Arizona, with respectively, 7.8 and 7.1 cases per 100,000 women. While HPV is the known
etiologic agent of cervical cancer, few studies were conducted to estimate HPV prevalence within NA
communities. Among those studies, it was reported that 22.2% of NA women from the Hopi reservation in
northeastern Arizona tested positive for HPV infection. The deficiencies of both cervical screening and higher
HPV prevalence are likely contributors to cervical cancer disparities among NA women. Yet, evidence
suggests an association of HPV infection, persistence, and disease progression with vaginal microbiota (VMB)
features, which were reported to differ across socioeconomic or ethnic/racial groups. Despite differences in
cervical cancer rates between racial and ethnic groups, little is known about the patterns of HPV infection and
VMB composition in NA communities, or how these factors relate to increased cervical cancer risk. In fact,
most prior studies do not include NA women. We hypothesize that there are dual factors (Indigenous
perceptions and biological factors within the cervicovaginal microenvironment) that contribute to HPV
persistence and, ultimately, cervical cancer health disparities in Native women. For this 3-year full project, we
will continue working with the MedStar Health Research Institute in Phoenix, AZ. Thus, the aims of this project
are to (1) assess the knowledge and perspectives of cultural practices, HPV-associated cancers, and
STI knowledge among urban NA women, and (2) define changes in the vaginal microbiota and
immunometabolic milieu in a longitudinal study of urban NA women to better understand the
relationship between these factors and HPV infection, persistence, and clearance. From these aims, we
will (1) determine the prevalence of modifiable risk factors and behaviors for HPV infection and HPV-related
cancers among NA women; (2) assess knowledge and perceptions regarding HPV-related cancers among NA
women; (3) determine the individual HPV status, levels of vaginal inflammatory mediators, metabolites and the
VMB abundance in NA women across a longitudinal study; (4) evaluate the risk factors associated with
prevalent HPV types and the VMB; and (5) conduct integrated multi-omics analysis in NA women focused on
features of the local microenvironment associated with HPV status. Therefore, this 3-year full project will
include culturally-informed community-based biomedical research and apply Two Eyed Seeing as a
guiding principle with the long-term goal of reducing health disparities that impact NA communities that

11011958,"American Indian (AI) communities experience higher rates of liver cancer incidence and mortality than the
general United States (U.S.) population, particularly in the Southwest Region. Common risk factors for liver
cancer include having hepatitis B or hepatitis C, cirrhosis, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of physical
activity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and obesity. Notably, a disproportionate prevalence of
obesity-related diseases is experienced by AI people in the U.S. when compared to all other racial/ethnic
groups, making their health status a key public health issue. Despite the clear need to develop effective liver
cancer prevention strategies, health disparities remain among AI communities and within the scientific
literature. To address these significant health disparities, the interdisciplinary team and Pascua Yaqui Tribe will
investigate strategies to improve liver cancer prevention and health equity for AI communities. We will apply
the ‘two-eyed seeing’ paradigm to see from one eye with the strengths of the Yoeme knowledge and ways of
knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths integrated scientific approaches for community-engaged
research methods. This high impact effort will advance research for liver cancer prevention in a high-risk group
that carries a disparate liver cancer burden. The Specific Aims are to: 1) examine Yoeme adults’ attitudes and
beliefs of liver cancer health risk (e.g., lifestyle, diet, lived experiences, biological, environmental); 2) assess
the prevalence and characterize risk factors for NAFLD, a known risk factor for liver cancer, in a sample of 150
adults recruited from a Pascua Yaqui clinic; and 3) determine the potential for the implementation and
dissemination with reciprocity of an existing evidence-based lifestyle-based intervention (DPTP) tailored for
NAFLD risk reduction in clinic-based settings. The study team’s efforts are centered in developing a
sustainable research agenda for Yoeme communities that fosters interdisciplinary, collaborative research,
education, and outreach. This proposed study directly benefits the community by 1) creating representative
scientific evidence that can inform health policy and clinical guidelines, 2) increasing access to health services
(e.g., liver disease screening) that improve understanding of risk factors related to liver cancer, 3) building
culturally relevant research capacity within Yoeme communities that experience a disproportionate burden of
obesity-related health disparities, and 4) providing valuable research training to Yoeme people and early-
career investigators. Further, this study will provide the interdisciplinary research team, led by Dr. David O.

11011886,"Project Summary
Single-stranded RNA bacteriophages (ssRNA phages) are small near-icosahedral viruses that
use RNA as genetic material to infect bacteria through retractile pili. Recently >15,000 new ssRNA
phages have been identified but their hosts and mechanisms of infection remain unknown. Of the
steps during the infection cycle of ssRNA phages, how phages package the genomic RNA and
recognize its specific host are only known for model ssRNA coliphages such as MS2 and Qβ; and
how RNA is ultimately delivered into the cytosol is obscure. From the preliminary data, the PIs
find that the previous paradigm set for the infection mechanism of ssRNA phage based on model
coliphages can no longer be applied to other ssRNA phages.
Host receptors of ssRNA phages, the retractile pili, are usually involved in the virulence of
pathogenic bacteria and the sharing of antibiotic-resistant plasmids. This project will focus on
phages PP7 and AP205, which infect Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp.,
respectively, via the Type IV pili (T4P). The overall goal is to determine the mechanisms involved
in PP7/AP205 packaging, and RNA penetration into the host, a process which involves both host
recognition and RNA entry. Specific aims are to reveal the molecular mechanisms for (1) the
packaging of PP7/AP205, (2) the interplay between PP7/AP205 and T4P before RNA entry, and
(3) the detachment of T4P during RNA entry. This work will not only reveal insights into the
infection mechanism of ssRNA phages but also provide guidelines to engineer ssRNA phages for
the following purpose: ssRNA phages will be engineered as means to detach pili of pathogenic
bacteria, as an alternative strategy for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Unlike
traditional phage therapy by lysing pathogens, virulence and antibiotic resistance spread are
inactivated by breaking pili while leaving the cells to grow, without exerting selective pressure on
the host to develop further resistance. Such a method also avoids the release of any unwanted
cell contents including DNA, proteins, and toxins into the environment which could interfere with
other bacteria or affect human cells. In the future, the proposed project will also provide a basis
for developing a method for packaging and delivery of a large number of foreign RNAs into
bacterial cells. Due to the short life of RNAs inside the cell, they allow transient regulation of the
cells and are less likely to exert long-term genetic effects as in the case of DNA plasmids. In
addition, RNA delivery with ssRNA phages does not rely on the artificial preparation of cells
competent for heat-shock or electroporation, which is hard to perform in situ."

11031447,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a prominent element of many leading causes of disability, namely cerebrovascular
and neurodegenerative diseases. The function and stability of mitochondria are tightly regulated by the
mechanisms of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control (QC). The dynamic nature of mitochondria is
maintained by the balancing forces of fission and fusion. These processes of mitochondrial dynamics operate to
preserve the functional architecture of the mitochondrial network. The mechanisms of mitochondrial QC,
including mitophagy, proteostasis, and biogenesis, work to regulate the components of the mitochondrial network
through synthesis and degradation. These forces actively control the functionality of the mitochondrial network
to ensure efficient energy production. In cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, the processes of mitochondrial
dynamics and QC become dysregulated, contributing to metabolic dysfunction and neurological damage. The
F99 phase of this proposal aims to identify the phases of disrupted mitochondrial dynamics and QC in cerebral
I/R injury, and their respective molecular mechanisms. Utilizing advanced technologies related to machine
learning, computational modeling, and live cell imaging, I have created an agent-based model of mitochondrial
dynamics for these investigations. This model allows for the simulation of the dynamic actions of individual
mitochondrial units to culminate in the complex patterns normally observed in mammalian cells. Live cell imaging
of mouse primary cortical neurons from novel transgenic reporter lines (i.e., MitoTimer, MitoQC) and conditional
knockout lines will be utilized to observe the respective contributions of individual dynamics proteins to the
patterns of mitochondrial morphology. Knockout neurons will be exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD),
an in vitro model of I/R injury, and mitochondrial parameters (i.e., morphology, oxidation) will be imaged in real
time to generate a mechanistic timeline of mitochondrial dynamics. These live cell recordings will be used to
optimize and expand our agent-based model to allow for in silico experimental manipulation of mitochondrial
proteins. Our expanded model will have the ability to test hypotheses regarding the basal and pathological rates
of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control, as well as inform future experiments with decreased costs and
increased efficiency. In the K00 phase of this proposal, I will transition from studying mitochondrial quality control
in I/R to its study in neurodegeneration. Utilizing the technical skills acquired in the predoctoral phase, I will
investigate age-related changes in mitochondrial proteostasis and critical long-lived mitochondrial proteins at the
synapse. The K00 phase aims to determine how aging affects the turnover of synaptic mitochondrial proteins,
with specific emphasis on the roles of intramitochondrial proteostasis and the integrated stress response. I intend
to determine the contribution of mitochondrial proteostasis to synaptic stability and related neurodegeneration.
This work has significant implications in aging and neurodegeneration research, as synaptic loss and
mitochondrial dysfunction are both hallmarks of age-related neurological diseases."
11019886,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), such as gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, are
increasing yearly across the United States with a persistent racial inequity in prevalence and consequent
morbidity. Black birthing people are more likely to develop preeclampsia, more likely to suffer a severe
maternal morbidity, and more likely to develop cardiovascular disease compared to White counterparts. There
is growing evidence that health-related social needs, such as housing instability, contribute to this
inequity. While non-U.S. nativity imparts a protective effect against adverse pregnancy outcomes and chronic
disease, a finding deemed the “immigrant paradox,” there is emerging evidence that it does not protect against
racial inequities in pregnancy outcomes, including a higher rate of preterm birth and hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy among Black, non-U.S. born mothers compared to White non-U.S. born mothers. Over the past
several years, there has been a shifting demographic of migrants arriving in the U.S., with unprecedented
numbers traversing the U.S.-Mexico border under arduous conditions, prompting the need to examine the
impact of nativity on inequities in outcomes related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This project will
examine inequities by nativity in postpartum outcomes at a large safety-net hospital with a diverse patient
population that is 40% Black, 40% Hispanic, and 60% foreign born. Our proposal will use electronic medical
record data on 6,000 deliveries with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy occurring from 2017-2023 and
proposes a novel assessment of health-related social needs using algorithms informed by screening tools,
social work contacts, and referral letters, to conduct the following aims: (1) examine disparities by nativity in
postpartum cardiovascular related outcomes, including hypertension and repeat hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy, (2) assess mediation between nativity and postpartum cardiovascular related outcomes by various
constructs of health-related social needs, such as housing instability. The ultimate goal of this research is to
harness an existing data in the medical record and use an intersectionality framework to conduct an in-depth
examination of disparities by nativity and intersections of nativity with race and ethnicity. Furthermore, in
alignment with the parent award (R01-HL158864) examining cardiovascular related severe maternal morbidity,
this administrative supplement will generate evidence that is critical in understanding postpartum outcomes in
the face of a changing demographic experienced at an urban, safety-net hospital that mirrors nationwide
trends."
11019935,"Project Summary/Abstract
Sexual minority women (SMW) are one of the highest-risk groups for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
hazardous drinking (HD), and comorbid PTSD and HD (PTSD-HD); disparities are heightened for those with
multiple minoritized identities. These disparities are rooted in SMW’s disproportionate and cumulative exposure
to sexual identity-specific and intersectional forms of stigma, trauma, and lack of safety. The self-medication
model posits that alcohol is often used to reduce distressing PTSD symptoms. Yet, few studies have tested the
temporal precedence of PTSD in HD development and maintenance, especially in SMW. Sensitization to
repeated psychosocial stressors may lower SMW’s threshold for tolerating distress, leading to persistent stress
reactivity and PTSD-HD risk. Single-session interventions (SSIs) with cognitive restructuring and exposure
components hold promise for addressing mechanisms (e.g., emotion regulation) underlying PTSD-HD and
broadening access to low-intensity treatments among SMW. The proposed research is within the scope of the

term effects of PTSD on HD, identifying biopsychosocial drivers of PTSD-HD, and guiding the initial adaption of
an SSI targeting cognitive reappraisal to mitigate stress reactivity, PTSD symptoms, and alcohol craving

30 SMW and 5 Community Advisory Board members from Aim 2 about the acceptability, feasibility, and
improvement of an affirmative SSI focused on cognitive reappraisal and tailored to address personalized stress
cues for SMW with PTSD-HD. Findings will inform a future planned R01 to assess stress reactivity to stimulus-
specific cues, examine variations in state PTSD symptoms and alcohol craving based on stimulus-specific
stress reactivity, and formally adapt and pilot test a cognitive reappraisal-focused SSI representing the first
brief treatment providing potent, accessible strategies for reducing PTSD-HD in the context of salient cue

11021401,"Summary
Macrophages are critical components of the innate immune system that sample the local environment, respond
to stimuli and return tissues to homeostasis. Distinct macrophage populations play unique roles in these
processes. Macrophages derived from circulating monocytes are rapidly recruited to infections, are
inflammatory, and are generally short-lived. In contrast, long-lived tissue resident macrophages (TRMs) are
derived from fetal liver cells and play an important role in maintaining homeostasis in the absence of infections.
While monocyte-derived macrophages are well defined, due to experimental limitations there remain many
open questions regarding how TRMs are maintained and contribute to regulating the local environment. To
address these key gaps in knowledge my research group is developing new ex vivo models of distinct TRM
populations that can then be probed using functional genetics. We recently developed an ex vivo model for
lung-specific TRMs, alveolar macrophages (AMs), that maintain expression of AM-specific markers and
function. Using this model we engineered a genome-wide knockout library in AM-like cells that enables rapid
forward genetic screens using our customized screening pipeline. Over the next five years my research group
will leverage this innovative resource to dissect underlying biological mechanisms related to AM maintenance
and function. We will comprehensively define the genes required to maintain cells in the AM-like state using a
combination of iterative genetic screens with in-depth functional characterization. These experiments will
uncover entirely novel signaling and transcriptional networks activated in AMs during homeostasis. In parallel,
we will compare the genetic control of core macrophage functions between myeloid-derived macrophages
(BMDMs) and AM-like cells. While there are metabolic and transcriptional differences between BMDMs and
AMs, it remains entirely unknown how these differences alter genetic control of macrophage functions like
phagocytosis. We will complete screens in both BMDMs and AM-like cells probing phagocytosis of distinct
cargo. These datasets will define shared and unique pathways that control core macrophage functions and will
illuminate new mechanisms of fundamental biological processes. Finally, my research group will lay the
groundwork for dissecting genetic pathways in AMs in intact animals by optimizing a cell transfer and
screening pipeline. Using this model, we will uncover the in vivo role of key AM genes and identify new
pathways required for AMs to maintain lung homeostasis. Accomplishing these goals will position my research
group to understand the underlying mechanisms controlling AMs in detail not previously possible. Our long-
term goal is to expand these approaches and findings to more broadly understand other TRM populations by
identifying shared mechanisms of function and maintenance."

The imperative for biomedical engineering research and education is underscored by the widespread prevalence of brain
diseases and disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This emphasizes the urgent need for innovative technologies to
advance our understanding, treatment, and prevention efforts. Recent technological convergence, encompassing
organoids, drug delivery, imaging, machine learning, and regenerative medicine, positions biomedical engineering and
imaging to pioneer groundbreaking solutions, ushering in a new era for human brain health. Organoids and nanodevices
hold significant importance on understanding, diagnosing, and treating neurological diseases/disorders. Amid these
advancements, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of cultivating a diverse and skilled workforce, especially from
underrepresented groups (URGs), in the field of biomedical engineering. The proposed establishment, the ""Center for
Neurovascular Engineering Research and AdVanced Education (NERVE),"" aims to: 1) propel research and education in
biomedical engineering concerning organoid and nanoparticle technologies, 2) enhance capabilities in advanced
imaging/machine learning, and small animal testing, 3) pioneer the first PhD Bioengineering Program at Historically
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), 4) cultivate a diverse workforce encompassing PhD, BS, and MS levels, with a
specific emphasis on underrepresented groups (URGs), and 5) foster a sustainable and innovative ecosystem in
engineering and imaging technologies. This center is built on the strong track record of 1) research on organoid,
nanoparticles, advanced imaging, and neuroscience, 2) education on pioneering BS and MS in Biomedical engineering,
and 3) seamless collaboration across multiple departments, including Bioengineering, Biology, Psychology, and Electrical
Engineering at NC A&T State University (NCAT), in collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh and Washington
University in St. Louis with nationally recognized labs and industry. Benefiting from robust institutional support,
including the Interdisciplinary Bioengineering Center (IBEC) and the PhD Program plan from NCAT, NERVE aims
establish a sustainable hub that transforms brain science and technologies into a lasting ecosystem, charting a course for
the development of the next generation of the bioengineering workforce."
11024212,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This project will test an innovative program of automated screening using natural language processing
(NLP) to improve early recognition of child physical abuse in urgent and emergency care settings. Physical
abuse affects approximately 125,000 US children each year, with infants at highest risk. More than 30% of
children who suffer serious abusive injuries have had prior minor injuries that might have raised the concern for
abuse. Improving the recognition of these including bruises, fractures, and others, is the best opportunity to
prevent recurrent abuse, escalating injury, and death. Missed abuse is especially common in emergency
departments and urgent care settings, and remains a major public health problem despite efforts at education
and awareness-building, routine screening by clinicians, mnemonics, clinical decision rules, and guidelines by
professional societies. These interventions are resource-intensive and depend on human vigilance to
recognize a condition that is rare in each setting, but which has enormous collective impact. Further, these
interventions are vulnerable to bias and may exacerbate racial and ethnic disparities.
 Automated computer screening occurs in the background of clinical care and can overcome limitations of
methods that depend on human effort. We developed and internally validated one automated screener that
uses NLP to analyze unstructured narrative data within the electronic health record. External validation is
needed to determine accuracy in other clinical settings and test the association of high-risk injuries with
subsequent abuse. Further, testing is needed to determine the effect of the screener on racial disparities and
avoidable Child Protective Services reports. If externally validated and shown to be equitable, this NLP
screener could be rapidly adopted in diverse settings. We propose to externally validate this tool and
accomplish these other objectives by determining statewide CPS outcomes (referrals, substantiations, services
provided) for >100,000 urgent care and ED visits for infants in two large healthcare systems. Aim 1: Externally
validate an automated NLP screener to identify infants with high-risk injuries in urgent and emergency care
settings. We will use manual chart review as the criterion standard for visits identified by the NLP screener and
other high-risk encounters. Aim 2: Determine rates of subsequent abuse for infants with high-risk injuries
identified by automated NLP screening but not by usual care. We will link statewide clinical and CPS outcomes
to identify abuse within 12 months for >1100 encounters with high-risk injuries. Aim 3. Determine the potential
impact of NLP on racial disparities.
 The expected outcome of the project is the external validation of an automated abuse recognition tool to
improve recognition and tertiary prevention of abuse. Our innovative methods could also be used to test other
healthcare interventions to improve the recognition of abuse and other conditions."
11025083,"ABSTRACT
 Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness, is characterized by progressive degeneration of the
optic nerve and retinal ganglion cells (RGC). Glaucomatous damage might be caused either by elevated
intraocular pressure (IOP), which could mechanically stress the optic nerve, or by reduced blood flow, which
could impair function of the optic nerve. Lowering IOP is the only available treatment for glaucoma, but many
patients continue to lose vision despite successful IOP reduction. Vascular abnormalities independent of IOP
can occur in glaucoma patients, such as vasospasm and hypertension. While vascular dysfunction is
associated with glaucoma pathophysiology, it remains uncertain whether blood flow impairment can be a target
for intervention. Normalizing blood flow is a compelling novel treatment strategy for glaucoma.
 Our laboratory pioneered the application of multiparametric MRI to image high-resolution lamina-specific
anatomy, quantitative blood flow, and function of the retina and optic nerve in rodents and in humans. This
includes volumetric blood flow MRI of the retina, choroid, and optic nerve head, as well as diffusion MRI to
measure optic nerve axonal integrity. Moreover, we have compelling preliminary data that blood flow is
reduced in an established animal model of glaucoma and that chronic, mild hyperoxia treatment improves
retinal function in glaucoma, supporting a role for blood flow impairment in glaucoma pathogenesis. Herein, we
will utilize our MRI methods to further investigate the role of vascular dysfunction in glaucoma pathology by
assessing a treatment to normalize blood flow in glaucoma.
 The goals of this proposal are to use our novel ocular MRI methods in an established mouse glaucoma
model to: 1) evaluate whether a novel treatment strategy to increase blood flow can prevent glaucomatous
damage and 2) evaluate whether combined treatments to lower IOP and normalize blood flow provide
additional protection against glaucomatous progression. Our central hypothesis is that blood flow dysregulation
contributes to glaucoma pathogenesis, so treatments to normalize blood flow could prevent damage and
ultimately preserve vision in glaucoma.
 The impacts of this study will be i) novel insight into glaucoma pathophysiology and into the contribution of
blood flow abnormalities to irreversible structural and functional damage, ii) establish novel retinal and optic
nerve MRI as a method that provides unique, clinically relevant information on volumetric blood flow, and iii)
establish an innovative treatment strategy for glaucoma of normalizing blood flow. The ultimate impact of this
work would be to prevent blindness and vision loss due to glaucoma."

Of 26 million limited English proficient (LEP) people in the U.S. population (speaking English less than “very
well”), most speak Spanish (63%) and Chinese (7%). The LEP population faces cancer outcomes disparities,
in part due to medical interpretation services barriers. Technology promises efficient, scalable remote
interpreting solutions to bridge the language barrier. However, there is no evidence-based gold standard for
technology- based interpreting. Two technology-based, people-rendered methods used for remote interpreting
are 1) Remote Consecutive Medical Interpreting (RCMI; “audio consecutive”), the most commonly utilized,
and 2) Remote Simultaneous Medical Interpreting (RSMI), “UN-style” simultaneous interpreting applied to
the medical encounter, which may closely approximate a same language encounter, decrease interpreting
errors, and improve outcomes. Further, with artificial intelligence (AI) solutions, there is potential for less
expensive, more scalable interpreting services delivery in the form of AI Simultaneous Medical Interpreting
(AISMI). We will compare RCMI (audio consecutive) (Arm 1), versus RSMI (UN style) (Arm 2) and versus
AISMI (AI UN style) (Arm 3) with Spanish- and Mandarin-speaking actors playing LEP patients and playing
English-speaking providers, to determine comparative error rates of clinical significance and efficiency. We
will write 50 English scripts incorporating content reflecting actual medical oncology encounters. The patient
portion of the scripts will be translated into Spanish and Mandarin. We will have a pool 10 Mandarin and 10
Spanish interpreters. Additionally, we will train a commercially available AI system to provide AISMI for
Spanish and Mandarin speakers. Each script will be human-interpreted twice, once via RSMI and once via
RCMI, and by the AISMI system. There will be 150 interpreted simulations per language (appointments
acted from the scripts with the addition of unscripted live interpreting) that will be audio-recorded and
transcribed (50 for each type of interpreting). We will determine differences in interpreting error rates of
clinical significance (primary outcome) and in interpreting efficiency of utterance (secondary outcome).
Additionally, we will investigate the potential acceptability of AISMI with surveys among Spanish- and
Mandarin-speaking patients and clinicians and administrators. 26 million U.S. people are limited English
proficient, speaking English less than “very well”; lack of access to language interpretation services can
cause limited English proficient patients with cancer to have poor cancer outcomes. There is little information
available on technology-based solutions to providing medical interpretation services. We will compare the
error rates and efficiency of technology-enabled interpretation methods, including remote simultaneous
interpretation (UN style) delivered by artificial intelligence."

This proposed R25 program, Comprehensive Advancement in Research Education and Training for Social
Determinants of Health (CARES), at the Yale University School of Nursing is designed to address existing
gaps in the education and training of nursing researchers in Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). The
purpose of this program is three-fold: First, orient emerging researchers to recognize, appreciate, and
incorporate into their research concepts and principles of SDOH that influence and shape individual and
population health. Second, research methods will be provided and developed toward disentangling multiple
policy and program influences and their health effects. Third, approaches will be shared and developed toward
structural interventions on these upstream factors as they influence health. The curriculum is intensive and
includes the development of academic and community networks which are designed to accelerate them
becoming established investigators. The program is aimed at nurse researchers who are under-represented in
the scientific community. The education and training activities are in three segments that surround an
intensive summer research residency. The first segment involves a monthly online introduction (over five
months) to key concepts and frameworks for SDOH research. The second is a month-long intensive in-
residence (in-person and hybrid) Summer Institute that delves into research method topics while networking
with and mentoring and culminating in a proposal concept development. The third segment is regular and on-
demand coaching with mentors and SDOH research community-building with CARES cohorts through
engagement in an active online network hub during and post-program. The outcome of the program is the
delivery of the SDOH research courses, with an expansion of a social network of researchers that manifests
peer-reviewed publications and competitive grant proposals. With our recruitment plan (via targeted social
network and professional and academic networks), we will host three training cohorts (6-8/cohort) of early
career nursing scholars, specifically including those from racial and ethnic minority identities. Eligibility and
selection for the program include the applicant’s research interest on SDOH research, evidence of institutional
support, and a match of CARES’ mentor and scholar’s interests. Evaluation includes ongoing assessment of
progress, mentoring, and productivity as reviewed by the Steering Committee and the External Advisory Board.
Innovative aspects of the program include a focus on interdisciplinary, simulation-based, and community-
based training and mentoring approach. The CARES program is grounded in the Healthy People 2030
framework and the NIH SDOH Research Framework and seeks to establish a robust foundation in SDOH
research, synthesize evidence across disciplines, enhance research methodology competencies, and cultivate
effective participant engagement and ongoing support strategies. Ultimately, the CARES program will empower
nurse researchers to conduct rigorous and impactful SDOH research and promote health equity for all."
11011012,"The neovascular eye diseases retinopathy of prematurity, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and neovascular
age-related macular degeneration are major causes of blindness through the lifespan. Not all patients respond
to existing therapies, so there is thus a critical need to find novel cellular components that could be targeted to
block the pathological angiogenesis that is characteristic of these diseases. Ferrochelatase (FECH) is one
such component, necessary for proliferation of endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. FECH is responsible for
inserting ferrous ion into protoporphyrin IX, the final step in heme biosynthesis. The previous grant period
yielded findings that FECH is upregulated in murine and human choroidal and retinal neovascularization, that
FECH inhibition leads to depletion of hemoproteins in endothelial cells, and that FECH loss blocks heme-
dependent oxidative phosphorylation in endothelial cells. Reduced FECH activity also surprisingly blocks
glycolysis. In addition, the first drug-like FECH inhibitor, SH-17023 was developed and shown to be
antiangiogenic in vitro and in vivo. Building on this work, the current goal is to define the mechanism of how
heme synthesis through FECH and glycolysis impacts endothelial cell biology and neovascularization. The
rationale for this research is that FECH is a significant mediator of angiogenesis, a potential therapeutic target,
and a previously unappreciated regulator of the expression and function of glycolytic enzymes. The overall
hypothesis is that FECH, via controlling heme availability, is an integrated master regulator of multiple
proangiogenic pathways, including glycolysis. Guided by strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested
via two specific aims: 1. Delineate the mechanism of FECH’s influence on glycolysis and angiogenesis. The
glycolysis enzymes dysregulated by heme synthesis inhibition in endothelial cells and their heme-dependent
transcriptional regulation will be assessed in endothelial cells. Glycolytic function and related metabolic
pathways will be assessed by Seahorse, targeted metabolomics, and stable isotope tracing. The influence of
this heme-dependent glycolysis regulation on endothelial cell function will be determined, along with the cell-
type specificity of this effect. 2. Evaluate the first drug-like small molecule FECH inhibitor in ocular
neovascularization. The pharmacokinetics and toxicity of SH-17023 will be quantified. Then, this novel
molecule will be tested for efficacy in the oxygen-induced retinopathy, Vldlr-/-, and JR5558 retinal, subretinal,
and choroidal neovascularization models, plus synergy with anti-VEGF therapy. Overall, this work is
innovative, as it is the first mechanistic study of the links between heme synthesis, glycolysis, and posterior
ocular angiogenesis, and the first characterization of direct FECH inhibition with a drug-like small molecule for
retinal and choroidal neovascularization. The work is highly significant because it will comprehensively
elucidate linkages between heme metabolism and the process of glycolysis, not previously connected, and
establish FECH blockade as a viable therapy, leading to development of new ways to prevent blindness."

Adolescents are less likely to access prevention-oriented health services such as HIV

11014249,"Cancer health disparities remain in the US health care system. The incidence rate of liver cancer was 8
times in American Samoans and 2-3 times in Native Hawaiians compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHW)
(https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/). The underlying reasons for this large variation in liver cancer between Native
Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders (NHPI) and NHW are not completely understood. It is generally believed that
lifestyle factors, cultural barriers, and disparate exposures to carcinogens and pathogens may contribute to the
liver cancer disparities. In this supplemental grant application, we propose to expand our original cohort of
high-risk individuals for liver cancer in Western Pennsylvania, most of whom are NHW, to recruit and establish
a cohort of NHPI individuals at high risk for liver cancer, through an inter-institutional collaboration.
 The liver is an organ that is constantly exposed to a wide range of immunomodulators, environmental
toxins, and gut microbial metabolites through the portal vein. To ensure upkeep of immune tolerance to self
and foreign antigens, the liver has a unique immunotolerance mechanism. Heightened immunotolerance or
immune permissive microenvironment may create a setting with compromised immunosurveillance that
promotes the tumor development and growth in the liver. The gut microbiota can produce large quantities of
metabolites such as secondary bile acids that have genotoxic and tumor-promoting effect. The gut dysbiosis
due to obesity and other metabolic diseases, which are underlying conditions for non-alcoholic fatty liver, alters
the metabolism, synthesis, and transport of bile acids, resulting in the change of bile acid pool size and
characteristics. The altered bile acids profile can elicit inflammation and cause liver injury, leading to fibrosis
and cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. We propose prospectively enroll at NHPI patients with
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. All study participants will be longitudinally followed up for the occurrence of
liver cancer and end-stage liver disease. The specific aims are to determine if immunosuppressive cytokines,
altered bile acid profiles, and the gut dysbiosis have significant impact on the risk of developing liver cancer
and end-stage liver disease. Furthermore, we will integrate these data with the similar study in NHW in
Western Pennsylvania and assess the differential associations for immunosuppressive cytokines, altered bile
acid profiles, and the gut dysbiosis with liver cancer risk between the two study cohorts. The findings, if prove
our hypotheses, will provide much needed scientific evidence for our understanding the liver cancer disparity
between NHPI and NHW populations. These finding will help develop effective and unique strategy for
management and surveillance for NHPI individuals at high risk for developing liver cancer and other end-stage
liver disease."

Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects have an estimated prevalence of 1-2 in 1,000 live births. The
22q11.2 deletion syndrome or 22q11.2DS is one of the most frequent genetic causes of cardiac OFT defects. A
total of 60% of patients with 22q11.2DS have congenital heart disease that ranges from mild to severe including
bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) to tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) or persistent
truncus arteriosus (PTA). These clinical findings suggest genetic modifiers may affect phenotypic expression
. In
this project, we propose to use the Lgdel/+ mouse model to understand the relationship between neural crest
cells (NCCs) and adjacent endocardial cells (ECCs) in forming and remodeling of the cardiac OFT.
Mesenchymal cells (MCs) derived from NCCs and ECCs occupy the distal and proximal OFT, respectively, and
form a distinct OFT MC boundary during heart development. Proper deployment of MCs from the two lineages
ensures correct position and formation of aorto-pulmonary-ventricular septum and semilunar valves to separate
the heart outlet into the systemic and pulmonary circulation. The function of NCCs in OFT defects has been well
studied with respect to 22q11.2DS, however, the role of ECCs in OFT malformations has not been investigated.
We have begun to fill this knowledge gap by studying the Lgdel/+ mouse, which was generated by deleting one
copy of the mouse syntenic region of human 22q11.2 containing 26 protein-coding genes (22q11.2DS genes).
We found a spectrum of OFT defects ranging from isolated VSD to TOF. The structural defects are preceded by
a disrupted OFT MC boundary, increased expression of Edn1 during endocardial-to-mesenchymal
transformation (EMT), and decreased NOTCH1 signaling and Ctgf expression during post-EMT OFT remodeling.
By single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we identified Edn1 as part of a unique gene program operating in
a subset of ECCs undergoing EMT. Based on these findings, we propose an overall hypothesis that 22q11.2DS
genes control OFT development by regulating the function of ECCs and the cell-cell communications between
MCs from ECC and NCC origins, via interacting with genes essential for OFT formation. We will test this
hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine whether the 22q11.2DS genes regulate EMT through
modulating the EMT gene program, and if Edn1 acts downstream of 22q11.2DS genes to regulate the process.
Aim 2 will ascertain whether 22q11.2DS genes also regulate OFT remodeling through a cell-cell interaction
network that patterns the OFT MC boundary, and if Ctgf functions as a hub gene required for the post-EMT OFT
remodeling, downstream of 22q11.2DS genes. Aim 3 will define whether Notch1 haploinsufficiency can
potentiate the 22q11.2DS OFT defects. At the completion of this study, we expect discoveries that will establish
genetic, molecular, and cell crosstalk regulated by important syndromic and non-syndromic CHD genes essential
for mouse OFT morphogenesis. The information will provide deeper understanding of heart developmental
biology and inform the disease mechanism of OFT defects, with a broader implication in congenital heart
disease."

We address calls for research that will inform paradigm-shifting interventions to address sexual
harassment and racialized mistreatment of advanced trainees in biomedical research training
environments (NOT-OD-21-150). Our approach is grounded in power-approach and moral
licensing theories which examines how personal embodiment of power in the context of structural
inequities mobilizes harassing and racist mistreatment of trainees. We conduct rigorous
experience sampling research to capture the effects of research mentors’ daily power
embodiment on mentees’ experiences of sexual harassment and related mistreatments to better
understand these linkages and exacerbating factors. We further develop a comprehensive
intervention, Indiana CARES (Creating Accountability and Building Relationships to Eradicate
Sexual Harassment), designed to break the links between power and harassment and change
the training environment climate and practices so that mentees can thrive. For Aim 1, 320 pairs
of mentor-mentees in biomedical research training programs will be solicited to participate in a
10-day daily survey study. Mentors will complete daily measures of their power embodiment,
affective states, and moral licensing cognitions. Mentees will complete evening measures of their
experiences of mistreatment by their mentors. Qualitative data on the nature of any mistreatment
they experience will be solicited. We further examine whether racial minority mentees are
particularly vulnerable to experiencing racialized sexual harassment, microaggression and
ostracism and we explore how structural characteristics, such as the relational demography
(race/gender matching) of mentor-mentee dyads, as well as the program’s tolerance for
harassment and mistreatment, as reported by mentees, affects these linkages. For Aim 2,
biomedical, research-active faculty at IUPUI and IUSM will be randomly assigned to a treatment
or control cohort. Our intervention consists of a four-part training program focusing on addressing
the role of power and moral licensing through perspective-taking and empathy training, followed
by a program-centered organizational change initiative supported by Program Enhancement
Grants (PEGs). Research will examine the impact of the training on breaking the power-
harassment link for mentors and improving their sensitivity to harassment and racial mistreatment.
Furthermore, our research will examine the impact of the full Indiana CARES intervention on
improving the climate for sexual harassment intolerance and increasing mentees’ sense of
belongingness and early career outcomes through reductions in harassment and racist
mistreatment. We replicate this program for the control cohort in the final year."

The purpose of this administrative supplement proposal is to expand the studies in our parent project
R03DE033541-01, Leveraging All of Us data to unravel the interconnectedness between dental and systemic
disease. In the parent project, we are conducting a large-scale study leveraging and integrating high-quality
clinical (dental and medical), genomic, and demographic data available from >250,000 participants in the All of
Us Research Program (AoU) to identify host factors most likely contributing to a combined phenotype of dental
+ systemic disease. For this administrative supplement, we propose to expand the above studies to include AoU
participant survey data and employ an intersectional approach incorporating analyses of lifestyle, health care
access and utilization, and other social determinants of health (SDOH), in order to identify the SDOH domains
most likely to intersect with the dental and systemic conditions being assessed on the parent project, with a focus
on women’s health. Several lines of evidence have shown that SDOH are linked to differences in prevalence of
oral and systemic disease and reduced opportunities for health and health-related quality of life, particularly in
women. However, there is a lack of studies integrating individual biological (e.g., genomic, sex at birth), and
nonbiological (e.g. SDOH) aspects thereby precluding our ability to understand the full spectrum of the common
causes and pathways of dental/systemic disease and their interactions as contributors to differential disease
predisposition or manifestation. Here, we will test the hypothesis that non-biological SDOH factors may intersect
with biological sex to influence disease predisposition and/or clinical manifestation. We will integrate SDOH data
available for the AoU participants that are being used in our parent project to the clinical and genomic data
obtained and apply a multidimensional analysis framework to explore the intersectional effects of biological and
non-biological (SDOH) factors and contributing to a combined phenotype of dental + systemic disease in males
and females. This study represents a major advance in the field by creating a roadmap for integrating clinical,
genomic, demographic and survey data from a large and diverse population in the AoU program to develop a
more comprehensive picture of the factors contributing to oral and systemic health/disease relationships between
the sexes. This proposal addresses the Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women’s Health Research goal #1

Over the last two decades there has been a dramatic increase in the number and expansion in the
geographic range of Lyme disease cases. These are likely caused by increasing temperature's effect
on populations of the Lyme disease vector, the blacklegged tick. With expected continued warming and
climate change, the geographic range of the blacklegged tick and Lyme disease should continue to
change. We need better tools to map the current range of blacklegged tick populations and to forecast
future range shifts and year-to-year variations. The development of these tools is hampered by the fact
that blacklegged ticks respond to stochastic extreme weather events, while models of tick populations
are based on deterministic climate averages. In Aim 1 we will first address this limitation by conducting
a series of observations in the field to understand how weather variation and extremes affect life history
processes of the blacklegged tick. We will use two types of tick enclosures to monitor tick host-seeking
behavior and tick survival. At the same time, we will track temperature and relative humidity in the leaf
litter, which is the microclimate that tick's experience. In Aim 2 we will develop a novel tick population
model that will be encoded with the results of Aim 1. It will predict how tick populations respond to
continuous weather fluctuations rather than just mean climate. This new tool has a stochastic structure
so that it can predict how rare events could lead to population bottlenecks or local extinctions. Such a
structure is typically very computationally intensive, but we have developed a novel approach which
can switch between computationally-intensive, exact population modeling and a computationally-cheap
average approximation when necessary. This model will be validated by hindcasting to existing
blacklegged and Lyme disease distribution data, and then used to predict future distribution with climate
change projections. The code for the model will be shared, as the approach is useful to modeling other
arthropod vectors as well."

Significance: Cerebral edema develops in a large percentage of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases and
may lead to worsened morbidity. The importance of osmotic gradients as the cause of edema has been
described. Published reports indicate cerebral edema remains refractory in many patients to all currently
available treatments. Translational research has identified reversal of the osmotic gradient as a requirement
for treating cerebral edema; therefore, there is a critical need for new cerebral edema therapies to manage
both osmotic and hydrostatic pressure gradients.
Innovation: Reductive Ventricular OsmoTherapy (RVOT) manages osmotic pressure gradients by removing
free water from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain ventricles. CSF water is removed by pervaporation
through embedded hollow fiber membranes, as a dry air sweep gas removes water vapor. Increased
ventricular osmotic pressure then causes water movement out of the tissue and into the ventricles where it is
removed by the RVOT catheter by either continued pervaporation or a hydrostatic bulk drainage mechanism.
Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is ventricular osmotherapy will reduce cerebral edema by hydrostatic and osmotic
mechanisms, and thereby provide a safe and efficacious aid to improve TBI management.
Preliminary Data: This hypothesis is based on published preliminary data with a large animal experimental
TBI study demonstrating that RVOT can significantly increase CSF osmolality. RVOT treatment resulted in
improved Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and other evidence of reduced cerebral edema.
Expected Impact: RVOT will provide clinicians a new tool in combination with current and future interventions
to improve TBI patient outcomes.
SBIR Phase I: Obtain clinical study approval with pre-clinical test data.
SBIR Phase II: Assess RVOT clinical safety and efficacy as an ICP management aid device. Phase 1 First-
In-Human Safety Study: Enroll 10 severe TBI patients with insertion and management of RVOT catheter to
assess safety as primary endpoint. Phase 2a Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial: Enroll 40 severe TBI
patients randomized 3:1 to RVOT (n=30) or standard-of-care external ventricular drain (n=10) therapy to
assess RVOT safety, efficacy and economic feasibility endpoints, with the overall objective of enabling an
SBIR Phase III pivotal study to obtain market authorization and RVOT System product commercial launch.
Commercialization Plan: This SBIR Fast Track project offers a highly credible commercialization pathway
based on a significant unmet medical need supported with a large animal feasibility study, corporate partner
prospects, and experienced neurotrauma device, clinical, and commercial team."

 Sepsis affects more than 19 million people each year. With improved treatment strategies, more and more
patients survive sepsis. The majority of these survivors develop cognitive impairment and mental health
problems. However, the mechanisms that promote sepsis-associated encephalopathies (SAE) remain largely
unknown, and there is a lack of SAE-targeted treatments. The long-term goals of our research program are to
understand the mechanisms that lead to cerebrovascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment post sepsis and
to develop novel targeted treatments for sepsis-induced cognitive impairment. To reach this goal, we
characterized sepsis-induced cognitive impairment using animal models. We observed that mice exhibit
hippocampus-dependent memory impairment associated with pathological neuron dysfunction. To understand
the mechanisms behind cognitive impairment post sepsis, we focused on specialized cells in the brain called
pericytes, which play a major role in regulating cerebral blood flow and maintaining blood brain barrier integrity.
Pericytes form part of the neurovascular unit to meet the energy demands of the brain and facilitate neuro-
inflammatory responses. However, the role of pericytes in sepsis-induced cognitive impairment remains
unknown. Our studies demonstrated that the transcription factor friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1)
regulates pericyte activation and viability. We also observed that brain pericyte numbers decreased after sepsis
and that pericytes underwent apoptosis after their initial activation and production of inflammatory mediators.
Pericyte loss resulted in vascular leakage and recruitment of inflammatory monocytes. We reported previously
that Fli-1 governs pericyte viability through regulating caspase 1/3 expression. In our preliminary studies, we
demonstrated that pericyte Fli-1 knockout mice exhibit decreased inflammatory mediator production in response
to LPS. More importantly, we demonstrated that Fli-1 levels were higher in the hippocampus regions of post-
mortem brain tissue from septic patients compared to controls. In this R35/MIRA application, we propose to use
newly developed, unbiased approaches such as single nucleus RNA sequencing and imaging mass cytometry
alongside inducible pericyte-specific Fli-1 knockout mice generated in our laboratory and novel antisense
oligonucleotide Gapmers targeting Fli-1 recently developed by our group to understand the role of pericytes in
vascular dysfunction and cognitive impairment post sepsis. The successful completion of the proposed studies
will lead to better understanding of the mechanisms of vascular cognitive impairment post sepsis and the
development of novel SAE-targeted treatments."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The Neuroscience Colorado Research Experience (N-CORE) is a summer internship and educational
program that gives undergraduate students from historically underrepresented backgrounds (URM) authentic
neuroscience research experiences in state-of-the-art biomedical research labs at the University of Colorado
Anschutz Medical School Campus (CU Anschutz). N-CORE's overarching goal is to cultivate a better
understanding of neuroscience and biomedical research, engender scientific enthusiasm, and promote
retention in scientific fields. N-CORE accomplishes this through a summer program that combines high-
quality mentored research experiences, educational programming, professional development opportunities,
and longitudinal mentoring. N-CORE interns receive instruction on core neuroscience concepts, scientific
rigor and reproducibility, scientific communication, and professional development. At the end of the summer
internship, all interns present their research at a campus-wide Undergraduate Research Symposium.
Emphasis will be placed on ensuring an inclusive environment that fosters diversity in education and research
and all Program faculty mentors will receive training in mentoring diverse students. After the internship, intern
alumni are automatically enrolled in our Pre-doctoral Mentorship Program, where they will receive customized
guidance on profession development and career opportunities. N-CORE brings together the expertise,
enthusiasm, and institutional support to succeed in its goals. The N-CORE Program Directors bring over a
decade of experience in managing a summer research program for URM undergraduate students and have
built a strong alliance with the CU Anschutz Neuroscience Graduate Program (NGP), an NIH-supported T32
training program. Critically, N-CORE also brings on-board NGP graduate and MD/PhD students in the
leadership and operations of N-CORE. These students will help interns quickly integrate into the CU
Anschutz research community. In this proposal, we seek to build on our collective past successes and
expertise to create a well-supported, sustainable summer research experience program for URM
undergraduate students that will foster a better understanding of neuroscientific biomedical and clinical
research and build a community for like-minded individuals interested in continuing along a scientific or
medical career path."
11021585,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this K01 award is to provide Gina Tripicchio, PhD, MSEd, with the training and mentorship
to establish an independent program of research focused on innovative behavioral interventions to improve
dietary intake in high-risk adolescents. Added sugar (AS) is a prime target for dietary intervention in
adolescents; it contributes excess calories with no nutritional benefits, and adolescents consume more AS than
any other age group. High-risk adolescents (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities from low-income communities),
experience disproportionately higher rates of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases yet remain
understudied. A key limitation in developing efficacious trials for this high-risk group is the dearth of information
about key factors associated with AS intake. To address this gap, this project aims to characterize key drivers
of AS intake in high-risk adolescents using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA allows for the
examination of contextually specific dietary influences in real-time, while reducing recall bias and participant
burden. This rich information can be used to guide the development of a tailored, salient behavioral
intervention. Additionally, an objective carbon stable isotope ratio (CIR) biomarker of AS has recently emerged
and can be used to address key limitations of self-reported outcomes in dietary interventions. Two studies will
be employed to meet the aims of this project. Study 1 (years 1-2), will collect EMA from 40 adolescents and
examine the feasibility and acceptability of the CIR biomarker in the target sample. Study 2 (years 3-5), will
implement a pilot RCT to test a contextually tailored, technology-enriched intervention in a sample of 70
adolescents, 12-16 years of age, from a low-income community in north Philadelphia. A 3-month behavioral
intervention, including group-based sessions, interactive text messaging and parent support, will aim to reduce
AS intake compared to an educational comparison group. Changes in AS, as measured by the CIR biomarker,
will be assessed as the primary outcome and total changes in diet quality will be examined as a secondary
outcome. A rigorous training plan complements the proposed research and is facilitated by mentors who are
experts in nutrition, eating behavior, digital interventions, statistics, and behavioral trials in pediatric
populations. Specific training objectives include: 1) ecological momentary assessment, 2) multi-level statistical
modeling, 3) assessment of objective nutritional biomarkers and 4) designing and implementing behavioral
interventions to address disparities. Temple University's Center for Obesity Research and Education is an ideal
setting for this work as it provides extensive research resources and access to a population of diverse, high-
risk youth. This award holds significant potential for public health impact and will enable Dr. Tripicchio to
establish a rigorous program of research to improve dietary intake and reduce diet-related chronic disease risk
in vulnerable adolescents. This K01 Administrative Supplement will ensure Dr. Tripicchio's progress to date is
not disrupted due to a critical life event and will facilitate her clear trajectory towards research independence."
11012024,"American Indians/Alaska Natives (AIAN) are disproportionately impacted by the burden of cancer. Compared
to other racial and ethnic groups in the United States (US), AIAN individuals face higher rates of many cancers,
later stages at diagnosis, worse outcomes after diagnosis, and lower rates of cancer survival. The Partnership
for Native American Cancer Prevention (NACP), a 21-year collaboration between Northern Arizona University
(NAU) and the University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC), has made impactful strides that successfully
address the causal factors that drive AIAN cancer inequities. NACP has had a significant positive impact on
the pipeline of AIAN individuals seeking careers related to cancer health research, including the training of
Native investigators poised to be leaders in this field. NACP has been a driver of institutional change at both
NAU and UACC by fostering an increase in cancer research capacity at NAU and health disparity-focused
research at UACC and by elevating both institutions’ commitments to serving AIAN students and communities.
NACP has built a strong foundation of relationships with tribal communities, governments, and other partners,
based on trust and respect, and this is resulting in an acceleration of the positive impacts driven by NACP’s
activities, both present and future. NACP is poised to realize past investments while sustaining current
relationships and expanding interactions to additional tribal communities in Arizona. The NACP remains
committed to its core goals of reducing the burden of cancer within AIAN populations through research and
community engagement, growing the number of AIAN investigators participating in the cancer research
workforce, and increasing the total number of investigators focused on cancer health disparities within Native
Arizona communities. While these overall goals remain consistent, NACP is introducing an operational
framework to systematically incorporate Indigenous perspectives as a core reference to guide and thread
together its work. NACP will embrace the ‘two-eyed seeing’ paradigm, which seeks to “see from one eye with
the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of
Western knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both of these eyes together for the benefit of all.”
Aim 1. To engage in bidirectional communication grounded in the principle of reciprocity with our AIAN
community partners to promote best practices with respect to cancer health and to develop research priorities
and programs that address AI cancer health disparities.
Aim 2. To grow the pipeline of cancer-focused Indigenous researchers and health care professionals through
educational and training programs tailored to high school, undergraduates, graduate students, junior
investigators, and early-stage investigators.
Aim 3. Conduct impactful cancer disparity focused research that is informed by and inclusive of tribal
community priorities and concerns."
11012031,"Disparities in educational attainment are more pronounced at each successive level, with 0.4% AIAN
enrollment in graduate STEM programs in 2021.2 Consequently, most scientists and health professionals
working with tribal communities are not representative of the communities they serve. The Partnership for
Native American Cancer Prevention (NACP) Research Education Core (REC) is actively improving this
landscape. By cycle 3, we showed evidence of AIAN trainees transitioning to graduate programs. Most
recently, cycle 4 trainees who were undergraduates in cycles 1 and 2 advanced to post-doctoral fellowships,
faculty positions, and clinician roles. We have also expanded our capacity to train more undergraduates
(N=146) in the current cycle and accelerated degree attainment; 73 graduate degrees were completed by
AIAN students in this cycle alone. The number of doctoral degrees attained now exceeds that of the prior 3
cycles combined. Thus, NACP has positioned our institutions as national leaders in AIAN education. NAU
leads the nation in undergraduate Public Health degrees and UA leads the nation in AIAN conferred doctoral
degrees.3-5 These successes are due in large part to the innovative approach to training embedded in
indigenous perspectives that we have honed with our AIAN faculty, students, and Community Advisory Board
(CAB). We have demonstrated that wrap-around support of students, including a “web” of mentors and
activities provides a culturally appropriate and highly effective environment for recruiting and retaining AIAN
students.6 Activities focus on enhancing students’ research skills by providing curricular programming and
hands-on mentored cancer research, complemented by career development planning and a wide range of role
models at both institutions. This mature REC program will expand across the Four Corners Region (AZ, CO,
UT, NM) to allow us to share more broadly our training and mentoring approach and increase the network for
student placement. We will embrace the two-eyed seeing paradigm as we expand the web of support which
will allow us to “see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from
the other eye with the strengths of Western knowledges and ways of knowing”.7
Aim 1. Provide two-eyed seeing research education to diversify the workforce and improve the
capacity of UACC and NAU to develop AIAN cancer disparities research.
Aim 2. Increase AIAN student progression to graduate degrees and cancer-related careers by
providing uniquely integrated career development, mentorship, and networking activities.
Aim 3. Increase reach of the novel AIAN cancer health disparities research education and career
development program by establishing partnerships with AIAN serving colleges/universities and
Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the Four Corners Region."
11031074,"Summary of Supplement Project
This diversity supplement to parent grant R01DC020965 “Naturalistic Neuroimaging for Presurgical Language
Mapping” (Tie, Liebenthal, PIs) seeks two years of support for graduate student Manuel Marte.
Mr. Marte is a PhD candidate in the Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences program at Boston University (BU)
and a certified speech-language pathologist with a strong clinical foundation in neuropsychological assessment
of individuals with aphasia with broad training on innovative behavioral research methods in communication
disorders. His long-term career goal is to become an academic researcher specializing in naturalistic approaches
for quantitative assessment and intervention in monolingual and bilingual persons with aphasia. Mr. Marte is of
Hispanic descent and as such, his professional and cultural backgrounds make him ideally suited for an
academic career focused on studying bilingual aphasia, and broadly, aphasia in all individuals.
The activities proposed under the supplement consist of hands-on training in naturalistic methods for aphasia
research. Mr. Marte will spearhead the development of a cutting-edge paradigm using emotional reactivity to
movie clips as a lens for assessing language capacity in aphasia. He will master state-of-the-art neuroscientific
data collection and analysis methodologies, including eye-tracking, functional MRI, and brain-lesion mapping.
He will acquaint himself with language assessment in persons with aphasia resulting from a brain tumor. The
specialized training and participation in pioneering research will lay for the applicant a robust foundation on which
to develop an independent research program.
The research activities under this supplement augment the parent grant’s Aim 1 by adding objective behavioral
(emotional reactivity) and physiological (eye gaze, fMRI) measures of language engagement to test the same
primary hypothesis, namely that language performance in individuals with aphasia will be comparable or superior
for movie-watching versus conventional language paradigms. The measures added in the supplement will be
conducted with the participants of the parent grant’s Aim 1, and do not change the risk to these participants.
Proposed for a two-year duration starting 03/15/2024, this supplement aligns with Mr. Marte’s academic timeline
(expected graduation in 02/26) and the parent grant's active period (expected until April 2028). A salient
milestone in his training trajectory includes his intent to apply for an NIH grant, such as the F32 postdoctoral
diversity fellowship grant."
11031104,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) proposes to renew the existing summer research experience in neurobiology and
continue to support a focused neurobiology cohort within the existing JAX Summer Student Program, an
internationally recognized research education program for undergraduates and high school students. Under the
proposed renewal, six undergraduate students will conduct neurobiology research in the labs of 11 NIHfunded
neuroscientists who lead cutting-edge, collaborative research programs in Alzheimer’s disease, peripheral
neuropathies, motor neuron degeneration, synaptic development, retinal disease and glaucoma, addiction, Rett
syndrome, and sensory disorders. The 10-week residential internship will provide each participant a summer
salary and funds to support student research supplies and travel to national meetings to present findings. The
proposed program will offer an intense research internship in neurobiology with a focus on the laboratory mouse
as an investigative tool to probe the basic mechanisms of human biology and disease. As a member of the
mentor’s laboratory team, each student will design and conduct an independent, hypothesis-driven project using
advanced analysis methods and tools and the outstanding genetic resources available at JAX. The defined
research education curriculum will include asynchronous online learning modules, bioinformatics bootcamps,
workshops on the ethical conduct of research within historical and modern scientific contexts, and science
communication. JAX institutional commitment includes student access to intellectual and research resources
such as on-campus courses and conferences, state-of-the-art instrumentation and bioinformatics databases,
dedicated program direction by JAX Genomic Education, and a staffed on-campus residential program. The
neurobiology cohort will join the Summer Student Program, which is supported by institutional funds, private
foundations, and federal grants, and has well-established administrative procedures for recruitment and
selection, mentor training and support, and program design, management, and evaluation. The program will
identify participants through a national recruitment and competitive application process. JAX will recruit students
underrepresented in biomedicine through targeted outreach and partnerships. JAX offers a stimulating
environment in which motivated, talented students from diverse backgrounds can learn the fundamentals of
scientific inquiry, contribute to real research progress, and make great strides in intellectual and personal growth
that will guide them toward a career in research."
11031167,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
To survive, animals must learn appropriate associations between sensory cues and motor actions through a
process of trial and error. We expect that this learning will strengthen the synaptic connections between
neurons representing the sensory cue and neurons initiating the motor action. The strengthened synapses may
be direct synaptic connections between these neuronal populations or via systems intermediate between these
neurons, i.e., a “plastic brain circuit” or “pathway.” Synaptic plasticity has been observed in many different brain
areas, and the mechanisms are moderately well understood. However, we have struggled to identify which
plastic brain circuit underlies, specifically, the sensory cue-to-motor action association that is learned through
the process of trial and error. This is due, in part, to the fact that many brain areas undergo plastic changes
during learning, as the experience of learning recruits a variety of different cognitive processes, including
sensory detection, motor control, feedback, working memory and reinforcement learning -- cognitive processes
that all engage different brain areas and distributed networks. During my postdoc, I developed an approach to
assign these cognitive functions to different brain circuits for a case of trial and error learning in mice. The
approach involved an innovative behavior paradigm and optogenetic tools that are spatially and temporally
precise. Mice learned to associate the optogenetic activation of visual cortex (cue) with a forelimb reach to
grab a food pellet (motor action). As a result of my postdoc work, I now know which neurons in the brain
encode this cue and which are required to initiate this motor action. Therefore I am now equipped to identify
the plastic brain circuit underlying the learned association between this cue and this action. Here I propose to
study the brain circuit between the cue-encoding neurons and the neurons necessary to initiate the motor
action, in vivo while mice learn the cue-action association. I will study the flow of neural activity from the cue-
encoding neurons in the visual cortex to the neurons in the superior colliculus that are necessary to initiate the
motor action. In Aim 1, I will identify changes in the cued activity in visual cortex over learning. In Aim 2, I will
determine how activity in the superior colliculus changes over learning. In Aim 3, I will determine whether the
output of this pathway is sufficient to trigger the motor action after learning. Hence this work speaks directly to
a key goal of the Brain Initiative, to “demonstrate causal links between brain activity and behavior.” I will learn
in vivo two-photon imaging for Aim 1 under the guidance of Dr. Sabatini, an expert at this technique. Aims 2
and 3 will be conducted in the independent phase using in vivo electrophysiology, a technique with which I
have extensive experience. These experiments will help to identify a pathway from visual cortex to superior
colliculus that stores a learned, associative memory. Finding the neural basis of learned, sensory cue-motor
action associations will be essential to treat specific harmful associations, such as occur in PTSD, OCD,
autism and anxiety, without generally disrupting sensory or motor behavior."
11011961,"Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality for Native Americans.1 In Arizona (AZ), only the Navajo
Nation and the Hopi Tribe have Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding through the National
Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program to provide breast and cervical cancer screening and
diagnostic services. The San Carlos Apache Tribe and the Tohono O’odham Nation use tribal funds to provide
cancer education. Despite the overwhelming need for cancer related services and the Partnership for Native
American Cancer Prevention’s (NACP) accomplishments in building program capacity, the remaining 18 of the
22 AZ Native Nations have no sustained cancer support programs or trained patient navigators to promote
screening, explain treatment options and support cancer patients and their families. This persistent gap is
linked to challenges in securing external funding and limited availability of patient navigation training specific to
Native American clients. In collaboration with tribes, NACP is well positioned to build on the expertise of the
Hopi Tribe and Navajo Nation to enhance capacity among other AZ Native communities ready for robust
cancer control programming to address structural and individual barriers to cancer care.
 The Outreach and Engagement Core’s (OEC) long-term goal is to strengthen AZ Native Nations’ capacity
and infrastructure to provide sustained, community-based cancer education, screening and care services to
advance cancer health equity. In the next cycle, OEC will continue integrating Indigenous and non-Indigenous
worldviews to leverage community assets to address community needs, an approach being adopted
throughout NACP called the two-eyed seeing approach.6 The objectives of the Core’s proposal are to: a)
enhance tribal health department expertise in cancer education and patient navigation through training, inter-
tribal, peer-program mentoring, and program development, and b) increase access to and application of
information generated by NACP funded research projects, as well as state and national resources. A guiding
principle of the OEC is collaboration, specifically the continuation and expansion of partnerships with
institutional partners, Native Nations and Native American-serving entities to build regional capacity through
coalition building, supporting tribes’ own efforts to bring cancer related services to their citizens, and mentoring
NACP investigative teams to disseminate relevant research results to Native Nations.
Aim 1. Enhance AZ Native Nations’ cancer patient navigation capacity through CHR training and
mentorship across the cancer care continuum.
Aim 2: Facilitate a national Intertribal cancer network to build programmatic knowledge, funding, and
infrastructure for AZ’s tribal cancer related activities.
Aim 3. Mentor and guide NACP research teams in effective community-based dissemination and
application of research activities through enhanced training."
11011996,"Project summary
Eukaryotic bHLH/PAS (basic helix-loop-helix/Per-ARNT-Sim) transcription factors play a critical role in regulating
cellular responses to hypoxia, xenobiotic compounds, and several other environmental conditions. Deregulation
of these pathways is highly correlated with several forms of cancer, including solid tumor onset and progression,
as best exhibited by links between overexpression of HIF (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) isoforms and predisposition
to kidney cancers. The PAS domains within these transcription factors are attractive targets for small molecule
regulation given the role that these domains play as cofactor-regulated protein/protein interaction domains in a
wide range of sensory proteins throughout biology. Here we propose to combine the complementary strengths
of the Gardner lab (CCNY) and Tan lab (MSK) for a multi-pronged attack on studying the structure and artificial
regulation of interactions between ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon nuclear receptor translocator), a common element of
several bHLH/PAS heterodimeric complexes, and several coactivator proteins that are essential for ARNT
function. Preliminary data strongly support the feasibility of this project, including cryoEM and other biophysical
data on several ARNT complexes and moderate potency small-molecule inhibitors of ARNT/CCC interactions.
Coupled with the expertise of the two groups with the requisite assays and methods, plus their past experience
in comparable projects, there is substantial confidence in this project catalyzing interactions between the two
labs and developing novel routes for small molecule regulation of cancer-driving transcription factors using an
integrated strategy of structural, chemical, and cellular research approaches.
Relevance
We propose to combine the expertise in the Gardner and Tan labs in structural biology, biochemistry, and
synthetic organic chemistry to characterize and inhibit interactions between the ARNT transcriptional regulator
and a series of coactivator proteins. Misregulation of ARNT-containing complexes are correlated with a variety
of cancers; results from our work will both guide understanding of how such complexes are assembled and guide
development of small molecule tool compounds to control their formation."
11011997,"Project Summary: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), widely used in cancer treatment, are associated with
the development of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, referred to as immune-related adverse events
(irAEs), affecting up to 40-60% of those treated. IrAEs result in additional patient morbidity, decreased quality
of life, treatment stoppage, and increased mortality. Furthermore, outcomes in minoritized populations often
tend to be worse. Identifying individuals at poorest irAE outcome risk, and the underlying reasons, is critical for
pretherapy counseling, tailoring supportive care interventions, and potentially treating with alternate anticancer
regimens. Factors known to influence the development of irAEs include increased age, female gender, pre-
existing autoimmune disease, ICI targets, genetic factors (HLA-DRB), and pretherapy eosinophil and B cell
levels. However, there is limited understanding on the interplay of biologic factors, along with allostatic load and
social determinants of health (SDoH), in irAE immunobiology and patient outcomes, and little data on
interventions to mitigate irAE impact in minoritized and/or low socioeconomic status (SES) populations.
Cutaneous irAEs (ircAEs) provide a unique platform for irAE studies: they are the most common irAEs, are
often a precursor to other-organ-specific irAEs, and skin tissue is accessible for study. Thus, I CARE will focus
on ircAEs. I CARE will use biologic specimens from the U01 AR077511 (Identification of Pathways to Mitigate
Immune- Related Adverse Events with Cancer Immunotherapy; PIs: Leung, Lacouture, Kern) patient cohort, to
be diversified with additional enrollees, to further describe the immunobiology of ircAEs (Aim 1), and the
association of SDoH, allostatic load, and symptom severity (Aim 2). These data will then be used to inform the
implementation of an intensive patient navigation/side effects management intervention, to be tested in a 2-arm
pilot randomized controlled trial (versus usual and customary care), for its impact at 6 months on ICI continuation
(primary outcome); side effect occurrence, severity, and management; quality of life; and biological changes
(secondary outcomes) in a cohort of minoritized and/or low SES cancer patients receiving ICIs (Aim 3). The I
CARE study personnel will work with the U54 Linguistic & Cultural Responsiveness Shared Resource and
Community Outreach and Research Engagement cores to facilitate participant engagement
Relevance: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are immunotherapy drugs that treat various types of cancer, but up
to half of patients have adverse events from taking these drugs, with the result that they discontinue the drug
early, and may have worse quality of life or even shorter life expectancy. This study investigates whether these
adverse events are more likely to happen in patients from minoritized or poorer populations due to increased
life stress – and if so, what are the specific factors involved, to address this problem."
11012001,"Research Education Core
Since the inception of the CCNY-MSK U54 in 2008, we have developed and implemented approaches to engage
and mentor students and early-stage investigators in cancer research. We have provided undergraduate and
graduate students with hands-on research experiences, developed cancer-related curricula, engaged students
in hands-on research experiences, and provided professional socialization and mentorship for students
appropriate to their academic level and career interests. We also provide individualized resources to ensure the
success of our ESIs and monitor their progress. The majority of students at CCNY, come from underrepresented
and underserved communities, and are socioeconomically disadvantaged. Many of our students are also first-
generation college students and/or from immigrant families and face immense competing demands that may
prevent them from choosing research careers. Our program is designed to provide opportunities for them to
successfully conduct biomedical and behavioral research at CCNY and MSK, and to provide mentorship and
guidance for career decision-making. Our overall goals are to: 1) Increase the number of competitively
trained, underrepresented students who enroll in MD, PhD or MD/PhD programs and, specifically, 2)
Increase the numbers of these students who pursue cancer-related research careers, and 3) Increase
the research competitiveness of Partnership ESIs. We will accomplish these goals by: (a) Providing
experiential activities and opportunities, support services and Partnership activities to enhance students’
engagement and performance in cancer-related research and professions; (b) Providing academic counseling,
advisement and mentoring to students to ensure that they are aware of the opportunities and prerequisites for
careers in cancer research; (c) Providing translational research experiences for each student prior to
graduation; (d) Providing career development resources for, and closely monitoring the progress of, ESIs; (e)
Conducting an evaluation to determine the results of all program activities and resource utilization; (f) Developing
and submitting proposals, e.g., through R25 mechanisms, to enrich th e sustainability of our educational and
training initiatives. In the next funding cycle, we will initiate new curricula with the Partnership Community
Outreach, Research, and Education/Engagement Core (PCORE) and the Linguistic and Cultural
Responsiveness Shared Resource Core (LCRSRC), which includes: 1) a Minor/Major in Medical Interpretation
and Translation in the Classical and Modern Languages and Literatures Department, 2) a Minor and Masters in
Health Equity in the Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership, and 3) training for undergraduate and
master’s students in data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in the Grove School of
Engineering. These new initiatives will build a didactic, institutionalized platform for trainees to develop the
knowledge and research skills to address translational cancer health disparities and health equity."

Center, NYC H+H [municipal healthcare system], Federally Qualified Health Centers [FQHCs], MSK Ralph
Lauren Center [RLC]), and the reach of the Mobile Health Unit to expand the capacity to provide additional at-
risk communities with cancer disparities reduction activities; and c) Support and collaborate with the U54
Partnership Cores, including the Linguistic and Cultural Responsiveness Shared Resource and Research
Education Cores, and with the U54 Working Groups and the MSK P30 CCSG to engage low socioeconomic
status, LEP, and other underserved health disparity populations, and CCNY and MSK researchers, to maximize
bidirectional knowledge exchange, develop best practices, impact policy, and engage the community in
targeted programs and studies. AIM 2. To leverage the expanded infrastructure developed in Aim 1 to further
develop, implement, and disseminate robust i) community-engaged cancer disparities reduction outreach,
education, research, and comprehensive screening packages that include precision prevention/precision
medicine, and patient navigation into and through care; and ii) policy development to address socioeconomic
determinants of cancer outcomes, changes in screening guidelines with evolving evidence, and disparities in
priority areas guided by community needs assessments and the NCI National Cancer Plan: a) Precision
prevention (e.g. genetic ancestry, genetic screening)/precision medicine (e.g. immunotherapy, liquid biopsies,
cancer genomics, targeted therapies) programs and research; b) Prevention-risk reduction (tobacco, obesity,

diagnostics is a major driver for the development of new technologies. Among the biological species that may
be exploited along these lines, exosomes are particularly promising. Exosomes are small (30–130 nm)
extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from all cell types within the body, which are now realized as key agents in
intracellular communication. They exhibit protein biomarkers from their cells of origin, making them promising
candidates for use in disease diagnostics. Likewise, much interest lies in the potential use of exosomes as
drug delivery vehicles (i.e., vectors). However, a great deal of fundamental research is necessary before the
utility of exosomes is fully realized. A crucial challenge in the application of exosome-based research and
application lies in the lack of robust and versatile methods for vesicle isolation from diverse biological media.
While isolation and quantification methods have evolved, none have overcome the key issues associated with
rigor and reproducibility to cleanly, quickly, and cost-effectively isolate exosomes. To address this void, an
extremely efficient platform technology for exosome capture and isolation, based on novel poly(ethylene-
terephthalate) (PET) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers and films, is being developed for applications
across the scales of relevance for basic research, clinical diagnostics, and preparative recovery. Initial results
show that the fibers can effectively isolate extracellular vesicles, enriched in exosomes, with size distributions
and yields comparable to traditional isolation methods, in much shorter times, smaller volume scales, and
higher purity. Proposed here is the further development and validation of this exosome isolation methodology
for fundamental research and clinical laboratories, with extension to the preparative-scale for vector
applications. As dictated by the objectives of this program, and as demanded by the collective “exosome
community”, the ultimate objective of the effort is the delivery of working prototypes for evaluation by scientific
peers and potential commercial providers. The Research and Development program is pursued across three
Specific Aims. In the first, highly permeable chromatography columns created from unique-shaped fibers
provide a platform for isolation and purification of exosomes amenable to applications on the clinical, research,
and preparative scales, superior to current exosome isolation methodologies. In the second, implementation of
the fibers in spin-down tip format provides greater versatility towards generic- and targeted-exosome
harvesting using common, bench-top centrifuges. In the third, C-CP fiber films can be configured to affect a
high-efficiency, multiplexed lateral flow immunoassay for clinical diagnostics. It is fully believed that the results
of this program will demonstrate that novel C-CP fiber/film isolation platforms will prove to be an efficient, cost-
effective means to isolate exosomes for use in fundamental biochemistry research, clinical diagnostics, and
preparative applications, and that those characteristics will lead to commercial availability of the platfroms."

11031609,"ABSTRACT
The central goal of the Schumacher laboratory is to deduce principles governing fundamental biological
processes involving protein-nucleic acid interactions and their regulation, with a particular focus on processes
important in microbial pathogenesis. While we aim to elucidate these mechanisms at the atomic level, it is
critical that we are able to place our molecular findings within a biologically relevant context. Importantly, the
elucidation of such physiologically relevant mechanisms also provides molecular targets for the development of
antimicrobial agents, which are urgently needed; recent estimates suggest that deaths from antimicrobial
resistance (AMR) bacteria may exceed 10 million deaths worldwide by 2050 if steps are not taken to generate
new treatments. Microbes must be able to sense and respond to environmental changes for their survival and
in some cases, proper development. Hence, our studies focus on essential processes in which environmental
cues are signaled and detected. Recent studies have shown that the metabolic state of bacteria influences
their susceptibility to antibiotics and that antibiotic efficacy can be enhanced by altering the metabolic state of
bacteria. A main area of interest in the lab has been elucidating the mechanisms by which essential elements,
such as nitrogen, are sensed and regulated in microbes. The central enzyme in nitrogen homeostasis is
glutamine synthetase (GS), which catalyzes the assimilation of ammonium ions into glutamine, and thus
serves as the major nitrogen donor for the generation of all key metabolites. Using a combination of cryo-EM,
X-ray crystallography, biochemistry and in vivo studies, we have dissected the GS-GlnR signaling pathway in
bacteria and uncovered a novel mechanism of dual regulation involving altered oligomerization of both
proteins. We term this form of regulation, “oligomer modulation”. We have gone on to show that oligomer
modulation may, in fact, be a commonly used mode of GS regulation. Specifically, we found that the
Methanosarcina mazei (Mm) GS, which forms a large dodecameric machine at high concentrations, is present
as inactive dimers at physiologically relevant concentrations. This mechanism was suggested by our structural
studies, which were performed at high concentrations. However, mass photometry (MP) permitted an analysis
of the GS oligomer state at physiological levels. This study thus shows the power of MP in placing our
structural findings within a biological framework. MP could be utilized in all our studies to assess complexes
and oligomers and as a result to aid in the development of biologically relevant macromolecular models that
can be targeted for drug development."
11031616,"Administrative Supplement to Purchase Thermocycler Instruments
ABSTRACT
This supplement requests replacement of thermocycler equipment to support research funded through
NIGMS grant R35 GM122532 (PI: Weeks). Our research program is focused on using genomics methods to
understand the structure, function and ligandability of RNA secondary and tertiary structures. Methods and
technologies invented in our laboratory are extensively adopted by research labs and biotechnology
companies worldwide. RNA genomics methods ultimately all rely on massively parallel sequencing for their
readout, and library preparation for sequencing requires multiple PCR or RT-PCR steps. Two of our
thermocyclers have recently broken and are unrepairable, severely compromising our workflow.
Procurement of these replacement instruments is essential to accomplish the core aims of the parent
project, will accelerate biomedical research, and will enhance sustained biomedical impact by the Weeks
laboratory."

The NIMHD funded parent project, R01 MD015395, “Social Factors, Epigenomics, and Lupus in African
American women (SELA)” seeks to identify the epigenetic mechanisms by which positive and negative social
experiences, such as social support and racial discrimination, affect gene function and thereby influence
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; lupus) in African American (AA) women. SLE is a prototypic autoimmune
disease marked by a disproportionate prevalence and severity burden in AA women. AAs experience a
disproportionate burden of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and adverse outcomes including death. Less is
known about long-term outcomes of COVID-19 and long COVID symptoms in SLE, although it is thought that
COVID-19 infection may further complicate disparities. Moreover, social determinants of health (SDOH)
influence SLE outcomes. Our long-term goal is to understand how the intersection of multiple biological,
behavioral, and sociocultural exposures contribute to lupus outcomes in AA women with SLE. Our specific
objective is to understand the long-term clinical impact of COVID-19 infection in this health disparity population.
In direct response to NOT-OD-24-032, the goal of this Administrative Supplement is to capitalize on the parent
grant’s research infrastructure to expand it to include additional individual and community exposures and
investigate the impact of COVID-19-related morbidity and long COVID symptoms on SLE disease activity in AA
women. We will invite 140 participants with SLE and 140 controls from the parent study to have data collected
on COVID-19 past infection and vaccination, long COVID symptoms, and census-tract and individual-level
SDOH. Samples will be collected and assayed for levels of COVID-19 antigens and antibodies against major
SARS-CoV-2 variants. We hypothesize that SLE worsens long COVID symptoms and COVID-19 increases SLE
disease activity. We propose to: (Aim 1) investigate the effects of SLE on long COVID symptoms in AA women,
and (Aim 2) assess the impact of past COVID-19 infection on SLE disease activity in AA women. Little is known
about risk factors and predictors of long COVID in AA women with SLE. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has
complicated treatment of SLE as it is unclear if symptoms are due to SLE, past COVID-19 infection or long
COVID. We anticipate that this project will yield critical COVID-19-related and multidimensional SDOH data for
multidisciplinary applications focused on analyzing the synergistic effects of multiple exposures on SLE
outcomes in AA women. Findings will fill important knowledge gaps related to COVID-19 in AA women with and
without SLE and could help identify high-risk groups, inform prevention efforts, and guide clinical care."
11020727,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Disparities in HIV diagnoses and care continuum outcomes are paramount among racial and ethnic minority
women in the United States. These disparities are further impacted by the complex interaction of syndemic
conditions (e.g., interpersonal violence, adverse mental health, substance use). Simultaneously, structural
factors (e.g., intersectional stigma, medical mistrust, discrimination) engender health inequities among racial and
ethnic populations and have been qualitative linked to poor engagement in HIV care. Racism perpetuates HIV
stigma and medical mistrust; less commonly studied, structural racism, refers to the interplay between systems,
social forces, institutions, and processes, which may also impact engagement in HIV care. The proposed
administrative supplement seeks to fill this gap and aims to understand potential racial and ethnic differences in
the role of structural racism and other socio-structural barriers (e.g., intersectional stigma, medical mistrust,
discrimination) in the utilization and retention of HIV care and other ancillary support services among women
living with HIV in California. The proposed administrative supplement will leverage data from participants enrolled
in the Women SHINE study (Addressing Trauma from Interpersonal Violence through a Web-based Peer
Navigation-Social Support Intervention to Improve ART Adherence among Women; #R01MH125785; PI:
Stockman), a two-arm randomized control trial among non-ART adherent cisgender WLH with a history of
adulthood interpersonal violence residing in California. Quantitatively, we will leverage baseline survey data from
the parent study (n=200) that includes measures to capture structural factors (intersectional stigma, medical
mistrust discrimination) to conduct a series of logistic regression models that test for potential racial and ethnic
group differences (i.e., White, Black, Latina, and Other [Indigenous, Asian American, and Native Hawaiian and
Pacific Islander]) in the association between socio-structural factors and past year and retention in HIV care and
other ancillary support services (i.e., domestic violence agencies, mental health, substance use outpatient
clinics) (Aim 1). Qualitatively, we will generate data through in-depth interviews with WLH (n=40, 10 per racial
and ethnic group) randomized to the control arm to explore the role of structural racism and other socio-structural
factors on utilization and retention in HIV care and other ancillary support services (Aim 2). Finally, we will
triangulate the quantitative and qualitative data while conducting member checking through four focus groups by
racial and ethnic group (n=4-6 women each) (Aim 3). Collectively, this study will expand the current limited
knowledge base on racial and ethnic differences in socio-structural factors that influence care engagement
among WLH and inform innovative ways in which researchers can intervene upon these socio-structural factors
to improve HIV care engagement among WLH, particularly Black and Latina women, who are disproportionately
affected by HIV."

Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) strains belonging to sequence type (ST) 258 have spread
globally in the past decades. Their association with often-fatal ventilator-associated pneumonia is of urgent public
health concern especially in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. While numerous studies have focused on
investigating antimicrobial resistance strategies, there is still a lack of effective therapeutic agents, which urges
the need to better understand other factors that are crucial for Kp ST258 persistence. Kp ST258 strains differ
from hypervirulent strains that induce rapidly fatal infections by instead causing subacute chronic infections.
Failure to clear Kp ST258 is associated with the recruitment of monocytes (myeloid-derived suppressor cells,
MDSCs) with anti-inflammatory properties similar to those that promote the growth of tumor cells during
oncogenesis. Given that metabolic activities govern the function of immune cells, we hypothesize that Kp ST258
metabolism in a manner similar to tumor metabolism generates host metabolic stress and a milieu conducive to
the generation and expansion of immunosuppressive cells. We found that Kp ST258 stimulates a unique host
metabolic response during pulmonary infection that is characterized by the rapid depletion of glucose, stimulation
of glutaminolysis and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathways that fuel oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the accumulation of the antioxidative metabolite itaconate. This
project offers a novel approach to develop therapeutic strategies drawing upon the host metabolic response to
Kp ST258 as the main factor promoting chronic pulmonary infection. Specifically, aim 1 explores the dynamics
of the host immunometabolic response to Kp ST258. Aim 2 seeks to investigate how this response promotes
immunosuppression while aim 3 focuses on its direct effect on bacterial adaptation to and survival in the airway
by driving global changes in bacterial gene expression including the upregulation of the Type Six Secretion
System (T6SS) to counteract oxidative stress."
11024129,"Expansion of a hexanucleotide GGGGCC repeat within the first intron of the C9orf72 gene is the
primary monogenic cause for both Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal
Dementia (FTD). Despite its intronic location, expanded GGGGCC repeat is retained in the
mature mRNA, supporting a non-canonical translation initiation mechanism known as repeat-
associated non-AUG (RAN) translation. RAN translation of C9orf72 mRNA generates toxic
dipeptide repeat (DPR) proteins. These DPR proteins aggregate in the brains of affected
individuals and have been shown to induce neurodegeneration in model systems. Despite the
medical and biological importance of RAN translation, a fundamental question remains
unanswered: how does RAN translation initiate? To address this question, this proposal will use
cryo-electron microscopy along with biochemical and genetic approaches to determine how
expanded GGGGCC repeats physically interact with the ribosome to induce this spurious start
site selection in ways that generate DPR proteins. Simultaneously, we will determine the role of
protein factors that may bind to the translation initiation complex in neurons and promote RAN
translation of C9orf72 mRNA.
The innovative approach outlined in this proposal will allow us to address some fundamental
questions about mRNA translation initiation in the native environment, specifically identifying
protein factors that bind transiently to the ribosomal complex with low affinity and their role in the
regulation of RAN translation. Moreover, this proposal will provide a novel tool for studying various
neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal functions associated with aberrant mRNA translation.
Taken together, our work will provide insights into the molecular mechanism underlying RAN
translation initiation while providing insights into the contribution of this aberrant translation to ALS
and FTD."
11011091,"The Environmental Mutagenesis and Genomics Society (EMGS) was founded in 1969 to provide a forum for the
establishment and support of scientists in the field of environmental mutagenesis. The mission of the Society is
to understand and mitigate the impacts of environmental exposures on the genome to protect human health
through diverse and inclusive leadership in research, professional development, and collaboration.
For the past 54 years, EMGS members have made many of the most important discoveries pertaining to the
mechanisms of the induction of mutations, the roles of DNA repair defects and resulting mutations in toxicology
and disease susceptibility, and the challenges of assessing risks from environmental exposures to mutagens.
Recognizing the importance of its diverse mix of professionals to exchange ideas and the latest experimental
findings, the EMGS held its first meeting in Washington, DC on March 22-25, 1970, and has continued this
tradition by providing a venue for these professionals to meet annually. Each year, the EMGS Annual Meeting
Program Committee strives to represent the full spectrum of strengths of the Society, encompassing the areas
of current research that converge on the issues of environmental exposure and how cells and organisms respond
to such challenges. In this proposal, we are requesting funds to defray part of the expenses for 2024– 2028
EMGS Annual Meetings.
The 2024 Program Committee has arranged for an outstanding and expansive scientific program that consists
of a workshop, symposia, and platform and poster sessions. Throughout there is a focus on the newest findings
and technologies in basic and applied environmental science and how they are shaping future endeavors. In
addition to the scientific program, the Annual Meeting will convene meetings of the seven Special Interest Groups
(SIGs) that represent the diversity of the Society."
11011183,"Whereas amyloid deposition tends to occur broadly throughout cortical regions and with relatively uniform pattern
of progression over time, the distribution of tau is highly focal at the early stages of pathology and its propagation
to other regions demonstrates a more complex spatiotemporal evolution. In addition the relatively lower
abundance in brain of tau compared to amyloid imparts greater requirements for binding affinity and selectivity
of tau radiotracers. Although second generation tau tracers reported within the past few years appear to have
more favorable properties in this regard, all tau tracers studied to date have been reported to exhibit off-target
binding to various substrates that can confound the quantification and interpretation of imaging data.
The goal of this application is to develop innovative technologies that improve the quantification of tau PET
imaging and enhance its utility in both research and eventual clinical settings. To address the focal nature of tau
deposition especially at prodromal stages of disease, we propose a novel kernel-based reconstruction method
that uses structural MR images as prior information and incorporates motion correction to obtain images with
unprecedented spatial resolution, allowing improved localization and quantification of tau in small structures such
as the rhinal cortex and the locus coeruleus. To mitigate the effects of off-target binding, we propose a kinetic
analysis strategies to identify non-specific, tau-specific, and off-target components. We also propose modeling
tactics to estimate maps of cerebral perfusion and to complement measures of tau burden as an additional index
of brain function. Lastly, we propose deep learning strategies to gain new insights into the spreading of tau and
to predict this progression in individual subjects."
11025783,"Project Abstract
The circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, and work—often referred to as social determinants of
health (SDH)—have well-documented impacts on chronic disease outcomes and disparities. Stemming from
this strong and compelling evidence linking SDH, health, and health equity, healthcare organizations are
increasingly integrating screening for select forms of social adversity such as food insecurity, followed by
referrals to connect patients to local social services (community-clinical linkages (CCLs)). Although these
activities are being widely promoted at both the national and state levels, robust evidence about their impacts
on chronic disease prevalence and outcomes is lacking. Furthermore, there is not yet any evidence about
policy levers to increase uptake of CCLs. The state of Oregon’s Medicaid environment offers a unique
laboratory for studying both the impacts of policy levers on CCLs activities as well as the impacts of CCLs on
chronic disease outcomes and related disparities. In 2024 and 2025, the state is launching two new policies
intended to increase CCLs, including a new “Health Related Social Needs” (HRSN) benefit covering 10
categories of non-medical services and Medicaid health plan quality measures related to social risk screening
and social service referrals. We propose to conduct a quasi-experimental mixed-methods study that (1)
evaluates the impacts of Oregon’s new Medicaid social care policies on social risk screening and related
community-clinical linkages, as well as on disparities in these outcomes, and (2) evaluates the impacts of
social risk screening and related community-clinical linkages on chronic disease outcomes and healthcare
utilization, as well as on disparities in these outcomes. In the oREgon medicaid policy, SOciaL serVices, and
hEalth (RESOLVE) study, we will create a novel, comprehensive dataset that includes information about
social risk screening, referrals to social services, receipt of social services, and EHR and claims data from >
170,000 Medicaid members seen in community health centers (CHCs) across Oregon. We will use interrupted
time series methods to examine whether and how the new Medicaid policies affect rates of social risk
screening, social services referrals, and receipt of specific social services. We will also investigate the impacts
of social care activities on key chronic disease risk factors, disease outcomes, receipt of preventive care, and
healthcare utilization, as well as on disparities in these outcomes using instrumental variable analysis and
sequential target trial emulation. Qualitative interviews with healthcare and community-based organization
leaders will inform our understanding of the policies’ influence on social care activities. Interviews with clinical
delivery team members and Medicaid members will explore the mechanisms and circumstances under which
community-clinical linkages influence chronic disease outcomes and related disparities. RESOLVE will provide
critical evidence to inform social care policy efforts at both the state and national levels."
11029942,"SUMMARY
The long-term objective of this multi-PI project is to determine how host-pathogen interactions
impact entry, infection, and spread of encephalitic alphaviruses in the central nervous system
(CNS). The vector-borne neurotropic viruses, Venezuelan, eastern, and western equine
encephalitis viruses (VEEV, EEEV, WEEV), invade the CNS after subcutaneous inoculation and
initial interaction with immune sentinel cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs)
(VEEV), or fibroblastic, osteoblastic and other cell types (EEEV, WEEV). Both EEEV and VEEV
enter the brain via the hematogenous route but only VEEV is found in olfactory neurons. The
CNS lacks intraparenchymal lymphoid tissues and cannot initiate adaptive immune responses;
thus, it mainly relies on innate responses communicated through local and systemic cytokine
secretion, which modulate the status of resident neural cells and limits viral neuroinvasion and
the extent of infection. CNSresident cells may include multiple members of the neurovascular
unit (NVU) such as brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), pericytes, astrocytes,
microglia and neurons themselves that may be infected directly or acted upon by regionally or
systemically produced cytokines. VEEV is a highly lymphotropic virus eliciting robust serum
cytokine responses after peripheral inoculation, while EEEV tropism in lymphoid tissues is
highly restricted, and serum cytokine responses are much lower, and in the case of type I IFN,
often undetectable. In published studies, two primary virulence factors for EEEV in human and
murine models defined mechanisms that suppresses replication in immune sentinel myeloid
cells and greatly limit innate immune (especially interferon) responses to EEEV infection in vitro
and in vivo1. How these factors, which include the presence of binding sites for the
hematopoietic cell-specific microRNA, mir142-3p, in the EEEV 3' untranslated region (UTR)1-3,
and efficient binding of EEEV to heparan sulfate (HS) receptors on cells4,5, impact the
differential neuroinvasion and CNS dissemination of EEEV versus VEEV is unknown.
Supporting the idea that differences in EEEV versus VEEV cytokine induction may be critical to
neuroinvasion, we found that type I IFN-dependent responses directly regulate transcytosis,
preventing alphavirus entry across the BBB and modulating the level of infection and injury in
cells of the NVU6. Thus, systemic and local cytokine responses during alphavirus infection
induce BMECs and pericytes to regulate viral entry at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and
potentially other CNS sites. This is consistent with the relative extent of virus replication at
terminal stages of disease as EEEV exhibits widespread infection of neurons throughout the
CNS while VEEV replication is much more focal (unpublished). Using mutant VEEV and EEEV,
novel viral vectors that express indicators of infection (e.g., eGFP, nanoLuciferase) in vivo, we
have observed regional heterogeneity in dominant sites of entry between these alphaviruses.
With regard to BBB entry, our studies also indicate that viral neuroinvasion precedes BBB
disruption, utilizing caveolin-mediated transcytosis to cross the BBB. We hypothesize that type
I interferon responses differentially impact the entry and infection of EEEV and VEEV at
the NVU via virus-specific induction of replication-restricting innate immune responses.
To test these hypotheses we will:
Aim 1. Define alphavirus and host specific mechanism in vitro that regulate viral entry
and infection at the NVU.
Aim 2: Define the in vivo functional role of type I IFN in protection from alphavirus
neuroinvasion at the NVU."

11012774,"Background: Despite widespread recognition of its prevalence and consequences, depression in nursing
homes remains a significant public health issue, affecting 15-25% of community nursing home residents and
contributing to increased morbidity, mortality, care burden, and cost of care. In VA Community Living Centers
(CLCs) the prevalence of depression is nearly 40% and within the first six months of discharge, CLC residents
have a substantially higher risk of suicide compared with other age- and gender-matched VA users. In
accordance with VA’s Strategic Priority to prevent suicide, it is critical to explore approaches to reducing
depression that are specific to the CLC population because depression is a major risk factor for suicidality.
Evidence-based psychosocial treatments are not often used in nursing homes and, when used, little is known
about the quality or effectiveness of the interventions. Behavioral Activities Intervention (BE-ACTIV) is a 10-
week evidence-based psychosocial intervention for depression developed using nursing home staff and
resident input to build in feasibility and acceptability. BE-ACTIV is typically delivered by a mental health
therapist in collaboration with recreational therapy to engage residents in personally meaningful pleasant
activities. This type of approach to improving mental health care is in line with VA’s strategic goals to provide
timely and integrated care that emphasizes Veteran’s well-being and independence.
Objectives: Three gaps must be addressed before BE-ACTIV can be used successfully in CLCs: (1) Adapting
it for the short-stay CLC population, is largely male with higher prevalence of serious mental illness and
substance abuse disorders, (2) Developing a delivery strategy that adapts BE-ACTIV’s current in-person
training and oversight processes for the context of a complex, national system of nursing homes, and (3)
Comparing implementation strategies to facilitate regional or national roll out. We will compare onsite and
remote applications of the LOCK implementation framework, which was developed for use in the CLC context.
The four tenets of the LOCK implementation framework are: 1) Look for the bright spots, 2) Observe, 3)
Collaborate in huddles, and 4) Keep it bite-sized.
Methods: This Hybrid Type 2 Implementation-Effectiveness study will use a mixed methods approach. In Aim
1, at two CLCs, researchers will (a) conduct telephone interviews with CLC staff about adaptation of the BE-
ACTIV training materials and implementation guide and (b) test the adapted BE-ACTIV VA training materials
and implementation guide for user comprehensibility with CLC staff. In Aim 2, 6 sites will implement BE-ACTIV
VA, each over a 6-month period. For this, three sites will have onsite training and check-ins for the
implementation and three will have remote training and check-ins. Aim 3 will be dedicated to finalizing the
training materials and implementation guide based on the input received from staff, our advisory panel, and
data collected at the 6 Aim 2 study sites.
Anticipated Impacts: The result of this work will be an evidence-based standardized manual for BE-ACTIV
VA to reduce depression among CLC residents and an implementation guide to incorporate BE-ACTIV VA into
the usual routines for resident assessment, care planning, and preparation for discharge. As an evidence-
based intervention developed for use in community nursing homes, BE-ACTIV VA has a high likelihood of
success if implemented effectively. Identifying a successful implementation strategy using the LOCK
framework will allow for wider dissemination of BE-ACTIV VA in CLCs nationally and create opportunities to
implement the intervention in other VA community-based long-term care programs (e.g., home-based primary
care, medical foster homes, State Veterans Homes, etc.). We will use the findings from this research to work
with our VACO partners and other communication channels to disseminate BE-ACTIV VA."
11011101,"Project Summary
It has become increasingly clear that the future of nursing and healthcare practice demands an
understanding of social inequities and the development of educational and research strategies to affect
population-level change and address health inequities. Studies on the efficacy of methods and
standardization of social determinants of health (SDOH) curricula have sowed the seeds for improved
teaching and assessment standards and best practices, however the primary focus of SDOH education has
been on clinical practice rather than research. Research must compel actionable change and address a
plethora of research gaps related to social factors, upstream and downstream factors, life course factors,
biological mechanisms and pathways, global data gaps, lack of political will, and the impact of sex and
gender on SDOH. Nursing in particular plays a critical role in simulating and accelerating SDOH research
and historically has always taken the lead in addressing social issues in healthcare and education,
particularly among vulnerable populations. Social justice is practically inherent to nursing and the nursing
field can cultivate a culture that promotes SDOH education, collaboration, and research among other
health care professionals and communities so that SDOH can be fully integrated into patient care,
education, and research. The next cadre of nurse scientists, as well as those from other aligned fields,
must be educated to develop and apply health equity and SDOH lenses as primary foci through which to
design and implement research that considers population and community health, prevention and health
promotion, and the systems and models that affect the provision of affirming, inclusive care for diverse
populations. We propose a short course that will prepare nursing and other health professional researchers
to plan a community-based participatory research (CBPR) study, integrating intersectionality
considerations, to investigate and address the impacts of SDOH on the health of vulnerable or
underserved populations. The short course is increasingly viewed as a useful tool for continuous training
to update and deepen knowledge in various fields and across topics, making it a prime fit for the goal of
responding to the urgency of improving faster research translation of scientific SDOH knowledge into
practical applications for nursing scientists and other scientist in aligned fields."
11019219,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In Latin America, sexual and gender minorities are disproportionately affected by HIV. Recent data from the
proposed study setting of Peru suggests that the prevalence of HIV is as high as 12% among men who have
sex with men (MSM) and 21% among transgender women (TGW), with >60% of new infections occurring in
these key populations.
Homophobia, transphobia and exaggerated masculinity (i.e., machismo) are pervasive in Latin America: one
survey found that over 60% of sexual and gender minorities felt they could not disclose their sexual orientation
or gender identity without fear, and 30% reported that their family was unaware of their sexual orientation. To
avoid stigmatizing labels, individuals may elect not to disclose sexual or gender identity and withhold relevant
information on sexual behaviors from healthcare providers. They may also incorrectly assess their own risk for
important medical conditions (e.g., MPox, HIV) and opt not to engage in preventive health interventions (e.g.,
PrEP, HIV testing). Furthermore, the evolving terminology used to describe sexual and gender identity may vary
across educational and socioeconomic status, challenging the meaningful interpretation of standardized
sociodemographic surveys on sexual and gender identity.
The overall goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of how sexual and gender identity are
conceived by youth in an urban Latin American setting. We will leverage an ongoing social-behavioral
intervention trial enrolling adolescents and young adults living with HIV and strong ties with the LGBTQI+
community in Lima, Peru to explore (1) how sexual identity aligns with prior consensual sexual behavior; (2)
perceptions of common terms used to describe sexual and gender identity and differences according to
education and socioeconomic status; and (3) reasons that sexual and gender minorities refuse, withdraw from,
or have limited in engagement with healthcare, research and/or intervention activities. The findings from this
research will be critical to tailoring HIV prevention messages; deriving terminology that is intuitive and aligned
with the Peruvian population for patient-centered HIV care and research activities; and ensuring that that sexual
and gender minorities can fully avail of existing health interventions and health research."

11031527,"Innate defensive behaviors promote survival by allowing animals to detect and respond to threats within their environment, such as predators. Although innate, these defensive behaviors show a remarkable amount of flexibility and are subject to robust habituation, suggesting that the circuitry underlying defensive behaviors is subject to modulatory control. Our recent work suggests that the cerebellum may provide one source of afferent modulatory influence within the periaqueductal gray. We find that cerebellar afferents to the freezing-related circuitry in ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) predominantly activate local dopaminergic interneurons, which subsequently alter the relative strength of synaptically evoked inhibition and excitation onto freezing premotor neurons. More specifically, cerebellar activation increases IPSC amplitudes and decreases EPSC amplitudes, which is predicted to increase spike threshold and alter the input-output relationship, altering the integrative properties of freezing premotor neurons. These results motivate testing the hypothesis that the cerebellum modulates the expression of innate defensive behaviors through activation of local vlPAG dopamine neurons. To test this hypothesis, a combination of in vivo behavioral and systems-level approaches will be used to manipulate cerebellar input and record cerebellar activity during innate freezing behaviors to determine the nature of the cerebellar signals produced, and their resulting effects on expression of freezing behavior. To study the role of vlPAG dopamine neurons in modulating innate freezing behaviors, I will similarly record and manipulate vlPAG dopamine neuron activity using fiber photometry and optogenetic actuators. Finally, because selective lesions of vlPAG dopamine neurons disrupt both fear memory formation in mice (as do disruptions in cerebellar plasticity), I will test the hypothesis that cerebellar associative plasticity contributes to fear memory formation by modulating vlPAG dopamine activity. Together, these experiments provide a framework for understanding how the cerebellum modulates both innate freezing and more broadly how cerebellar plasticity contributes to learned defensive behaviors."
11030887,"Our recent studies have demonstrated that mitochondrial fission is tightly connected to lipid metabolism and
more specifically, that mitochondrial fission is an inherent element in oxidation of long chain fatty acids by the
orexigenic AgRP neurons (Jin et al., 2021). Intriguingly, while mitochondrial fission is associated with lipid
catabolic processes, mitochondrial fusion is associated with lipid anabolism. More specifically, mitofusin 2, critical
mitochondrial fusion protein, plays a critical role in the formation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-mitochondria
contact sites, relevant sites of lipid metabolism where intact fatty acids are used as precursors for the generation,
for example, of sphingolipids. Besides mitofusin 2, other proteins have been shown to regulate the ER-
mitochondria interaction. Among those, the Neurite OutGrowth inhibitor (Nogo), a member of the reticulon family
of proteins (Reticulon 4 gene; Rtn4) located on the ER, plays also a critical role in regulating sphingolipids
production (Cantalupo et al., 2015). Among sphingolipids, Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) has been shown to
play a crucial role in a large number of physiological processes including most recently feeding behavior via its
action in the hypothalamus. However, the specific site of synthesis of S1P and its target within the hypothalamus
have not been identified. Our preliminary data have shown that AgRP neurons are enriched of enzymes involved
in the S1P de novo biosynthesis and their mRNA levels are regulated by the metabolic state, with fasting
upregulating Nogo mRNA levels while downregulating all the enzymes involved in the synthesis of S1P. In line
with this, we observed that S1P levels in the arcuate nucleus are downregulated during food deprivation. As the
multitude of different S1P-mediated actions is linked to its capacity to be secreted, we found that S1P receptors
are expressed in the neighboring anorexigenic POMC neurons where S1P significantly induced their activation
by in vivo calcium imaging. Interestingly, we also observed that the expression of Nogo and several of the
enzymes involved in the S1P de novo synthesis, together with S1P levels, are altered in diet-induced obesity
(DIO). Altogether our data gave impetus to the central hypothesis that Nogo is a critical regulator of AgRP
neuronal function and feeding behavior by regulating fatty acid metabolic pathways (catabolism versus
anabolism) and that dysregulation of fatty acid metabolism during high fat diet (HFD) plays a role in DIO.
Specifically, we hypothesize that when activated during fasting in AgRP neurons, Nogo by inhibiting S1P de
novo biosynthesis will direct fatty acids to oxidation by the mitochondria (catabolic pathway) thus, activating
AgRP neurons and inducing feeding behavior (Aim 1). On the other hand, Nogo downregulation in AgRP
neurons during fed state will disinhibit S1P de novo biosynthesis (thus promoting the anabolic pathway), and by
acting via its receptors, S1P will affect AgRP target neurons resulting in decreased food intake (Aim 2). Finally,
dysregulation of this pathway and the resulting imbalance in sphingolipid metabolism (increased ceramides
production but decreased S1P generation) during HFD plays a role in DIO (Aim 3)."
10854716,"Project Summary/Abstract
Non-urban populations are given little attention in many aspects of medical practice. Rural communities often
lack the infrastructure for developing and sustaining a preventive approach to occupational disease and injury,
particularly for specific work sectors such as agriculture, where the hired and/or migrant workforce may
constitute the majority. Northeast Texas, home to about 1.5 million people spanning 35 counties, is considered
the largest rurally distributed population in the state, and is also one of the unhealthiest. There is a
considerable need to train medical students and graduates in general, and occupational medicine residents in
particular, to be competent in knowledge and skills pertaining to rural and migrant populations, who have
special cultural needs and considerations.
As the region’s only university medical center, the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler
(UTHSCT) is home to some of the latest developments in patient care and community health, medical and
health education, and biomedical and clinical research. There is a physician shortage in rural counties
throughout Northeast Texas, and UTHSCT has the responsibility of training the future generation of physicians.
The occupational medicine residency program at Tyler (OMR) is one of seven ACGME-accredited graduate
medical education (GME) programs sponsored by the institution. The overall objective and mission of the
program is; ‘to increase the number of occupational medicine physicians who have adequate experience and
sufficient competence to enter the practice without direct supervision, while adding a special focus on training
in the occupational health needs of the rural workforce, to help serve the population of Northeast Texas and
beyond’. This is in alignment with the overall mission of the institution.
Specific aims of the program are to: 1. Increase the number of board certified occupational medicine graduates
able to engage in evidence based and independent practice in various settings including the proportion
remaining in Texas and rural areas, 2. Enhance a robust residency experience in rural / agricultural
occupational health, safety, protection and promotion.
There remains a recognized burden of occupational injury and illness in general and in agriculture specifically.
This proposal is considered responsive to the Funding Opportunity Announcement PAR-15-352 by addressing
a critical gap in Occupational Medicine Residency (OMR) trained physician workforce needs (core discipline).
The proposed program will integrate agricultural safety and health by implementing a multi-faceted training
approach that relies upon an inter-professional educational team effort, while also leveraging the strengths of
the NIOSH-supported Southwest Center for Agricultural Health, Injury Prevention and Education to achieve a
significant impact on continued workforce expansion."

 Our research program focuses on the mechanism of eukaryotic protein synthesis and translational
control. The two projects we are currently studying are: (1) the mechanism of translational control by the fragile
X mental retardation protein (FMRP), and (2) the mechanism of translation initiation on influenza A virus (IAV)
mRNAs. Fragile X syndrome is a disease that afflicts about 100,000 Americans and about 3 million people
worldwide, resulting in intellectual disability, childhood seizures, and autistic behavior in the patients. The
disease is caused by the transcriptional silencing of the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1). FMR1 gene
codes for an RNA-binding protein, FMRP, which is highly expressed in the brain and is essential for the brain's
normal development. Mammals have two autosomal paralogs of FMRP designated as fragile X-related 1 and 2
(FXR1 and FXR2) proteins. FMRP, FXR1, and FXR2 have been implicated in regulating the translation of
several mRNAs. However, the precise mechanism by which these proteins regulate the expression of these
mRNAs is unknown. The first project aims to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of
protein synthesis by FMRP, FXR1, and FXR2. We will use a robust in vitro translation system, biochemical
techniques, and quantitative biophysical methods to significantly advance our understanding of the molecular
mechanism used by FMRP, FXR1, and FXR2 to regulate protein synthesis. The results of these studies will
provide valuable insights into identifying potential drug targets to treat Fragile X syndrome.
 The second project aims to investigate the mechanism of translation initiation by IAV mRNAs. IAV is
responsible for several thousand deaths annually and is a severe threat to global public health. We have new
data that indicate that IAV mRNAs may use a non-canonical mechanism of translation initiation. Our studies
show that poly A binding protein 1 (PABP1) binds to the highly conserved sequences in the 5'-UTR of IAV
mRNAs. Additionally, we show that the translation of the IAV mRNA is more resistant to the inactivation of
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) compared to a control mRNA. We hypothesize that the recruitment of
PABP1 to the viral 5'-UTRs tethers eIF4G and promotes the assembly of the translation initiation complex in an
eIF4E-independent manner. This may favor the translation of IAV mRNAs under cellular stress conditions in the
cell, which is known to reduce the activity of eIF4E. We will determine whether the binding of PABP1 to the 5'-
UTR of IAV mRNAs is essential for translation initiation and the viral cycle using in vitro techniques and cellular
IAV infection studies. Our research will lead to fundamental new knowledge about the translation initiation
process on IAV mRNAs, which could help develop new antiviral drugs."

Maintaining the junctional epithelium (JE) is of primary importance if preservation of the cementum, periodontal ligament
(PDL), and alveolar bone is to be achieved. New insights into JE barrier functions came with our discovery of a Wnt-
responsive stem cell niche in the JE. In this proposal, our goal is to characterize the cellular players, niche signals, and
regulatory mechanisms that control and maintain the JE stem cell niche in health, and after damage or disease.
AIM 1 experiments will first test whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for JE maintenance. Pathway inhibition will
be achieved in Axin2LacZ/+ mice using adenovirus expressing the soluble Wnt inhibitor Dkk1; controls will receive adenovirus
encoding the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G. At defined intervals, quantitative analyses will assess endogenous Wnt/β-
catenin signaling via Xgal staining; JE hemidesmosomal gene and protein distribution via quantitative
immunohistochemistry (qIHC); JE and GE cell cycle kinetics by EdU/BrdU labeling; and inflammatory cell infiltration in
connective tissues underlying the JE and GE by FACS. Second, whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for JE
regeneration will be determined by subjecting Wnt lineage tracer e.g., Axin2CreERT2/+;R26RmTmG/+ mice to partial gingivectomy
followed by Ad-Dkk1/Ad-Fc delivery. Lineage-tracing and quantitative analyses will establish a relationship between Wnt-
responsive cell progeny, cell cycle kinetics, hemidesmosomal gene and protein distribution, and regeneration of JE barrier
functions.
AIM 2 experiments will evaluate the ability of a stabilized formulation of WNT protein to regenerate a functional JE. In one
injury-repair model the JE will be surgically excised; in a second model, JE breakdown will be triggered via a ligature-induced
periodontitis; both will be carried out in Axin2LacZ/+ and Axin2CreERT2/+;R26RmTmG/+ mice. Delivery of the WNT therapeutic will
be followed at multiple timepoints by quantitative analyses to assess re-establishment of JE barrier functions.
AIM 3 experiments will characterize Wnt-responsive JE stem cells and their progeny. Wnt-responsive stem cell pools from
adjacent gingival epithelium (GE) will serve as control. Axin2CreERT2/+;R26RmTmG/+ mice will be exposed to tamoxifen, followed
by harvest of JE and GE tissues at defined timepoints. GFP+ cells will be sorted by flow cytometry. Gene expression profiling
of GFP+ cells will focus stem cell and differentiation markers. Fluorescent in situ hybridization will confirm gene expression
patterns using RNA probe libraries corresponding to stem cell markers, components of Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Bone
Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathways. Collectively, this proposal promises to provide important new insights into the
requirement for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in maintaining the JE stem cell niche; regulating JE and GE cell proliferation and
differentiation; and influencing hemidesmosomal-mediated attachment to the tooth surface. In addition, it should resolve
the current debate over the molecular identities of JE v. GE stem cell pools and their differentiation potential. The proposed
work also has the potential to identify an innovative therapeutic strategy for rebuilding a damaged JE and thus open new
avenues for the restoration of the soft tissue attachment following periodontal diseases."
11031698,"Abstract
Ion channels are exquisite molecular machines that regulate the flow of ions across cell membranes in
response to stimuli such as voltage and small molecule ligands (e.g. second messengers, and
neurotransmitters). They underlie all electrical excitability in the brain and heart, and defects in ion channels
are responsible for many human disorders. Despite decades of experiments and many high-resolution
molecular structures, we still do not know, for any channel, the mechanisms for voltage- or ligand-dependent
gating. The missing ingredient is conformational energetics. The energetics of the different channel
conformations governs the time course, voltage dependence, and ligand dependence of opening of the
channel pore, and ultimately electrical excitability of the cell. In the parent grant, our goals are to determine the
mechanisms of voltage-dependent gating and ligand-dependent gating and, ultimately, to understand the
general themes that underlie allosteric regulation of ion channels. Our approach has been to leverage
breakthrough FRET methods we developed for measuring intramolecular distance distributions and
conformational energetics using fluorescence lifetimes. One limitation of this approach is that it can only
measure equilibrium energetics. To truly determine the structural dynamics and energetics, we need to
measure the rates of the conformational transitions in the protein. To measure conformational transition rates
at steady state, we need to perform single-molecule experiments. This proposal is for a PicoQuant MicroTime
100 upgrade to our current PicoQuant system, previously purchased with the parent award, that would allow us
to do time-resolved confocal microscopy to measure single-molecule FRET. The requested equipment will
further accelerate our progress toward the goals of the parent grant."

Summary:
In this HBCU BEITA project we propose to establish an interdisciplinary Center for Research and Education in
Multiscale Bioengineering, Bioimaging, and Biosensing (REMB3 Center) at Delaware State University (DSU).
DSU is an HBCU and a primarily undergraduate institution with a strong commitment to integrate teaching
excellence with research and innovation. Over the UG3 and HG3 phases of this applicationthe Center will
create a synergistic and nurturing environment for promoting bioengineering and biomedical engineering and
for advancing technology and innovation in bioimaging and biosensing for improving human health. The
Center’s focus will be: 1) to create a comprehensive integrated bioengineering program with emerging data
science discipline and modern medical technologies at DSU; 2) to establish articulation agreements with
University of Delaware and Rowan University to open pipelines to DSU students to enroll in BS+MS degrees
in biomedical engineering; 3) to strengthen the institutional capacity for advancing and sustaining research in
bioimaging, biosensing, and data-driven methodologies; 4) to foster an environment for advancing diversity,
equity, and access, enabling a diversified next-generation workforce in bioengineering and biomedical
engineering careers; 5) to develop a hub for promoting bio-entrepreneurship and networking with biomedical
professionals.
 The REMB3 Center will facilitate and provide support for 1) establishing curricular programs and research
infrastructure in bioengineering and biomedical research to be accessible to students and REMB3 researchers;
2) early-stage investigators at DSU who are pursuing research at the interface between optical science,
engineering, data science, and life-science; 3) mentoring these investigators to achieve grant success and
scientific maturity and to become independent externally-funded researchers; and 4) talented students -
undergraduate and graduate- from underrepresented groups in STEM fields to participate in REMB3 summer
internship program or to complete successfully their graduate degrees. One major underlying pillar of the
REMB3 Center is the emphasis on underrepresented researchers’ strengths and competencies and the value
of diversity in research and science. As such REMB3 Center will expand access to training in bioengineering
and data science research by increasing accessibility across socioeconomic and racial lines and will address
issues in ethics and biases in biomedical research and technology. Once established the Center will be a hub
for a dynamic research community interested in bioengineering, bioimaging, and biosensing as well as for an
emerging group of bio-entrepreneurs.
 The success of the REMB3 Center will be measured by how well the initiative expands our research and
training capacity to build a diverse and talented workforce. This will include: the number and diversity of
recruited and trained researchers and students, the number of grant awards, the enrollment, retention, and
graduation of the educational programs, the number and quality of developed medical technologies, the short-
and long-term sustainability mechanisms, and the success of our trainees in entering bioengineering and
biomedical engineering careers. Moreover, the Center will contribute to strengthening the engineering and data
science research infrastructure at DSU in a way that fosters inclusivity, equity, and diversity."

Disparities continue to persist across sexual orientation, gender identity, and region for people living with HIV
(PLWH). Some of the highest rates of HIV are among sexual and gender diverse (SGD; i.e., do not exclusively
identify as heterosexual or cisgender) people, a high-risk group for developing anal cancer, in the U.S. South.
In efforts to increase anal cancer screening among SGD PLWH in Georgia, the proposed NINR Diversity
Supplement uses an explanatory sequential study design (1) to examine the association between perceived
HIV-related stigma and self-reported completion of anal cancer screening (via the 12-item HIV Stigma Scale),
and then (2) to explore the phenomenon between HIV-related stigma, perceived social support, and cancer
prevention behaviors (e.g., anal cancer screening) among SGD PLWH in Georgia. For the quantitative study
(Aim 1), we will start with a bivariate descriptive statistical analysis of the overall individual-level characteristics
(e.g., demographics, behavioral, and clinical-related factors) of SGD PLWH. Then, as appropriate, we will
conduct two-tailed chi-square tests, T-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and multivariable logistic regression
modeling to evaluate the association between HIV stigma and anal cancer screening, with the inclusion of
covariates found to be significant in bivariate comparisons. We expect to have a sample size of 150
participants for Aim 1. We will report 2-sided p-values, adjusted odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) with an indication of the significance level at α < .05. For the qualitative study (Aim 2), we will
conduct descriptive statistics (i.e., frequencies, percentages, means, medians) to characterize the socio-
demographic characteristics of focus group participants. We expect to conduct 3 focus groups of 5-10 people
each for Aim 2. The objectives for Mr. Fuller’s pre-doctoral research training are to: (1) gain research
experiences needed to negotiate university resources, (2) develop knowledge and skills to develop and
maintain patient tracking systems, (3) gain experience in monitoring and managing ongoing threats to the
integrity of a multi-site research project; (4) develop knowledge and skills to develop data entry systems, data
coding protocols, and data cleaning; and (5) gain continued experience in statistical analysis and interpretation
of data. If awarded this supplement in the summer (June 2024), Mr. Fuller seeks to: (1) present the findings at
a national conference, (2) publish a first-authored peer-reviewed manuscript, (3) use findings as pilot data to
submit for a competitive pre-doctoral training fellowship (F99/K00), and (4) write an editorial, commentary, or
other non-peer-reviewed editorial piece to reach the lay community. Successful completion of the study’s aims
will also provide the supplement candidate with structured research/training and career development
opportunities to develop as an emerging independent investigator."
11012090,"Determining the association of nursing on patients with intellectual or developmental disabilities in the
 acute care setting
The NIH recently designated persons with disabilities as a health disparities population. The disparities
experienced by those with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) include a greater incidence of
physical and mental ailments, increased morbidity and mortality, barriers to high quality care, stigma, biases,
social disadvantage, and marginalization. However, there is a gap in the literature about approaches to
reducing health disparities in the IDD population. Most research focuses on parents of IDD children, parents
who have IDD, care for those who have dual diagnoses of IDD and another health problem, challenging
behavior, and IDD caregiver burnout. To close the gap, we are proposing a supplement to R01NR014855 to
utilize data collected in the parent grant to undertake novel methods to create individual risk profiles, using
comorbidities, social determinants of health (SDOH) and IDD diagnoses, and to quantify the association of
nursing resource factors on the risk adjusted outcomes of adult patients with IDD. Intersecting comorbidities,
SDOH, and IDD diagnoses are expected to contribute to meaningful variation in clinical risk in the hospitalized
IDD population. Quantifying the variable risk arising at the intersection of IDD, comorbidities, and SDOH is
important because a particular challenge for this population is diagnostic overshadowing—when symptoms are
misattributed to IDD rather than comorbidities and social determinant factors. Diagnostic overshadowing
reduces quality of care and has been shown to lead to poor outcomes including increased mortality. Diagnostic
overshadowing occurs more frequently when providers face time pressures, have poor teamwork, and lack
resources. There is promising evidence that outcome disparities are reduced for other vulnerable populations,
such as patients with serious mental illness and those with opioid use disorder, when they receive care in
hospitals with better nursing resources, including increased nursing education, improved staffing, and more
supportive work environments. The extent to which nursing resources are associated with IDD hospital patient
outcomes is not known. The proposed study expands upon previous studies by: (1) quantitative research
methods to specify pathways by which nursing resources might decrease adult IDD length of stay or
readmission rates; (2) utilizing the secondary nursing data in the process of exploring adult IDD outcomes; and
(3) ultimately using comorbidities, SDOH and IDD risk profiles to estimate which adult IDD patients may
significantly benefit from greater nursing resources. Results will greatly improve our ability to target which
nursing resources may benefit adult IDD patients. The central hypothesis is that an investment in nursing
resources for the highest risk IDD inpatients will improve patient outcomes."
11024339,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Up to 80% of patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) receiving dialysis have secondary
hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), a condition of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism which is associated with
higher mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, and parathyroidectomy. Calcimimetics, a mainstay of
treatment for SHPT, act by lowering parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion; cinacalcet and etelcalcetide are the
two FDA-approved calcimimetics available in the United States. Before 2018, over 20% of Medicare
beneficiaries lacked access to these medications because they lack Medicare Part D (prescription drug
coverage). In 2018, all dialysis patients suddenly gained access through a change in Medicare policy known as
the Transitional Drug Add-On Payment Adjustment (TDAPA). Using administrative claims data from the United
States Renal Data System (USRDS), which houses Medicare claims for all individuals on dialysis, this project
will leverage the TDAPA policy as a natural experiment to evaluate its effect on calcimimetic prescriptions and
subsequent patient morbidity and mortality.
 Aim 1 seeks to compare the prescribing patterns of calcimimetics for individuals on dialysis before and
during TDAPA, using a longitudinal differences-in-differences analysis to estimate the effect of the TDAPA
policy in patients without Medicare Part D coverage. Early studies of TDAPA suggest that calcimimetic
prescription patterns varied widely from facility to facility. Sub-Aim 1a will study differences between cinacalcet
and etelcalcetide use after implementation of TDAPA, focusing on comparing the facility characteristics
associated with greater likelihood of etelcalcetide use.
 Aim 2 attempts to evaluate SHPT-associated outcomes and determine whether expanded access to
calcimimetics ameliorated poor outcomes through a differences-in-differences analysis of TDAPA. Though
SHPT is associated with morbidity and mortality, whether calcimimetics can improve such outcomes is less
clear, owing to limitations of randomized-controlled trials. In this aim, the TDAPA policy will be used as a
natural experiment to examine the causal, real-world effect of calcimimetics on SHPT-associated outcomes,
with broader implications for examining how Medicare policies affect important outcomes for patients on
dialysis.
 The proposed work will serve as a post-doctoral fellowship training vehicle for the applicant at Stanford
University, under an interdisciplinary mentorship team bridging Stanford’s Division of Nephrology and
Department of Health Policy, with collaboration from the University of Southern California. This team brings
expertise in bone mineral disease, USRDS data, and econometrics that will equip the trainee with the
necessary skills to advance her career in health services research with a focus on the ESKD population."
11012029,"American Indian (AI) communities experience higher rates of liver cancer incidence and mortality than the
general United States (U.S.) population, particularly in the Southwest Region. Common risk factors for liver
cancer include having hepatitis B or hepatitis C, cirrhosis, excessive alcohol consumption, lack of physical

obesity-related diseases is experienced by AI people in the U.S. when compared to all other racial/ethnic
groups, making their health status a key public health issue. Despite the clear need to develop effective liver
cancer prevention strategies, health disparities remain among AI communities and within the scientific
literature. To address these significant health disparities, the interdisciplinary team and Pascua Yaqui Tribe will
investigate strategies to improve liver cancer prevention and health equity for AI communities. We will apply
the ‘two-eyed seeing’ paradigm to see from one eye with the strengths of the Yoeme knowledge and ways of
knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths integrated scientific approaches for community-engaged
research methods. This high impact effort will advance research for liver cancer prevention in a high-risk group
that carries a disparate liver cancer burden. The Specific Aims are to: 1) examine Yoeme adults’ attitudes and
beliefs of liver cancer health risk (e.g., lifestyle, diet, lived experiences, biological, environmental); 2) assess
the prevalence and characterize risk factors for NAFLD, a known risk factor for liver cancer, in a sample of 150
adults recruited from a Pascua Yaqui clinic; and 3) determine the potential for the implementation and
dissemination with reciprocity of an existing evidence-based lifestyle-based intervention (DPTP) tailored for
NAFLD risk reduction in clinic-based settings. The study team’s efforts are centered in developing a
sustainable research agenda for Yoeme communities that fosters interdisciplinary, collaborative research,
education, and outreach. This proposed study directly benefits the community by 1) creating representative
scientific evidence that can inform health policy and clinical guidelines, 2) increasing access to health services
(e.g., liver disease screening) that improve understanding of risk factors related to liver cancer, 3) building
culturally relevant research capacity within Yoeme communities that experience a disproportionate burden of
obesity-related health disparities, and 4) providing valuable research training to Yoeme people and early-
career investigators. Further, this study will provide the interdisciplinary research team, led by Dr. David O.
Garcia (Co-Leader/UA) and Dr. Priscilla R. Sanderson (Co-Leader/NAU), in partnership with Dr. Adalberto
Renteria (Pascua Yaqui Medical Director; Co-I), with the preliminary data to develop an R01 proposal to test
the effectiveness of a culturally and clinically relevant intervention. The goal is to reduce liver cancer health
risks among Yoeme adult men and women who are considered at high-risk and are an underserved population

Pathogenic variants in the Cyclin-dependent kinase like 5 (CDKL5) gene cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder
(CDD, MIM 300672, 105830) a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) associated with
cognitive and motor dysfunction and cortical visual impairment. Recent data suggest CDD is one of the most
common genetic causes of DEE. Work in CDD animal models has demonstrated the ability for disease
modification and symptom reversal: worldwide efforts are now underway to develop therapeutic strategies
(including gene therapy) to treat and potentially cure CDD. While there are four active clinical trials, none
assesses the full spectrum of this DEE to address true disease modification. While capability for disease
modifying therapies is accelerating, there is a critical barrier for clinical trial readiness that may result
in failure of these therapies, not due to lack of efficacy but due to lack of validated outcome measures.
 CDD has been associated historically with Rett syndrome but there are many clear distinctions and CDD
has emerged as an independent disorder. Some Clinical Outcome Measures (COMs) can be adapted from Rett
syndrome COMs, whereas others need to be developed specifically for CDD. Our research network is uniquely
positioned to develop clinical trial readiness for CDD by pairing exceptional experience in the development and
validation of outcome measures with an extensive network of CDD experts and clinical trialists. Our goals are
to 1) refine and validate appropriate quantitative COMs and biomarkers and 2) conduct a multi-site clinical trial
readiness study to ensure that they can be successfully implemented. We will test the hypothesis that CDD
specific COMs can be refined to accurately and reproducibly track meaningful changes in clinical trials:
Aim 1: Generate and validate a suite of COMs and biomarkers necessary to comprehensively assess
disease modification in CDD.
Aim 2: Conduct a multi-site clinical trial readiness study to assess implementation, longitudinal stability,
and collect baseline COMs and EEG/evoked potential data.
Overall Impact: These outcome measures will establish clinical trial readiness for CDD and generate historic
baseline outcome data, ensuring optimal testing of potential new therapeutics including gene therapy.
Furthermore, these measures will be adaptable to other DEEs by enabling choices of outcome measures beyond
existing NINDS supported measurement tools (NeuroQoL, PROMIS, Toolbox) that are not designed for the
severity of the DEE populations."

Cocaine addiction exerts a high cost on society and individuals and to date no pharmacotherapies exist.
Behavioral therapies are not effective at preventing relapse; indeed, 70-80% of cocaine users will experience
relapse following therapy. Preventing relapse to cocaine use represents the primary challenge that exists for
the treatment of cocaine dependent individuals. One of the many factors that contribute to relapse is the
exceptionally strong associations that drugs of abuse, such as cocaine make between environmental contexts
and the rewarding properties of the drug. Thus, understanding the neural mechanisms that are responsible for
these drug-context associations and ways in which we can override them, is critical for the development of
improved treatment options. The dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), well known for its role in learning and memory,
is an important anatomical region involved in cocaine-context associations. Despite this knowledge, the role of
this brain region in cocaine addiction remains understudied. Work from our laboratory has identified a novel role
for the Cav1.2 L-type Ca2+ channel (LTCC) in the dHPC in extinction of cocaine-associated contextual memories,
consistent with their well-known role in hippocampal-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying certain forms of
learning/memory. Extinction learning involves a new form of learning that is capable of overriding original
memories, particularly maladaptive memories. Thus Cav1.2 channels serve as a promising candidate for
overriding drug-context associations. Using the cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP), a preclinical model
used to study cocaine-associated contextual memories, we find that extinction of cocaine CPP increases
synaptic levels of Cav1.2 and its phosphorylated form in the dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG), a hippocampal
subregion, in a dopamine D1 receptor cell type-dependent manner. This is consistent with growing evidence for
a role of dHPC dopamine for learning/memory mechanisms including cocaine contextual memories. Our
molecular studies have identified that extinction increases key signaling molecules in the dDG. These include
AKAP150 anchoring protein, PKA, NFATc3 and the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors. Thus, in this application
we aim to capitalize on this knowledge to further explore dDG Cav1.2 channel mechanisms in extinction of
cocaine-associated memories. We will test the central hypothesis that contextual extinction learning recruits
Cav1.2 channel mechanisms at dDG synapses via recruiting dopamine D1R signaling. We will use a combination
of genetic, pharmacological, electrophysiological, and in vivo calcium imaging techniques with behavioral testing
for the proposed studies. Aim 1 will test the involvement of AKAP-PKA-Cav1.2 signaling. Aim 2 will address the
involvement of AKAP-CaN-NFAT signaling and Aim 3 will examine the contribution of D1R signaling, in cocaine
CPP extinction and dDG cell activity."
11031534,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The PI’s lab has long-term interest in how aberrant mitosis occurs and its relationship to cancer cell heterogeneity.
Our prior work has contributed to current understanding about the spindle assembly checkpoint, a critical
mechanism to prevent chromosomal instability. Many other factors also help control the fidelity of chromosome
segregation. Most relevant to this proposal, there was some evidence indicating that defects in mitochondrial
dynamics affect chromosome segregation, but detailed mechanistic analysis is still lacking. Mitochondrial Fission
Regulator 2 (MTFR2, also named FAM54A or DUFD1) was retrieved as a gene co-transcribed with key
centromere/kinetochore components in our previous study. Such association suggested a role of MTFR2 in
mitosis. However, despite the name, not much is known about the biological function or regulation of MTFR2 at
the cellular level. Our preliminary results demonstrated that MTFR2 regulates mitochondrial fission in a Drp1-
dependent manner. We also found that many cancer-occurring MTFR2 variants are defective in triggering
mitochondrial fission. In addition, conditional MTFR2 knockout by inducible Cas9/CRISPR resulted in loss of
astral microtubules and multipolar spindles during mitosis, resulting in chromosome missegregation. Building
upon the preliminary data, we hypothesize that MTFR2 plays critical roles in coordinating mitochondrial
fission and chromosome segregation during mitosis. The overall objective of this project is to further clarify
the MTFR2 activity in mitochondrial fission and mitotic progression, and conversely how cell cycle machinery
regulates MTFR2 activity. Aim 1 experiments will elucidate the activities and mechanisms of MTFR2 in
mitochondrial fission especially during mitosis, and Aim 2 experiments will investigate how compromising MTFR2
activity in mitosis affects chromosome missegregation and taxol resistance. The proposal is expected to expand
our understanding about mitochondrial fission mechanisms, and provide insights how mitochondria and
chromosome inheritance are coordinated during mitosis to ensure healthy daughter cells. The collaborative
project will provide an invaluable platform at the University of Toledo to support and train undergraduate students
for hands-on research experience."

 Although there is a robust training infrastructure in the neurosciences that is supported by NIH, there
remain several important opportunities for increasing the representation of underrepresented minorities and
other historically disadvantaged groups in brain science. There is a population of undergraduates with formal
training in the neurosciences (obtained via classroom-based work) who nevertheless have not had the
opportunity for a high-quality, longitudinal research experience. This same population frequently also lacks
access to the relevant mentorship required for success in applying to graduate school and then subsequently
for success in neuroscience research. Because longitudinal research experience is arguably one of the few
traditional admissions criteria that predict future success in graduate school, many applicants that lack such
experience are denied admission to graduate school on this basis alone. There therefore exists an educational
gap, one we propose to address here through PiNBAC, the Harvard Program in Neuroscience post-
baccalaureate program. Through the support of the Department of Neurobiology and the T32-funded Harvard
PhD Program in Neuroscience (PiN), PiNBAC was started in 2021 with an inaugural class of seven total
scholars; two of these scholars applied to graduate school this year (one will matriculate to Harvard, the other
to Yale), with the remaining five to apply in the fall. The initial iteration of PiNBAC included a substantial
research experience in which each scholar was asked to make an intellectual contribution to a project (rather
than solely serving in a technical support role), substantial mentorship both in applying to graduate school and
in the “hidden curriculum” of higher education and scientific training, integration of PiN graduate programming
to enhance PiNBAC training, and a specific longitudinal course to give each scholar space to reflect and learn
more about science from their peers. Informal feedback and early survey results suggest that the initial version
of PiNBAC has been a success: feedback from students and mentors reveals both that the program addresses
a clear gap in available educational resources, and that participants feel the program is effective at making a
difference. Here we propose to further develop PiNBAC, and to build on its strengths, by expanding the formal
neuroscience-specific curriculum offered to scholars. PiNBAC is rooted in an innovative data-driven
pedagogical approach that has been very successfully piloted in the last year. It is our hope that through this
application we can help to build the next generation of diverse leaders in the field."
11031540,"This MIRA application extends our decades-long research on nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and
how NMD factors can function in other aspects of cellular metabolism. NMD is a fundamental biological
process by which mammalian cells eliminate mRNAs containing a nonsense codon deriving a genetic or
acquired frameshift or nonsense mutation. NMD also eliminates an estimated one-third of mRNAs that cells
produce by routine mistakes made during gene transcription and/or mRNA production. Over the years, we
have worked to elucidate the molecular mechanism of NMD. As one of many outcomes, we have established a
“rule” that clinicians and researchers use to predict which nonsense codons result in recessively inherited vs.
dominantly inherited disease. We have also demonstrated how cells regulate the efficiency of NMD as an
adaptive mechanism during changing environments, e.g. during development, differentiation or drug
treatments. This application pursues our serendipitous finding that NMD is hyperactivated in fragile X
syndrome (FXS), which is the most common single-gene cause of intellectual disability and autism, affecting
1/4000 boys and 1/6000-8000 girls. We aim to understand how the protein that is missing in FXS functions via
interactions with other proteins and mRNAs to protect these mRNAs from translation and decay. We also aim
to decipher the mechanism by which the RNA-binding protein Staufen prevents a runaway immune response.
On another front, our long-time interest in mechanistic connections that extend from pre-mRNA splicing in the
nucleus to mRNA translation and decay in the cytoplasm will be extended to gene transcription and nuclear
mRNA decay. We have long been fascinated by the structural dynamics and functions of the largely nuclear
cap-binding heterodimer CBP80−CBP20, which binds co-transcriptionally to the 5'-cap of nascent pre-mRNAs.
While our past interests have focused on the role of CBP80−CBP20 in the pioneer round(s) of cytoplasmic
translation, during which we have shown exon-junction complex-mediated NMD occurs, we are now in pursuit
of understanding roles of CBP80−CBP20 in the nucleus. As one example, we are studying the mechanism by
which a master transcriptional co-activator of genes whose products regulate critical cellular processes
engages with CBP80−CBP20 so as to promote the expression of an understudied category of RNA
polymerase III-transcribed genes. In related work, we are studying connections between CBP80−CBP20 and
the little-understood, and so-called, nuclear cap-binding protein (NCBP)3 to elucidate the significance of our
finding that NCBP3 regulates newly made mRNAs from genes encoding proteins that function in mitochondrial
biology. These connections will be examined in skeletal-muscle cells in vitro and ex vivo, the latter using mice,
which should lend insight into the etiology and pathogenesis of many human diseases that include sarcopenia,
neuromuscular disorders, and cardiomyopathies. While are interests are broad, they are connected by the goal
to understand molecular mechanisms in health and in disease, with a focus on RNA metabolism."
11024014,"Abstract
Biomaterials-based strategies to modulate the immune responses has generated tremendous interest in the
past decade. Notably, biomaterials can not only be used for delivering drugs (synthetic or biologics) but by
themselves can modulate the function of different cells. Recently, we have demonstrated that the metabolite
alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) can be polymerized, and these polymers by themselves are able to suppress
activation of dendritic cells (DCs – forms the bridge between innate and adaptive immune system).
Interestingly, our preliminary data also demonstrates that delivery of PFK15, an inhibitor of PFKFB3 enzyme (a
key step in glycolysis) downregulates CD86 (co-stimulatory molecule) but maintains MHC-II (stimulatory
antigen presenting molecules) on DCs. Notably, glycolysis can control the function of activated DCs.
Therefore, glycolysis-inhibition mediated prevention of DC activation and simultaneous antigen expression, can
lead to antigen-specific immunosuppression responses. However, systemic inhibition of glycolysis has
inherent toxicity (clinical trials) associated with it, and have regulatory hurdles for clinical use. Therefore, the
main goal of this R01 program is to develop drug delivery vehicles that can deliver glycolysis inhibitors and
antigens locally to DCs, which will then systemically suppress inflammation. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that co-delivery of antigen and glycolytic inhibitor will induce DC tolerance and generate peripheral
antigen-specific suppressive T-cells, which will then promote reversal of tissue inflammation. This strategy will
be tested in a rheumatoid arthritis animal model. This hypothesis will be tested by performing experiments in
the following aims: AIM 1: Test if paKG formulations can generate long-term remission of RA by maintaining
metabolic homeostasis in joint tissues. AIM 2: Determine the effect of paKG formulations on cells associated
with arthritic tissue. AIM 3: Test the ability of paKG formulations to prevent progression of RA in K/BxN mice
AIM 4: Develop scaled paKG formulations for safety/toxicity profiles. This research will be an important
foundation in the development of technologies based on metabolic modulation of immune cells for autoimmune
disorder treatment. The results from this project will generate a sustained release platform, which after
application can prevent the progression of RA, or even reverse the damage."

The objective of the parent grant is to elucidate the normal physiological functions of the extracellular domain of
the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) in multiple cell types. Despite the known effects of the APP ectodomain on
cellular and cognitive functions and the potential applications to disease, the precise molecular mechanisms
mediating the function of the secreted APP ectodomain and the various forms of soluble APP generated by
ectodomain shedding are not well understood. Our approaches are designed to address the mechanistic gaps
in knowledge by leveraging our recent discovery that sAPP functions as a ligand for the GABA type B Receptor
(GABABR) and our recent identification of Phosphoglycerate Mutase Family Member 5 (PGAM5), a mitochondrial
serine/threonine protein phosphatase, as a novel candidate interactor of the APP ectodomain. One line of
research is aimed at elucidating the cellular responses of multiple cell types to sAPP and GABABR modulation,
identify signaling pathways downstream of the sAPP and GABABR interaction, and determine mechanisms
involved in the positive regulation of GABABR signaling by sAPP. The proposed research of the candidate in this
supplement is related to that line of research but is unique from the proposed studies in that he will examine the
effects and mechanisms involved in APP and GABABR signaling in developmental processes in neuronal cells,
which is an area of research that strongly aligns with the long-term research and career interests of the candidate.
The candidate will also expand on their background and interest in biophysics to establish intravital imaging
techniques and address the in vivo relevance of the APP- GABABR interaction."

The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomaterial-based technologies that can modulate the functions of
DCs and T-cells in the draining lymph nodes in the presence of systemically delivered metabolic inhibitors. The
hypothesis of this proposal is that polymeric biomaterials-based particles generated from central-carbon
metabolites (targeting DCs via phagocytosis) can restart glycolysis/TCA cycle in DCs in the presence of
metabolic inhibitors and will also induce robust vaccine responses in immunocompetent mice. Notably, we
have generated polymers of central-carbon metabolites from glycolysis and TCA cycle, which were able to
activate DCs even in the presence of metabolic inhibitors. Moreover, these particles were able to rescue the
metabolic inhibition, as observed by up-regulated extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) in bone marrow derived DCs. In vivo PEGS particle formulations delivering TRP-2
peptide (without any adjuvant), were able to prevent the growth of subcutaneous B16F10 tumors in the
presence of CB-839 a glutaminase inhibitor. Similarly, F16BP vaccine particles delivering TRP2 peptide
antigen along with poly(I:C) as adjuvant and PFK15, a glycolytic inhibitor, were able to reverse the growth of
subcutaneous YUMM1.1 tumors. The hypothesis of this proposal will be tested using the following specific
aims: Aim 1: Evaluate if F16BP particles induce antigen-specific long-term memory T cell responses in
immunocompetent mice in the presence of glycolytic inhibitor PFK15. Aim 2: Determine if PEGS particles can
induce antigen-specific long-term T cell responses in immunocompetent mice in the presence of glutaminase
inhibitor CB-839. Aim 3: Determine toxicity profile and maximum tolerable doses of vaccines. The results
obtained from these experiments will shed light on the effect of metabolic reprogramming on the efficacy of
vaccine therapy."
11011115,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The incretin-mediated potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) accounts for 50% of
postprandial insulin secretion and is essential for physiologic glycemic regulation. Upon nutrient stimulus, the
two principal incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) are secreted, respectively, from intestinal endocrine K- and L-cells and reach β-cells via the circulation,
where they bind their receptors, GIP receptor (GIPR) and GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) to amplify GSIS.
 While circulating incretin hormone levels are not impacted by T2DM, incretin effects on β-cell GSIS are
significantly diminished in T2DM patients. However, the precise mechanisms underlying diabetes-associated
blunting of incretin signaling in β-cells remain unclear.
 In T2DM, pharmacologic means to increase circulating GLP-1 levels improves GSIS and glycemic control.
In contrast, the GIP-mediated incretin effect is notably absent in T2DM; and pharmacologic means to increase
circulating GIP concentrations is not met with any GSIS improvement. The molecular mechanisms underlying
diminished response to GLP-1 and absent response to GIP in T2DM remain poorly understood.
 T2DM is in part linked to a chronic inflammatory state with increased levels of local and circulating
inflammatory cytokines that negatively impact insulin action in peripheral tissues and negatively impact the
endocrine pancreas. We have therefore examined the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are elevated in
T2DM on incretin signaling in islet -cells. Conversely, we have also interrogated the anti-inflammatory
cholinergic signaling system through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchR) in modulating incretin signaling.
 Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that TNFα - signaling through its receptor TNFR1 on β-
cells - activates the Ser/Thr G-protein receptor kinase 2 (GKR2) in a non-canonical manner to suppress Gαs-
activation and cAMP synthesis by ligand activated GIPR and by GLP-1R. Thus, our findings establish a
mechanistic link between inflammatory cytokines in T2DM with diminished incretin signaling in β-cells.
 Our preliminary studies also indicate that in a murine model of T2DM, stimulating the α7 nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAchR) reactivates GIPR signaling in β-cells to potentiate GSIS and improve
glycemia. Our mechanistic studies indicate that α7-nAchR signaling phosphorylates (TNFα-activated) GRK2 at
serine 670 to counteract its inhibitory effects on GIPR and GLP-1R-mediated cAMP synthesis.
 We now seek to expand our novel and exciting findings specifically a) to understand the role of TNFR1-
GRK2-mediated signaling on in vivo β-cell function, on GIP and GLP-1R action as well as how TNFR1 signaling
modulates α-cell gene expression in the context of obesity and T2DM; b) to specifically understand the role of
GRK2 in mediating resistance to β-cell incretin action in T2DM; and c) to understand the beneficial role of anti-
inflammatory α7-nAchR signaling in β-cells in the context of T2DM.
 We will use complementary in vivo and in vitro approaches to elucidate these important signaling pathways
in β-cells using newly generated unique mouse models as well as in vitro in human islets and β-cells.
 The outcomes of our studies will yield important insights into how inflammatory cytokines of T2DM impact
incretin signaling and β-cell function. Our proposed studies will also provide new insights into the effects of
nicotinic acetylcholine signaling in β-cells. Finally, our studies identify potentially new receptor targets with the
potential to ameliorate β-cell dysfunction in T2DM.

Vestibulodynia (VBD) is a chronic pelvic pain condition that affects 1 in 6 reproductive aged women, yet remains
ineffectively treated by standard trial-and-error approaches. Our group has identified two distinct VBD subtypes
that may benefit from different types of treatment: 1) VBD peripheral (VBD-p) subtype characterized by localized
pain specific to the vulvar vestibule, and 2) VBD central (VBD-c) subtype characterized by pain at both vaginal
and remote body regions. Preliminary data further demonstrate that VBD-p and VBD-c subtypes differ with
respect to patient reported outcomes (e.g., physical and mental health), production of cytokines (intracellular
proteins that regulate the activity of pain nerves and inflammatory processes), and expression of microRNAs
(small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression). Women with VBD-p exhibit normal
psychological profiles; balanced circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; and dysregulation in
microRNAs that regulate the expression of genes in estrogen pathways. In contrast, women with VBD-c report
decreased functional status and increased somatization; increased pro-inflammatory but not anti-inflammatory
cytokines; and dysregulation in microRNAs that regulate the expression of genes relevant to muscle, nerve, and
immune cell function. Based on these data, we hypothesize that two VBD-p and VBD-c subtypes will
preferentially respond to peripheral, central, or combined treatments and can be distinguished by cytokine and
microRNA profiles. These hypotheses will be tested in a phase III clinical trial that evaluates diverse treatment
strategies in women with VBD-p and VBD-c. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four parallel arms:
peripheral treatment with 5% lidocaine + 0.5 mg/ml estradiol compound cream, 2) central treatment with the
tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline, 3) combined peripheral and central treatments, or 4) placebo. The treatment
phase will last 4 months (with a 6-week titration at treatment initiation and 2-week taper period at 4 months), with
outcome measures and biomarkers assessed at 4 time points (0, 2, 4, and 6 months). First, we will compare the
efficacy of treatments in alleviating pain among women with VBD-p and VBD-c using standardized tampon
insertion with a numeric rating scale and self-reported pain on the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Next, we will
compare the efficacy of treatments in improving perceived physical, mental, and sexual health among women
with VBD-p and VBD-c using standardized questionnaires. Finally, we will measure cytokines and microRNAs
in women with VBD-p versus VBD-c using multiplex assays and RNA sequencing, and determine the ability of
these biomarkers to predict treatment response. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide new
insights into the mechanisms that drive pain perception and treatment response in two distinct VBD subtypes, and
determine the efficacy of peripheral, central, and combined therapies in reversing this pain. Such findings will readily
translate to improved patient care, permitting the millions of women with VBD, their partners, and clinicians to make
more informed decisions about pain management."

Epidemiological studies suggest that the consumption of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs)
derived from fish oil, mainly consisting of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5 n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA; 22:6 n-3), is associated with lower cardiovascular risk. However, interventional clinical trials aimed at
reducing cardiovascular incidents by supplementation with n-3 PUFAs have yielded inconsistent results. The
mechanisms responsible for the benefit of n-3 PUFAs on cardiovascular risk are still not completely understood.
Mounting evidence suggests that in addition to lowering triglycerides, the triglyceride-independent effects of n-3
PUFAs also contribute to their cardiovascular benefits. It is likely that differential effects of EPA and DHA also
contribute to the inconsistent clinical results. A head-to-head comparison of the biological effects of EPA and
DHA in a relevant population is urgently required. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that EPA and
DHA have differential effects on thrombogenesis in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia that are mediated by
the modification of HDL particle function. We propose a proof-of-concept clinical study comparing the biological
effects, particularly the thrombogenesis and antiplatelet effects, of an adequate dose of EPA and DHA head-to-
head in atherogenic dyslipidemia subjects. We will also examine the mechanism of how HDL particles mediate
these antithrombotic effects. Specific Aim1: To test the hypothesis that EPA and DHA differentially affect platelet
activation and thrombosis in vivo in subjects with atherogenic dyslipidemia. Human subjects with atherogenic
dyslipidemia will be randomized to dietary supplementation with four grams of either EPA or DHA n-3 PUFAs in
a single-blinded fashion for eight weeks. At baseline and after the supplementation, various markers of
thrombogenesis will be assessed. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that the effects of n-3 PUFAs on
platelets are mediated by the modulation of HDL particle function. At baseline and post n-3 PUFA
supplementation, HDL particle composition and HDL functions will be analyzed, respectively. We will further test
our hypothesis mechanistically in an HDL-deficient mouse model. HDL-dependent bioactive lipid production will
be characterized in both human and mouse studies. These studies will provide insight into a new paradigm of
understanding the puzzling clinical evidence of n-3 PUFAs and may ultimately lead to the development of novel
therapies to combat cardiometabolic risk."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is the current first-line treatment for human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) infection. Unfortunately, cART is implicated in various forms of HIV-associated neurological disorders. Pain
is the most common neurological complication that significantly reduces the quality of life of many people living
with HIV (PLWH), and emerging evidence suggests cART critically contributes to the development of pain in
PLWH. However, the mechanism by which cART promotes pain pathogenesis is still incompletely understood
and rationale-based effective adjuvant therapy is not available. In this project, we aim to elucidate the pathogenic
mechanism of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which are the cornerstone antiretroviral drugs
in cART regimens and induce neuropathic pain. Because PLWH on cART are commonly exposed to opioids and
HIV-1 gp120 protein that causes pain, we will also investigate the potential pathogenic interaction between
NRTIs and opioids or gp120. Our data show that separate administration of NRTIs, morphine, or gp120 to mice
causes pathological pain, and that the development of pathological pain induced by these agents shares
mechanistic properties with the activation of glial cells in the spinal dorsal horn. We hypothesize that NRTIs
promote pain pathogenesis in the neural circuit via glial activation and that gp120 and opioids can exacerbate
this condition. We will test this hypothesis by performing: (1) single cell transcriptomic analysis to characterize
the cellular neuropathogenesis induced by NRTIs in conjunction with opioids or gp120 (Aim 1), (2) whole cell
patch recording to characterize the pathologic pain neural circuitry induced by NRTIs with opioids or gp120 (Aim
2), and (3) behavioral testing to characterize pathological pain induced by NRTIs with opioids or gp120 (Aim 3).
Results from this research will help to define the potential detrimental impact of cART on the CNS and its
interactions with HIV and opioids.

11030862,"Project Summary/Abstract: Humans are extraordinarily visual animals, allocating a third of their cortex just to
seeing what is in front of them. Visual recognition is supported by a series of hierarchically organized brain
regions known collectively as the ventral visual cortex (VVC). Despite extensive research, we still lack a
computationally precise understanding of how visual information is represented and transformed over stages of
the human VVC. A key barrier has been the limitations of methods like functional MRI (fMRI) which make it
difficult to test a large number of experimental stimuli. The research in this proposal will overcome this barrier by
collecting fMRI responses to hundreds of stimuli, and analyzing these data using deep neural network based
computational models and human interpretable algorithms such as image-synthesis and saliency mapping. In
Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will focus on the category-selective regions of the VVC, that respond preferentially to
images of faces (fusiform face area), scenes (parahippocampal place area), and bodies (extrastriate body area).
I will develop and use new computational methods together with closed-loop experiments to address open
questions such as: Is the hypothesized selectivity for these regions even correct? What is represented in the
intermediate stages of processing? Are there functionally distinct regions within the category-selective regions?
In Aim 2 (R00 phase), I will venture into the ~65% of VVC that lies outside the category-selective regions. I will
develop and apply new data-driven clustering to divide these regions into their native components, and
characterize them individually. Together, this endeavor will reveal the computational and neural basis of visual
recognition in humans with an unprecedented precision. My background in experimental and analytical methods
in monkey and human vision puts me in a unique position to accomplish this proposal which requires a seamless
integration between neuroimaging experiments and state-of-the-art computational modeling. The proposed work
will be initiated in the lab of Prof. Nancy Kanwisher (mentor). During the K99 phase, I will continue to be mentored
by Prof. Kanwisher, and will also advance my expertise with computational modeling under the supervision of
Dr. Jim DiCarlo (co-mentor), and ultra-high-resolution 7T neuroimaging with Dr. Jon Polimeni (collaborator). This
proposed plan will significantly augment my theoretical understanding and experimental abilities, and put me on
a path to independence."

Mitigation of damage caused by total body irradiation (TBI) or partial body irradiation (PBI) requires targeting
the acute gastrointestinal syndrome. Parenteral administration of radiation mitigators for the hematopoietic
syndrome may also ameliorate the gastrointestinal syndrome; however, drug delivery to the intestinal crypts is
ineffective due to irradiation damage to the intestinal microvasculature. We have demonstrated that oral
administration of engineered Lactobacillus reuteri, which produces and releases IL-22 (LR-IL-22), ameliorates
the TBI induced acute gastrointestinal syndrome. Effective mitigation is associated with preservation of Lgr5+
intestinal crypt stem cells and their regeneration capacity. We will now establish the underlying mechanism of
radiation mitigation by LR-IL-22, and will develop a microbial therapeutic with enhanced safety and efficacy.
Preliminary data demonstrate that LR-IL-22 restores irradiation-induced suppression of gene transcription in
Lgr5+ stem cells. TBI reduces expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in the intestine and its
generation of downstream products, including IL-22. We hypothesize that TBI-induced intestinal damage will
be further mitigated by combining LR-IL-22 with a probiotic (R2Ic) that naturally induces AhR to stimulate
recovery of intrinsic IL-22 levels. Furthermore, we will establish that priming the release of IL-22 by our
engineered probiotic increases therapeutic efficacy and the biological and environmental safety profiles. The
First Specific Aim tests the hypothesis that LR-IL-22 restores radiation suppressed transcription at the
molecular level in Lgr5+GFP+ intestinal stem cells. The Second Specific Aim tests the hypothesis that the
activation of AhR in irradiation weakened cells by LR-IL-22 is further boosted by oral gavage of R2Ic to induce
intrinsic IL-22 production. The Third Specific Aim addresses the need to provide biological and
environmental containment of LR-IL-22, while improving the therapeutic efficacy. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will lead to translation of LR-IL-22 to the National stockpile, as an effective mitigator of the
acute radiation induced gastrointestinal syndrome."

Osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis (OOKP) or Tooth-in-Eye surgery is an exceptional procedure that can save
severely injured corneas. The OOKP procedure is effective and capable of treating corneas after multiple corneal
transplantation failures, or when the cornea is severely damaged by Stevens–Johnson syndrome, pemphigoid,
chemical burns, trachoma and multiple corneal graft failure.
The success rate in OOKP is high, however, it is an aggressive procedure, time consuming and involves partial
sacrifice of the patient's oral cavity. This proposal aims to simplify this surgery by making a novel OOKP synthetic
prosthesis.
At the first stage of the OOKP surgery, a patient's tooth and surrounding tissue are harvested to make an
autograft prosthesis called an osteo-odonto-lamina into which an optical cylinder is placed.
This construct is then implanted into a submuscular pouch for 2–4 months to be vascularized. At the second
stage of the surgery, the vascularized osteo-odonto-lamina is inserted into the eye to act as a frame for holding
a PMMA optical cylinder.
In this proposal, we build a special keratoprosthesis for the OOKP surgery as a replacement of the osteo-odonto-
lamina so the surgeons do not need to harvest teeth and surrounding jawbone of the patients.
For this purpose, we will follow the general design we have proposed in our recently issued patent. Although the
design and idea of the keratoprosthesis have already been proposed in our patent, it has not been produced,
and the details of the construct are yet to be configured in this proposal. More specifically, we are going to figure
out the material, density, porosity, and pore-size of the different parts of the prosthesis in a way to mimic the
details of the natural osteo-odonto-lamina structure, and particularly mimic the features of it that are accountable
for the success of OOKP surgery. We will use a titanium alloy and 3D-printing technique to fabricate this
keratoprosthesis.
By considering our criteria for mimicking such construct, we will make 18 samples. They will go through a full
physical, mechanical, and in vitro characterizations to find the most optimized synthetic OOKP keratoprosthesis.
In sum, OOKP surgery is a multi-disciplinary, labor-intensive, and invasive procedure requiring both dental and
ophthalmology expertise. Through the use of our new prothesis, the OOKP procedure can eliminate one very
aggressive stage of the surgery that harms patients and can reduce the overall length of the treatment by a few
months. It will considerably enhance the treatment of patients with severely injured corneas."
11013252,"Lesions to articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone eventually lead to osteoarthritis, a debilitating
disease with no cure. A successful therapy will need to promote tissue regeneration, support integrative repair,
and protect the surrounding tissue from further degeneration. The overarching goal for this project is to develop
a mechanically competent, stem cell-based regenerative approach to treat osteochondral (OC) defects. During
the initial funding period, our team developed an OC-mimetic hydrogel with a design that decoupled the load-
bearing (i.e., structural) component from the soft cellular biomimetic component. This allowed us to create a
functionally graded, stiff structure with cartilage-matched mechanical stiffness, while creating soft cellular niches
that supported mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation. Building from key in vitro milestones, this renewal
aims to translate the OC-mimetic hydrogel in vivo. We will test the hypothesis that the OC-mimetic hydrogel
induces rapid and targeted differentiation of exogeneous MSCs in vivo, enabling their direct participation in OC-
tissue regeneration while simultaneously protecting and supporting integration with the surrounding tissue. A
new feature of our design is a cement line-mimetic within the structural support that similar to the native
cement line will be impervious to cell migration across the cartilage-bone interface, but pervious to nutrient
transport. This will protect the MSCs in the cartilage layer, enabling their rapid differentiation and contribution to
regeneration. We will test the overarching hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim1, we will identify
mechanotransduction pathways that differentially control MSC fate in the OC-mimetic hydrogel, which will
allow us to establish a mechanistic understanding of the physiochemical cues that achieve robust MSC
differentiation in a dynamic environment with loading. In Aim 2, we will determine MSC fate in vivo within the
OC-mimetic hydrogel after implantation in a rat OC defect model by tracking differentially labeled MSCs isolated
from DsRed+ and GFP+ rats. This aim will confirm MSC fate and their direct and indirect contribution to OC-tissue
regeneration. In Aim 3, we will create a structural support that undergoes surface degradation to maintain its
mechanical properties. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this fully degradable and mechanically
competent OC-mimetic hydrogel using three models of increasing complexity: an OC explant defect model to
monitor the health of and integration with articular cartilage adjacent to the defect as the support structure
degrades; a rat OC defect model for longitudinal studies to monitor in vivo degradation of the structure
concomitant with tissue regeneration and integrative repair; and, testing in a pre-clinical animal (swine) model.
At the conclusion of this project, we expect to have (1) advanced our fundamental understanding of the
mechanotransduction pathways in MSCs and their fate in vivo and (2) established a mechanically competent
and degradable OC-mimetic hydrogel that achieves OC-tissue regeneration and integrative repair, while
maintaining joint health."
11030888,"Project Summary: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) continues to be a significant factor in global morbidity and
mortality. Patients experiencing repetitive acute kidney injury (AKI) are predisposed to CKD. Despite
discoveries of novel biomarkers and increasing awareness of kidney health, the prevalence of CKD and end-
stage kidney disease (ESKD) continues to rise. To date, the lack of therapeutic options halting progression
from AKI to CKD still represents an unmet need. Our preliminary data suggest while activation of complement
component 5 receptor 1 (C5aR1) promotes renal tubular epithelial cell (RTEC) damage, C5aR1 signaling on
myeloid cells may confer renoprotective effects ameliorating AKI. This project will determine the roles of C5a-
C5aR1 axis activation in 1) RTEC cellular senescence and kidney fibrosis (Aim 1), and in 2) myeloid cells
responsible for AKI pathogenesis (Aim 2). These aims will test our central hypothesis that C5aR1 activation in
kidney resident macrophage (KRM) mitigates the acute phase of AKI, whereas C5a-C5aR1 signaling in RTEC
mediates their cellular senescence with subsequent CKD progression and fibrosis. Our findings will lay the
fundamental knowledge of the potential clinical use of complement-regulating therapies for kidney
diseases. Candidate and Training: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Mon-Wei (Sam)
Yu's career development into an independent basic scientist in the fields of complement biology and kidney
diseases by using novel murine models and immunological approaches. Dr. Yu's proposed training activities
are in four areas: 1) Establish innovative scientific questions and design appropriate experiments to answer
those questions; 2) Attain the necessary techniques, especially in the immunology field, to perform
experiments; 3) Gain training and experiences for big data analysis, and 4) Refine the skills for grantsmanship

11030909,"Efferocytosis by bone marrow stromal cells and bone aging
Pre-clinical studies show that senescent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal (a.k.a. stem) cells (MSCs)
and osteolineage cells contribute to age-dependent bone loss and bone marrow failure. Therefore, the
identification of novel mechanisms that accelerate MSC dysfunction could enable mechanistic approaches to
degenerative processes that impact the skeleton. While a handful of in vitro studies previously demonstrated
MSCs’ ability to phagocytose apoptotic cells (efferocytosis), matrix, pathogens and metal particles, whether
efferocytosis by MSCs impacts their function and bone maintenance is not known. We found that bone marrow
MSCs indeed efferocytose apoptotic neutrophils in vivo. Preliminary data from adult mice with transgenic
overexpression of the direct phosphatidyl serine receptor BAI1 in MSCs suggest that chronic low dose
enhancement of efferocytosis by MSCs may be beneficial to skeletal health. We also found that, in aged mice,
efferocytosis by MSCs is significantly increased. Moreover, transcriptional and functional preliminary data in vitro
suggest that excessive efferocytosis by MSCs decreases osteoblastic differentiation and promotes senescence.
Since efferocytosis is accompanied by oxidative stress and mitochondrial changes, which we previously found
to modulate osteoblastic differentiation, mitochondrial disruption may mediate functional changes in MSCs that
clear high numbers of apoptotic cells. Based on these data, we hypothesize that phagocytosis by MSCs is an
important component of osteoimmunology; however when pathologically increased in aging, it causes MSC
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and senescence, thus contributing to bone loss. To test this, using
aging and genetic models, we will 1) determine the mechanism of MSC efferocytosis; 2) define the pathogenic
mechanisms induced by efferocytosis in MSCs; and 3) establish the role of efferocytosis by MSCs in normal
osteoimmunology and in aged bone. Defining the role of facultative phagocytosis/efferocytosis in metabolic
changes and senescence in MSC and their relevance to human aging and disease will provide innovative,
actionable strategies impacting degenerative disorders that target the skeleton."

Homologous recombination reshuffles genetic information between parental chromosomes generating genetic
diversity and driving evolution. Recombination predominantly occurs at a set of genomic locations called
recombination hotspots. In most mammals, including humans, hotspot locations are defined by the sequence-
specific binding of the PRDM9 protein, which trimethylates lysine 4 of the histone H3 at the sites where
recombination is later initiated. In Prdm9 knockout mice DSBs are targeted to gene promoters and enhancers,
which also carry the H3K4 trimethylation mark. Therefore, PRDM9 directs recombination away from functional
genomic elements. This role is important as data indicate mutagenic effects of recombination both on the local
nucleotide level and in gross chromosomal rearrangements. Nevertheless, some species do not have the
Prdm9 gene or have lost canonical Prdm9 through evolution. In most of such species, recombination hotspots
still exist, but they form at the H3K4me3-marked gene promoters and other genomic regions with accessible
DNA. In contrast, nematodes and dipterans do not have recombination hotspots. Why promoters are not
targeted by the DSB machinery in such species is not understood. Surprisingly, in this study we found that in
marsupial Monodelphis Domestica, hotspots actually avoid promoters, even though they tend to cluster rather
uniformly withing gene bodies. Finding the mechanism driving such an unusual distribution of recombination
events is the current goal of this study. In addition to the prominent role of homologous recombination in
evolution, recombination per se is essential for proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during
gametogenesis. Recombination defects are invariably associated with infertility, miscarriage and aneuploidy-
related birth defects. Defining the mechanisms that control genetic recombination will eventually aid in
detection, prevention and/or treatment of aneuploidy-related infertility and birth defects."

Homology-directed DNA repair (HDR) is a universal, conserved mechanism for the repair of DNA double-
strand breaks and the maintenance of DNA replication forks. While HDR is relatively well understood in
bacteria and lower eukaryotes, glaring knowledge gaps remain in the appreciation of mechanisms in
mammals, because of greatly added complexity including myriad factors that are unique. Notably, several
breast and ovarian tumor suppressors, including BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2, and PALB2, have been implicated
in HDR in mammals, and emerging evidence provides glimpses of the roles that they fulfill. However, a holistic
understanding the molecular mechanisms of human HDR has been hampered by the immense challenge of
expressing and purifying these very large proteins and protein complexes for mechanistic workup. My
laboratory has overcome this challenge, allowing us to demonstrate the pivotal role of BRCA2 in complex with
its obligatory partner DSS1 in facilitating the assembly of catalytically active filaments of the RAD51
recombinase on single-stranded DNA and to reveal a late role of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex in HDR via the
promotion of RAD51-mediated DNA strand invasion. In this proposal, we aim to fill several knowledge gaps
regarding how BRCA1-BARD1, BRCA2-DSS1, and PALB2 synergize in two distinct stages of the HDR
process. Specifically, we will apply an integrated approach that encompasses reconstitution biochemistry,
single-molecule biophysics, structural biology, DNA fiber analysis, and advanced cell biology to interrogate
how the aforementioned tumor suppressors and their partner HDR factors, such as RAD54, help promote the
assembly of the RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament and the catalysis of DNA strand invasion within the
context of chromatin. The results from our work will bring molecular and mechanistic clarity to RAD51-
dependent HDR and the preservation of stressed DNA replication forks in human cells."

11031852,"Dynamic and correct protein synthesis by the ribosome is essential to cell’s normal function, especially in muscle
and neuron cells. The intricate ribosome internal structure and elongation factors achieve fast and faithful peptide
elongation cycles at the expenses of GTP energy. However, mechanism and cellular level regulations of this
process in healthy and diseased cells are still not clear. For example, elongation errors due to amino acid
misincorporation and frameshifting are the fundamental causes for neuron degenerative diseases,
cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and viral infections. Regulation of the human ribosome translocase eEF2 via
phosphorylation is the only known normal functional modification, making the eEF2 kinase an extremely popular
drug target. However, how this modification affects the translocation is unclear. Similarly, mutations in eEF1, the
other elongation factor, causes congenital epilepsy and intellectual disability with unclear mechanism. In addition,
dynamic RNA modifications are connected with translation regulation and antibiotic resistance. We will tackle
these problems with super-resolution force spectroscopy (SURFS) that can directly measure the ribosome
toeprinting on the mRNA at both sides flanking the ribosome, and reveal the mechanical force’s role in this
movement. The outcome of this proposal is to prove the hypothesis of ribosome’s “inchworm-like” translocation
model that was proposed during the first supporting period. It will fill the current knowledge gap regarding
mechanical force’s role in translocation fidelity, reveal new therapeutic targets for related diseases, and generate
a new tool for biophysical research. Our research is unique because force in ribosome translation is only recently
confirmed and its mechanistic role is largely unknown. To our best knowledge, FIRMS and SURFS are the only
approaches that can probe both force and movement of ribosome. The aims are: 1) reveal the relationship
among power stroke, frameshifting, and kinetics using disease-causing mutations in elongation factors. EF-G
and EF-Tu’s mutations at the GTP binding pocket and EF-G’s domain IV loops interacting with tRNA are the
subjects. 2) investigate the roles of mRNA modifications, codon repeats, and antibiotics in translocation. Among
the 27 mRNA residues covered inside the ribosome, specific locations interact with the rRNAs to serve as the
brakes for reading frame maintenance. Modifications and antibiotic bindings at these locations are the focus in
this aim. In addition, how G-quadruplexes of repeating mRNA sequences induce frameshifting and alter the
kinetics will be revealed. 3) develop multiplex time-resolved SURFS. During the previous funding period, we
developed force-induced remnant magnetization spectroscopy (FIRMS) to resolve different reading frames and
determine the power strokes of EF-G and its modifications. Toward the end of the first funding period, SURFS
technique was developed that integrated acoustic radiation force with FIRMS to achieve five-fold better force
resolution. In this aim, SURFS will enable automatic multiplexed measurement with time-resolution. Therefore,
we will advance this technique with more efficient and precise measurements for force and translocation steps."
11013971,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Enhancers are an important class of noncoding loci regulating gene expression and play important roles in
modulating diverse phenotypes and disease states. However, our understanding of the role of enhancers in
phenotypic evolution is limited and we lack a detailed understanding of the relationship between sequence
change within and between species, epigenetic states and variation in enhancer function. Moreover, we have
few statistical models that allow researchers to connect evolutionary changes in enhancer sequences within
and between species to phenotypic variation, and we often cannot unambiguously determine the causes of
observed changes in evolutionary rate of enhancers along lineages. Finally, most studies of enhancer
evolution thus far have studied only small numbers of enhancers and genome-wide assays of enhancer
variation and function are rare. Here we propose to develop statistical models linking phylogenetic patterns of
enhancer evolution with phenotypic variation between species, and to leverage within-species variation across
multiple species – “comparative population genomics” – to disentangle the sources of rate changes observed
in enhancers across species. We will also functionally test diverse enhancers on a large-scale, using the
developing fore- and hindlimb of volant and flightless birds as a model of development and gene expression.
Specifically, in Aim 1 we will extend a recently developed Bayesian phylogenetic model for detecting rate
changes in noncoding DNA, phyloAcc, to improve its biological realism by incorporating stochastic gene tree
heterogeneity and the ability to associate sequence change with both binary and continuous traits. Building on
a novel data set of comparative gene expression and chromatin states across multiple species and
developmental stages, we will also develop methods to associate genome-wide variation in chromatin states
between species with binary and continuous traits. In Aim 2 we will develop additional statistical models to
leverage information from sequence variation within species to better understand the evolutionary forces
contributing to rate variation in noncoding DNA observed between species. The models developed in Aims 1
and 2 will be refined and made available to the broader community in a user-friendly format for use on diverse
systems and species. In Aim 3 we will functionally validate large numbers of candidate enhancers identified in
Aims 1 and 2 as having evolved new functions or found in altered chromatin states in the developing fore- and
hindlimb of volant and flightless birds. Using high-throughput assays in chicken, emu and other birds we will
study the relationship between within- and between-species sequence variation of enhancers and their ability
to drive gene expression. Together these aims will provide a number of tools that will benefit the community of
researchers using comparative genomics to understand links between genotype and phenotype, and will
extend the kinds of phenotypic traits and genomic signatures that will inform this emerging paradigm."
11017535,"Abstract: Squamous cell cancer of the anus (SCCA) is increasing in the aging cohort of people living with HIV
(PWH), who are at 40-80x higher risk for SCCA than the general population. The increase in invasive anal cancer,
and its precursor, high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), has led to a focus on prevention in PWH.
The Anal Cancer HSIL Outcomes Research study demonstrated immediate anal HSIL treatment decreases
invasive cancer incidence rates, providing the impetus for increasing screening capacity with anal colposcopy or
high resolution anoscopy (HRA). Unfortunately, HRA-guided histologic diagnosis is resource intensive and
inefficient, requiring extensive clinician training, separate patient visits for diagnosis and treatment, and biopsy-
associated patient discomfort, an issue exacerbated by the poor specificity of HRA-directed biopsies. There is
a great need to develop novel, low cost, point-of-care approaches that are responsive to global health
care contexts and which offer an accurate, real-time “optical biopsy” thus transforming the current
standard of practice by decreasing unnecessary biopsies, reducing loss of follow up, and facilitating a
“see and treat” approach in low- and high-resource settings.
 In our current R01, we successfully optimized and validated a novel, low cost (<$2,500) Mobile High-
Resolution Micro-Endoscope (HRME) which provides “optical biopsies” of HRA-identified abnormal areas by
delineating the cellular and morphologic features of neoplasia. Our team also (a) produced a faster-frame capture
(70 frames/sec) HRME, (b) developed automated, machine learning-based algorithms for image interpretation,
and (c) showed that this fast and artificial intelligence (AI)-based (FAST) HRME had comparable sensitivity (91%
vs 91%) and significantly improved specificity (87% vs 52%, p=0.0001) for HSIL detection, using gold-standard
histology (AUC of 0.96).
 In this competitive renewal, we will develop computer-assisted AI-based identification of HRA-suspicious
areas to enhance FAST-HRME to create a fully automated AI-based HRA-HRME platform and evaluate this in
diverse clinical environments in USA and Brazil to facilitate implementation. Our hypothesis is this HRA-HRME
technology will improve the efficiency, accuracy, and clinical impact particularly for novice HRA providers in
the community by facilitating the identification of HRA-abnormal areas, providing real-time “optical biopsy” with
HRME, and enabling real-time decision making (treat vs. biopsy vs. no biopsy) regardless of provider skill level.
Finally, we will assess the barriers and facilitators for adoption and utilization of the AI HRA-HRME in diverse
global health settings to facilitate utilization. Successful results can be applied to other cancers (oral, cervix,
skin, stomach, etc.) requiring community-based screening and surveillance."

The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide, with an estimated 463 million cases in 2019 (31 million
cases in the United States). Patients with diabetes suffer from a number of common and morbid complications,
including peripheral neuropathy (PN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In addition to diabetes, the metabolic
syndrome (MetS) has been firmly established as a risk factor for these complications. Unfortunately,
interventions that improve metabolic risk factors for patients with long-term metabolic impairment do not
completely prevent or reverse diabetic complications, which may be the result of the current timing of
interventions after metabolic risk factors have been present for many years. Importantly, very few studies have
assessed the longitudinal association between the MetS and diabetic complications; therefore, the ideal timing
of these interventions is unknown. Metabolic profiles worsen as age increases and there is a substantial
amount of heterogeneity between patient metabolic trajectories. What remains unknown is how changes in
specific aspects of longitudinal metabolic profiles (such as rate of change, cumulative effects, and changes
during specific risk-periods) affect the progression of these complications. It is also unknown whether the onset
of diabetic complications can be accurately predicted using longitudinal metabolic trajectories. Machine
learning algorithms are flexible and powerful analytic tools for making predictions with complex data; therefore,
they offer an ideal approach to predict diabetic complications using complex characteristics from metabolic
trajectories. Our initial aims are to (1) determine the association between metabolic trajectories, PN, and CKD,
and (2) develop a machine learning algorithm to predict these complications with detailed characteristics of
metabolic trajectories. We will accomplish these initial aims using three complementary and powerful
databases with differential metabolic complexity and sample size. First, we will determine if metabolic
trajectories are associated with and are predictive of diabetic complications using two cohorts of Pima
American Indians that have undergone detailed longitudinal metabolic and diabetic complication phenotyping.
Then, to determine if our results can be implemented in a large-scale, integrated United States health system,
our final aim is to (3) develop a comprehensive machine learning algorithm to predict complications for patients
with diabetes using the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse database, which contains detailed
longitudinal medical information on over 3.1 million Veterans with diabetes from 1999-2021. Results from this
study will provide a novel understanding of the associations between metabolic trajectories and diabetic
complications. Ultimately, this data will inform future disease modifying interventions that reverse the metabolic
trajectories that are most predictive of diabetic complications."

 This SBIR Phase II project follows up on a highly successful Phase I project, where we
initiated the development of a new and innovative probiotic strain designed for the prevention of
kidney stones. This novel probiotic strain has an optimized ability to biodegrade oxalic acid.
About 75% of kidney stones consist of calcium oxalate (CaOx), and the root cause of CaOx
stones is an excessive urinary oxalate levels.
 There are few tools available to prevent CaOx stones, and none address this root cause.
Current kidney stone prevention approaches rely mostly on dietary modifications, an lean
heavily increasing fluid intake. However, adherence rates are commonly below 50%. Avoiding
oxalate-rich foods is also recommended to limit calcium oxalate stone growth, but again,
adherence rates are low, and a low oxalate diet is difficult to follow. There are few tools
available beyond dietary adjustments: Alkalinizing agents such as potassium citrate can reduce
stone recurrence, but can be surprisingly costly and often cause GI distress. Thiazide diuretics
increase urinary volume and reduce urinary supersaturation, but they come with frequent,
potentially life-threatening adverse effects such as hypokalemia.
 In contrast, our probiotic is a safe, cost-effective, innovative and promising strategy for
eliminating oxalic acid before it can be absorbed in the small intestine, with the goal being a
reduction in oxalic acid levels in urine.
 The main impact of this project will be the development of an accessible, affordable and
safe tool that does not have side effects seen with available treatment options. The proposed
SBIR Phase II project is designed to overcome remaining steps that need to be completed
before commercialization of our proposed innovation. Through Phase II Aims 1-4 we will
complete critical activities, including scale-up, confirmation of efficacy in a rat model of kidney
stones, and demonstrating safety and tolerability in order to obtain Generally Recognized As
Safe (GRAS) affirmation.
 The severe physical pain and suffering, the serious adverse psychological distress, and the
very serious adverse economic impact caused by kidney stones underscores the need to
explore new and innovative prevention approaches. Anticipated rises in the prevalence of
kidney stones and hyperoxaluria, along with the limitations of current treatments strongly
emphasize the societal demand for a hyperoxaluria treatment that is not only accessible and
affordable but also safe."
11007710,"PROJECT SUMMARY
HIV infection results in abnormal menstruation and alterations in circulating hormones. HIV infection is also highly
comorbid with drug use. Women who use drugs are at an elevated risk of HIV infection and show accelerated
HIV progression. In rodents, estrous cyclicity and cocaine-related behaviors are both regulated by the medial
preoptic area (mPOA) of the hypothalamus. The mPOA regulates gonadal hormone release which feeds back
onto the mPOA to regulate its activity. The mPOA regulates cocaine-related behaviors through primarily
GABAergic projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which modulates dopamine release in the nucleus
accumbens (NAc). Lesion of the mPOA disrupts estrous cycling and enhances cocaine-induced locomotion.
These mPOA lesion-induced changes are associated with increased cFos expression and dopamine release in
the NAc, together implicating mPOA in both estrous cyclicity and cocaine-related behavior. Our preliminary data
in the EcoHIV mouse model of HIV infection indicate disruptions in estrous cycle following inoculation with
EcoHIV. Further, EcoHIV infection enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, a model of cocaine-
related behavioral plasticity, and increased cocaine-induced cFos expression in the NAc. Thus, the mPOA may
represent a common site of dysregulation following EcoHIV infection, leading to alterations in both estrous cycle
and cocaine-related behavior. Consistent with this, we have observed that EcoHIV-infected female mice exhibit
attenuated cFos expression in the mPOA. This R21 proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that EcoHIV
infection dysregulates the mPOA estradiol system, leading to enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor
sensitization. Aim 1 will determine the effects of EcoHIV inoculation and cocaine exposure on estradiol levels
and receptor expression in the mPOA. Aim 2 will determine the effects of EcoHIV inoculation on engagement of
mPOA→VTA and VTA→NAc projections in cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Aim 3 will determine the
effect of chemogenetic activation of mPOA→VTA projections on cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization
following EcoHIV infection. It will also determine the effect of an estrogen receptor α antagonist on cocaine-
induced locomotor sensitization following EcoHIV infection. The results of these experiments will identify a
mechanism by which EcoHIV infection alters behavioral response to cocaine and the contribution of the
mPOA→VTA→NAc pathway to cocaine-related behavior following EcoHIV infection. Further, we will gain
significant knowledge of sex differences in the regulation of cocaine-related behavior by the hypothalamus."

Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 90% of kidney cancers in adults. Despite the
advancements made in cytokine, immune checkpoint, and targeted therapies, the rate of complete remission is
low and nearly all patients with metastatic disease experience disease progression. CAR-T therapy showed
clinically curative outcomes in hematological malignancies. However, there are multiple roadblocks for CAR-T
efficacy in solid tumors. Our company and founder have developed novel unbiased large/whole-genome T cell
CRISPR screening approaches and identified several universal modifications that enhanced CAR-T efficacy
against several tumor models in mice. We have developed a novel unbiased loss-of-function (LOF) screen,
enabled by site-specific, high-throughput massive knock-in engineering platform. Through this unbiased
evolution platform, we have identified a key gene PRDM1 mutation (exon 3 deletion) that modifies the epigenetic
state of T cells and significantly enhances immune characteristics of CAR-T cells, including increased T cell
proliferation, reduced exhaustion with improved memory and persistence, and high intra-tumor infiltration. In
addition, we have exploited the endocytic feature of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4)
cytoplasmic tail (CT) to reprogram CAR-T function and substantially enhance CAR-T anti-tumor activity in vivo.
CAR-T cells with CTLA-4 CT fused to the CAR C-terminus exhibit a progressive increase in cytotoxicity under
repeated stimulation, accompanied by reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines.
ENPP3 is highly expressed in >90% RCC cases, and expression is highly restricted in normal tissues and
typically located apically in normal tissues and thus relatively inaccessible to CAR-T. We have generated and
screened multiple scFvs against ENPP3, developed ENPP3 gene-enhanced CAR-Ts, and showed promising in
vitro and in vivo results in our kidney cancer animal model with no toxicity.
The goal of this proposal is to evaluate whether the combination of CAR-CTLA4 tail fusion and PRDM1-exon 3
knockout (KO) results in superior CAR-T–activity against RCC tumor relative to either modification alone, and to
nominate the best performing ENPP3 CAR-T plus genetic modification(s) for IND and Phase 1 clinical trials.
Specifically, we will evaluate ENPP3 CAR-Ts with PRDM1 △exon3 alone (CIB-101), CTLA4 tail fusion alone
(CIB-102), both PRDM1 △exon3 + CTLA4 tail fusion (CIB-103), and CAR-T with no modifications (CIB-100). We
will select our final clinical candidate by performing side-by-side in vitro as well as pre-clinical in vivo evaluation
of CIB-100 to 103 (aim 1, phase1), followed by process development, GMP manufacturing, pre-clinical
development, and IND filing. These studies include efficacy, PK/PD, GLP toxicology, and pathology analysis on
our final autologous ENPP3 CAR-T clinical candidate (aim 2, phase 2). By the end of the study period, we
anticipate having selected our final ENPP3 CAR-T and genetic modification(s), performed IND-enabling studies
and GMP manufacturing, and being ready for the first Phase I clinical trial of our superior lead autologous CAR-
T products in patients with advanced RCC.

11019618,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), most common form of dementia, affects over 55 million people worldwide. Numbers are expected to double every 20 years unless improved treatments are developed. AD is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau, but recently approved treatments targeting amyloid deposition show limited effectiveness. Therefore, it is critical that treatments are developed that target multiple aspects of AD and related dementias (ADRD). Small vessel cerebrovascular disease is now thought to contribute to many ADRD cases. However, no treatments that target cerebrovascular health in ADRD are available. Therefore, in response to RFA-NS-24-027 (VCID Center Without Walls [CWOW] for Understanding and Leveraging Small Vessel Cerebrovascular Disease Mechanisms in ADRD), we propose to establish The Jackson Laboratory (JAX)/Emory University/Columbia University/Rush University VCID CWOW to prioritize novel therapeutic targets for vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). We will focus on understanding factors mediating cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA: the deposition of amyloid in small vessels), including interactions with tau pathology and APOE genotype. APOE4 is the greatest genetic risk factor for ADRD and accelerates CAA. Despite the prevalence of CAA, the molecules that mediate its development remain to be elucidated. We hypothesize that targeting CAA, and the underlying cerebrovascular dysfunction and BBB breakdown, will prevent or slow neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in ADRD. To test our hypothesis, we will leverage expertise and resources available to the JAX/Emory/Columbia/Rush VCID CWOW. These include human samples and associated deep clinical data from the Religious Orders Study/Memory Aging Project (ROSMAP), a wealth of multi-omic data generated as part of the Accelerated Medicines Partnerships (AMP)- AD, and novel ADRD mouse models generated as part of Model Organism Development and Evaluation for Late-Onset AD (MODEL-AD). Our preliminary analyses have identified putative CAA-associated targets that are dependent on or independent of APOE4. However, small vessel-specific multi-omic datasets are lacking, hindering our sensitivity to identify cerebrovascular-specific mediators of CAA. Therefore, we will first generate and analyze vessel-enriched proteomic and single-nucleus RNA-seq datasets from ROSMAP samples showing variation in cognitive status, amyloid and tau pathology, CAA, and APOE genotype (Aim 1). We will then deeply phenotype our novel ADRD mouse model panel that shows a similar variation in CAA, APOE genotype, and tau pathology to that in the ROSMAP human samples. We will perform cognitive exams, magnetic resonance imaging, fluid biomarkers, whole-brain CAA mapping, and bulk and vessel-enriched proteomics (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform spatial transcriptomics and proteomics in human and mouse samples and integrate all data to prioritize novel vascular-specific candidates. The most promising of these will be validated in our mouse models (Aim 3). All data and resources will be made available through the AD Knowledge Portal and the JAX repository."
11019941,"PROJECT ABSTRACT. This competing renewal to Suubi4Her study (R01MH113486-Ssewamala, PI) will
examine the longitudinal impact of an evidence-based combination intervention combining economic
empowerment (EE) and family strengthening (FS) on HIV risk behaviors, cognitive, and mental health outcomes
among adolescent girls transitioning into young adulthood in poverty-impacted and HIV-burdened rural
communities in Uganda. Specifically, the study provides a unique opportunity to examine the longer-term effects
of an evidence-based combination intervention on HIV prevention (for adolescent girls who are HIV negative—
including PrEP use), and care and support continuum trajectories (of adolescent girls living with HIV – including
ART Adherence) during transition into young adulthood, a high-risk, yet understudied developmental stage in
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in SSA are still disproportionately
affected by high rates of HIV infection than their male counterparts. In 2022, 63% of all new HIV infections in
SSA were among women and girls. This increased risk of HIV infection among AGYW is exacerbated by poverty,
gender inequalities, stigma, discrimination, and disruptions to cognitive development trajectories that are
widespread across SSA. Yet, less than half (42%) of countries in SSA provide HIV prevention programs designed
specifically for AGYW. Alarmingly, communities with high HIV prevalence also report poor mental health,
including depression and suicidal ideation. This is particularly important during the transition from adolescence
to young adulthood as the brain is undergoing dramatic remodeling of dopaminergic neural networks. Adolescent
brain development enhances reward-seeking and peer influence, leading to risky decisions and mental health
issues without proper self-regulation, which improves in adulthood. Research indicates that poor mental health
during adolescence is more pronounced among girls than boys, underscoring the pressing need for girl-targeted
interventions during adolescence. The World Health Organization has recommended using multi-sectoral
approaches that address both structural and family-level issues. Approaches that concurrently address poverty
(e.g., via EE) and poor mental health (e.g., via FS) have a potential to concurrently reduce AGYW’s vulnerabilities
to HIV, and poor mental health and cognitive functioning. Our team recently concluded a 6-year (2017-2023, with
one-year no cost Extension), 3-arm cluster-randomized controlled trial, called Suubi4Her, that tested a
combination intervention guided by Asset Theory and family strengthening principles among 1260 school-going
adolescent girls aged 14-17 years at enrollment. In this competing renewal, we propose 3 aims: Aim 1: To
examine the long-term impact of the Suubi4Her intervention on young women’s HIV risk behaviors; Aim 2: To
elucidate the long-term effect of the Suubi4Her intervention on cognitive and mental health, and to explore
specific cognitive underlying factors that mediate the link between the intervention and reduced HIV risk; and
Aim 3: To examine the long-term cost-effectiveness of the Suubi4Her intervention."

FDA 510(k) clearance for our VERABANDTM medical device. Our 510(k) application is currently about half-way
though the FDA’s Substantive Review process. However, recently we received an unanticipated Additional
Information request from the FDA that required us to increase the scope of the project beyond what was originally
proposed by including a sleep-related assessment measure in the report we provide to physicians. Incorporating
this measure while ensuring our quality system and Device History File remains compliant with the FDA’s Quality
System Regulation, requires us to re-validate the software that generates the reports. The inability to complete
these tasks in a timely manner may result in rejection from the FDA review process. This application requests
additional support to complete the work required by the increased scope of the project so that we can successfully
complete the FDA review and obtain 510(k) clearance for the VERABANDTM technology. This will allow us to
advance to Phase II and onward toward commercialization."
11015530,"Project Summary
Low-back pain is the primary cause of disability across the world, and over 80% of workplace injuries also occur
to the lower back. Wearable robotic technologies, such as back-support exoskeletons (BSE), provide on-body
assistance to support and assist the trunk. BSEs are rapidly emerging as a potential intervention to reduce the
risk of occupational musculoskeletal disorders. However, user expectations for intimate body-worn devices such
as exoskeletons are likely to vary significantly across diverse user-groups representing different sex, age, and
racial characteristics. Current design/testing approaches that do not include diverse user perspectives in these
early stages of design and development of health interventions such as wearable robotics technologies can lead
to ethical challenges in equitable accessibility and technology acceptance. The ethical question addressed in
this proposal is whether user perceptions, technology acceptance, and health effects of exoskeletons
significantly differ across race, as this is currently undocumented in the literature. Our hypothesis is that important
race related differences among men and women in physical characteristics like anthropometry and strength, and
psychosocial factors influencing technology adoption, are likely to produce differences in user-acceptance and
health benefits of BSEs. We postulate that limited participant selection/representation in current exoskeleton
study designs is thus a critical ethical concern that may lead to health disparities if unaddressed.
A repeated-measures mixed-methods study, with a total of 80 participants representing men and women of
different racial groups, is proposed. Participants will trial two different BSEs and complete a standardized battery
of tasks. Our first specific aim is to document and analyze user-preferences and health effects of BSEs for
different racial groups. We will characterize race-related differences in physical design preferences, device
usability, opinions about BSE usefulness, and physical, psychological, and socio-cultural factors
promoting/inhibiting BSE use. We will also quantify racial differences in health effects of BSEs using
biomechanical measures of device effectiveness in trunk (primary) and hip/knee (secondary) body regions. Our
second specific aim is to explore race-related differences in factors that predict user acceptance of BSEs, using
a decision tree analysis to predict exoskeleton acceptance for each racial group.
Outcomes from this study will help document the ethical concerns in current exoskeleton design and evaluation
methods. Detailed data on anthropometric fit and user-preferences, evidence of their correlations with the
subjective and objective assessments of exoskeleton effectiveness, and feedback from our diverse stakeholder
group (advisory board) will be broadly disseminated, to guide future inclusive design and use of exoskeletons."
11018989,"Mechanism of Msp1 Mediated Protein Extraction from the Mitochondrial Membrane
As the center for oxidative phosphorylation and apoptotic regulation, mitochondria play a vital role in human
health. Proper mitochondrial function depends on a robust quality control system to maintain homeostasis of
the proteome (proteostasis). Declines in mitochondrial function and/or proteostasis have been linked to cancer,
aging, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. A poorly understood aspect of mitochondrial
proteostasis is the removal of membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer. This is due to the technical challenges
of reconstituting this process in vitro. We have overcome this technical barrier by developing a simple, but
powerful reconstituted system with the AAA+ (ATPase Associated with cellular Activities) protein Msp1.
Anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), Msp1 maintains mitochondrial proteostasis by
removing unwanted proteins from the lipid bilayer. Mutations in Msp1 or the human homologue ATAD1 lead to
compromised mitochondrial function, impaired fear conditioning, severe encephalopathy, and early death.
Despite its clear physiological importance, there are many important unanswered questions regarding Msp1
activity. How does Msp1 interact with other quality control components to maintain membrane proteostasis?
What is the full range of substrates extracted by Msp1/ATAD1? How is this regulated? These are particularly
pressing questions given that our collaborator, Jared Rutter (HHMI, University of Utah), has preliminary genetic
evidence that ATAD1 may regulate apoptosis by extracting BH3-only proteins from the OMM. We will use an
unbiased proteomic approach and our in vitro extraction assay to directly test this paradigm shifting hypothesis
and examine the molecular details for how this process is regulated. Because our reconstituted system
overcomes key technical barriers that have hampered previous attempts to study the extraction of membrane
proteins from a lipid bilayer, we will also utilize our system to draw foundational conclusions about how key
factors such as membrane fluidity, substrate structure, and ATP hydrolysis rates affect this essential cellular
process. This work will test an exciting new hypothesis for apoptotic regulation, provide a comprehensive
picture of Msp1/ATAD1 function in mitochondrial biology, and uncover new insights into the fundamental
process of membrane protein extraction."
11024121,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the human stomach of half the world and approximately a third of the
US population. H. pylori induces inflammation in all hosts and 10-20% of those infected will present with
severe disease including peptic ulcers and gastric adenocarcinoma. All H. pylori associated diseases
depend on the ability of this organism to establish a persistent infection and induce chronic inflammation.
Chronic inflammation in the stomach can lead to additional tissue changes including atrophic gastritis (loss
of acid-producing parietal cells), spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia (SPEM), intestinal
metaplasia (IM) and dysplasia that increase risk for adenocarcinoma. In the prior funding period, we
documented genetic adaptation of H. pylori strains to these tissue changes during chronic human infection
using a combination of whole genome sequence analysis, extensive phenotyping and molecular variant
tracking in clinical and population-based samples. We also showed that H. pylori actively modulates the
immune microenvironment through collateral delivery of proinflammatory cell envelope associated
metabolites during secretion of the toxin CagA via the Cag Type IV Secretion System (T4SS). These data
combined with clinical data revealing higher rates of metachronous cancer after early cancer resection in
individuals with sustained Hp infection lead us to rethink the model of H. pylori carcinogenesis beyond its
role as an initiator of inflammation. We propose that H. pylori promotes carcinogenesis through
continual remodeling of the tissue environment to create a favorable niche for long term persistence
and transmission. Thus, H. pylori disease is a by-product of the interaction between bacterial factors
necessary for establishing and maintaining infection for transmission and resultant host defenses. In our
renewal we propose to leverage these culture collections and newly developed mouse models to elucidate
the genetic mechanisms that drive these adaptations and the resultant phenotypic changes that accompany
metaplastic progression. Our specific aims are to 1) Identify adaptive genetic variation during chronic
infection and preneoplastic tissue changes, 2) Examine phenotypic changes during chronic infection and
adaptation to distinct niches and 3) Evaluate the interplay between the epithelial and myeloid compartment
in Cag T4SS dependent innate immune activation, bacterial control, and tissue remodeling.
Our study of the genes and mechanisms contributing to chronic colonization will identify the mediators of H.
pylori persistent infection. Our studies of genetic variation during stomach infection will show how these
mediators adapt during the chronic inflammation that leads to severe disease (cancer)."
11024172,"Parent Project Abstract.
Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) resulting from the transmission of drug-resistant pathogens affect hundreds
of millions of patients worldwide. Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn), a gram-negative bacterium, is notorious for
causing HAI, with many of these infections difficult to treat as Kpn has become multi-drug resistant.
Epidemiological studies suggest that gastrointestinal (GI) colonization of Kpn is a major reservoir through
which Kpn can cause disease manifestations either in the colonized host or transmit from host to host. This site
of Kpn colonization has not been the focus of previous studies as a tractable model of Kpn GI colonization, and
host-to-host transmission did not exist. We have recently developed a murine model that allows for the study of
Kpn mucosal (oropharynx and GI) colonization, shedding within feces, and transmission through the fecal-oral
route. Using an oral route of inoculation and fecal shedding as a marker for GI colonization, we show that Kpn
can asymptomatically colonize the GI tract of immunocompetent mice and modifies the host GI microbiota. We
premise that specific Kpn genes contribute to its GI colonization, and the products of these genes could serve
as novel targets for the prevention of the establishment of GI colonization. More recently, we used our murine
model to screen a library of Kpn random transposon mutants (In-seq) to identify the complete set of “GI
colonization” genes from a single isolate. A metagenomics sequencing analysis further identified bacterial
species and the metabolic pathways affected by Kpn in the GI tract. Herein, we will focus on two sets of
pathways identified through In-seq whose products allow Kpn to overcome colonization resistance provided by
the resident gut microbiota. Thus, in Aim#1, we will focus on the ethanolamine utilization pathway genes (eut)
of Kpn that allow it to utilize ethanolamine (EA), a byproduct of cellular membranes and diet in the gut that can
serve as an alternative nutrient source. Unlike many other enteric pathogens that contain a single eut operon,
Kpn has two genetically distinct eut operons. We will identify the role of each eut locus in EA metabolism and
determine the underlying molecular mechanism through which EA metabolism provides Kpn with a fitness
advantage against members of the microbiome. Aim#2 will take a different approach by focusing on the
contact-dependent killing machinery of the Kpn (Type 6 secretion system [T6SS]) in overcoming colonization
resistance provided by the resident microbiota. We will focus on the unique regulatory mechanism that
modulates the expression of Kpn T6SS in the GI tract and provide it with a selective and competitive
advantage against the resident gut microbiota. Results from these studies would provide us with a fundamental
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the establishment of GI colonization by an incoming
pathogen. These studies will also lay the groundwork for developing potential strategies to reduce the Kpn
disease burden."
11019433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Demographic and social forces that influence human behavior fundamentally shape the epidemiology of
infectious diseases, but are often left out from mathematical models of disease transmission. Our recent work
has added to the growing body of evidence that patterns of how humans come into contact with one another,
and the adoption of behaviors to reduce transmission, are highly heterogeneous across individuals and groups
in a population; these behaviors are strongly influenced by how societies are structured and the socio-
economic, environmental, and political contexts in which epidemics occur. These same forces influence
patterns of exposure, susceptibility, and health outcomes. Human behavior also varies temporally and
spatially, leading to heterogeneities in transmission across space and time and the possibility of dynamical
feedback between the disease environment and the socio-demographic processes that influence human
behavior. Driven by the public health imperative to understand and address disparities in infection exposure
and risk, I propose to develop new models and methods for understanding how demographic and social
processes – from individual heterogeneities to large-scale patterns of population behavior – drive infectious
disease risk across scales. Specifically, my research group will develop a generalized framework for jointly
modeling human behavioral changes and disease dynamics, with bi-directional feedback between behavior
and the disease environment. We will also build and validate models for incorporating data on human mobility
and aggregation at the population level, while incorporating other extrinsic drivers of transmission such as
climate. We will parameterize these models by leveraging detailed human behavioral data from an ongoing
survey platform as well as novel sources of mobile phone and digital trace data, and validate model results by
fitting to epidemiological geo-located time series data. Our modeling approach will be flexible and dynamic,
allowing us to adapt it for specific pathogens and regions of interest. The project results will provide a better
understanding of the complex interactions between human behavior and the fundamental biological processes
underlying disease transmission, with the ultimate aim of guiding control efforts, designing equity-focused
interventions, and improving our ability to predict and prepare for outbreaks.

 Supplement Application)
In this application, we seek a diversity research supplement to the parent award “HARNESSING
CELL
ALZHEIMER'S
SINGLE
EPIGENOME-WIDE PROFILING OF MYELOID CELLS TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST
FROM HIV-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION” (AG063846). The parent award
seeks to define the epigenomic landscape of myeloid populations in order to differentiate HIV Associated
Neurocognitive Disease (HAND) from Mild Cognitive Impairment state of Alzheimer's Disease (MCI-AD) in
individuals living with HIV on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). This diversity supplement will expand
the scope of research in Specific Aim 2 by enabling the addition of cellular immunophenotyping and MRI and
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) imaging in 5 subjects with HAND and 5 cognitively normal
subjects with HIV from the parent study, with plans to include subjects with MCI-AD in the future if additional
funding is secured. The main aims of the supplemental research project are 1) to investigate the
neurobiochemical features that may distinguish people living with HIV (PLWH) with HAND versus those without
HAND by measuring neurometabolites in the basal ganglia with 1H MRS and 2) to explore possible
relationships between neurometabolite levels and monocyte counts and phenotypes by linear regression. With
respect to the first aim, our hypothesis is that PLWH with HAND will have lower levels of both GSH and NAA in
the basal ganglia compared to PWLH without HAND, reflecting oxidative stress and greater neuronal injury,
respectively. We also hypothesize that total and intermediate type monocyte counts as well as CCR2 and
CD163 surface expression levels will be inversely correlated with GSH and NAA levels in PLWH, which would
further support monocytes being drivers of neuropathology in PLWH. In addition to funding a supplemental
research project, the NIA diversity supplement would provide a plethora of mentoring, training, and educational
opportunities to Dr. Hampilos at a critical point in his career. More specifically, the diversity supplement would
enable Dr. Hampilos to: 1) gain clinical and laboratory research experience in geriatric Neuro HIV and cellular
immunology through mentoring, coursework and “hands-on” training in immunophenotyping of peripheral
monocytes, which will be required for the proposed supplemental research project, 2) reinforce his radiology
training, by enabling Dr. Hampilos to analyze and interpret MRI and 1H MRS results, 3) provide opportunities to
enhance his presentation, writing skills, and grantsmanship and 4) generate key preliminary data which would
be used to apply for an NIA K22 Career Transition Award and an award from a private foundation in 2024
and/or 2025."
11010073,"ABSTRACT
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide unchallenged specificity compared to small molecules, representing a
growing market of 150+ billion dollars. Due to their structural complexity and poor stability, however, they remain
difficult to formulate at high concentrations, making intravenous (IV) delivery of mAbs the “gold standard”. IV
injections present major drawbacks, such as patient discomfort, long injection times, and high medical costs
associated with in-hospital administration. Subcutaneous (SC) delivery is a convenient route of administration
for large molecules, as it allows for rapid injections (seconds), requires minimal skills (self-injection), and allows
for systemic delivery. It remains an open challenge to reformulate mAbs to a SC form. Most mAbs requires large
dosage to be effective (>300 mg), and SC administration volumes are constrained to only 1-2 ml, hundreds of
times smaller than typical IV formulations
SC injections using hydrogel microparticles (HMP) offer a promising method for encapsulating and delivering
protein-based drugs. The composition, size, and mechanical properties of HMPs can be widely tuned to facilitate
their injection through needles for subcutaneous delivery. Alginate-based MP are becoming increasingly popular
due to their rheological properties and high biocompatibility. Additionally, the anionic nature of alginate enables
electrostatic entrapment of cationic proteins independently of the hydrogel porosity, making it a candidate for
hydrogel-based antibody formulations. However, current manufacturing technologies are limited to low
concentration of polymer (<5%), and low cargo loading, typically below 30 mg/ml for antibodies, resulting in
inadequate mechanical and therapeutic properties.
Through the support of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project, we aim at improving
clinical care of millions of patients by reformulating IV-delivered mAbs to a SC form, meaning patients could
administer their life saving drugs with reduced pain and discomfort, at a fraction of the cost.
We plan to leverage Acoustophoretic Printing (AP) to generate alginate MP to stabilize highly concentrated mAbs
formulation. This platform technology enables microparticle generation under modest shear forces without the
need for a hydrophobic carrier fluid, thereby protecting the valuable cargo and minimizing contamination. The
technology features: high bio-compatibility with no oil or surfactant required, making this technology particularly
suitable for large proteins; high concentrations of cargo (>100mg/ml), including alginate (>10%); low particle size
variation (coefficient of variation of 1-3%) reducing costly sieving steps, consistency in cargo encapsulation and
delivery - hence significantly improving Good Manufacturing Practices - even at extreme loading.
This project aims to: (1) Manufacture mAbs loaded hydrogel-based microparticles for SC delivery and
characterize them in-vitro, including encapsulation efficiency, release profile, and injectability. (2) Conduct In vivo
study to investigate safety, bioavailability, and bioactivity of the MP-based formulations in murine models."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Given rising levels of global stress, exacerbated by the pandemic, loneliness and mental health
problems are on the rise, adding to the burden of chronic diseases. Most health-oriented research takes a
harm-reduction approach, identifying and mitigating problems to reduce disease burden. Recent research has
demonstrated that a greater focus on emotional well-being may provide another critical strategy for reducing
disease burden and lead to significant improvements in population health. To advance the science and provide
the strongest evidence base for practice, greater development of research capacity for studying emotional well-
being (EWB) is needed. Core elements of emotional well-being (EWB)--hedonic, evaluative, and eudaimonic--
are associated with better healthspan and are hypothesized to play a causal role. Our overall aim is to create
a cohesive transdisciplinary network of scientists engaged in mechanistic intervention-relevant
research on EWB, with a specific focus on eudaimonia, and pathways by which EWB leads to healthy
longevity, including social connection, positive physiology, and healthy behaviors. We bring together three
leading institutions in EWB science, uniting UCSF (Epel, Mendes), Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and
Happiness at Harvard (Kubzansky) and UC Berkeley (Keltner, Simon-Thomas) and its interdisciplinary Greater
Good Science Center (GGSC), whose digital platforms reach several millions annually (researchers,
educators, health professionals). We will catalyze innovation and progress of mechanistic research on EWB by
fostering a scientific community focused on measurement and intervention.
 Our aims include Aim 1) Facilitating analysis of EWB and healthspan across national cohort studies
in 30 nations that are part of the Health and Retirement Study Family of Studies by harmonizing existing
measures of EWB (e.g., life satisfaction, eudaimonic well-being, positive affect) and supporting causal-
inference analyses; Aim 2) Promoting early stage intervention research by developing sensitive EWB
measures, and interventions that can increase EWB and drive change in relevant biobehavioral mediators
including positive physiology profiles, leveraging existing technology and validated biosensors that measure
autonomic nervous system and sleep; and Aim 3) Creating and disseminating valuable research resources
for studies of EWB and physical health, including a) making the harmonized EWB data across countries
publicly available and providing pilot funding and senior scientist expertise to support investigator time to use
the data; b) creating an expert consensus toolbox of EWB measures and methodology; and c) developing a
library of empirically-validated EWB interventions (building on UCB's repository). After 4 years, the EWB
network will have built strong research capacity and catapulted the field forward with innovative unifying
models, consensus measurement and intervention resources, and mechanistic pilot data. Transdisciplinary
collaborations will continue to generate key findings well beyond the network's input."
11009127,"Alterations of the mucosal barrier followed by microbial translocation are common in pathogenic HIV/SIV infections.
HIV-associated enteropathy was observed early in the pandemic, but a direct causative relationship between
HIV/SIV disease progression and gastrointestinal (GI) tract dysfunction is still to be proven. The triggers of HIV/SIV–
related gut dysfunction are poorly understood too. In pathogenic HIV/SIV infections, intestinal dysfunction occurs
following initial virus replication, CD4+ T cell depletion, epithelial damage and microbial dysbiosis, and these
phenomena cannot be dissociated, being difficult to dissect their relative contribution to disease progression.
Conversely, African green monkeys (AGMs), which maintain mucosal integrity throughout infection in spite of high
SIV loads, are ideal models to dissect the relative contribution of different potential mechanisms of the mucosal
dysfunction. During the previous funding period, we demonstrated that, in SIV-infected AGMs (a) Experimental
induced systemic T-cell activation in the absence of mucosal barrier damage is insufficient to drive disease
progression; (b) Prolonged and robust experimental CD4+ T cell depletion did not induce intestinal dysfunction in
the absence of inflammation; (c) Prolonged experimental chemical damage of the mucosal epithelium induced
progression only in a fraction of AGMs. As such, our results suggested that HIV/SIV disease progression is triggered
by factors that go beyond mucosal damage. Meanwhile, in other studies, we have shown that (a) Dysbiosis
correlates with gut dysfunction; (b) Gut microbiome changes induced by SIV in AGMs are markedly different from
those observed in PWH, and may help creating an anti-inflammatory environment, maintaining gut barrier and
preventing microbial translocation; (c) Dysbiotic flora translocate in progressive infections, and composition of the
translocated microbiome determines the immunologic outcome in PWH on ART. These observations are the basis
for our overarching hypothesis that microbiome is one of the main drivers of the outcome of SIV/HIV infection and
that induction of major and persistent dysbiosis in AGMs in the presence of a dysfunctional epithelium may induce
disease progression in this species. We will test this hypothesis in this competitive renewal to (a) Assess the impact
of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis on gut integrity, inflammatory status and SIV disease progression in AGMs; (b)
Assess the impact of dysbiosis occurring on a damaged gut (through DSS administration) in SIV-infected AGMs;
(c) Assess the impact of dysbiosis occurring on a permeabilized gut and a liver with impaired capacity of filtering
the translocated microbes (through alcohol administration). These experiments will directly assess the contribution
of GI dysfunction to HIV disease progression and the contribution of microbiome in driving gut dysfunction. Our
study is also highly significant in clinical settings and will establish the impact of antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in PWH
who consume alcohol excessively. Our results will thus inform future therapeutic and behavioral strategies aimed
at preserving gut integrity and avoiding disease progression."
11009129,"Abstract
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets the immune cells and weakens our defense against many
infections and cancer. If not treated, HIV can progress into acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Although antiretroviral therapy is a key component in HIV treatment and prevention, the rapid development of
drug-resistant HIV strains limits the selection of effective therapies available for patients. Thus, there is an urgent
need to identify alternative viral targets for inhibition. An essential yet poorly understood step in HIV replication
is Rev-response element (RRE) mediated nuclear export of the viral RNAs. During HIV infection, partially spliced
and unspliced viral RNAs need to be exported from the host cell nucleus to the cytoplasm to synthesize viral
proteins and assemble virions. Since incompletely spliced transcripts cannot be exported by the nuclear export
system, HIV uses a specific RNA sequence Rev Response Element (RRE) that are present in the incompletely
spliced viral RNAs that viral Rev protein specifically recognizes. Multimeric Rev proteins bind to the RRE
structure and recruit the nuclear export complex for cytoplasmic translocation of the viral RNAs. However, the
architecture of the highly specific RRE-Rev multimeric complex is unknown, largely due to the lack of the RRE
structure. We will use RNA-scaffold approaches that we developed and determine the structures of the initial
high-affinity Rev binding site of RRE (stem-loop II) and the full-length RRE. We will further characterize the
molecular interactions between RRE and Rev. Understanding the contribution of RNA structure that drive Rev
oligomerization will aid development of HIV therapeutics that target RRE and Rev interaction."
11009274,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The HIV latent reservoir (LR) is the major barrier to cure of HIV. The persistence of the LR in blood and tissues
in people living with HIV (PLWH) during ART is due to cellular proliferation of infected cells. Three mechanisms
are postulated to drive infected cell proliferation: integration of the provirus in or near genes associated with
cancer or cell proliferation; engagement of the infected CD4+ T cell receptor with its cognate antigen, leading to
proliferative bursts; and cytokine-mediated homeostatic proliferation. Recent evidence suggests that oncogene-
driven proliferation does not contribute significantly to infected cell proliferation. Meanwhile, antigen-driven
proliferation of infected cells appears to account for many or most of the most-highly expanded, or dominant,
infected cell clones. However, the degree to which homeostatic proliferation versus antigen-driven proliferation
maintains the overall reservoir is difficult to discern. Because infected cells are so clonal, shallow sampling
depths still reveal dominant clones (likely maintained by antigenic stimulation) while underestimating the extent
of the non-dominant clones (the ‘tail’ of the clonality distribution, likely maintained by homeostatic proliferation).
We will fill this knowledge gap by generating a near-full length HIV provirus sequencing dataset deep enough to
accurately assess clonality richness and by developing models to more precisely quantify the fractional
contribution of antigen-driven versus homeostatic proliferation to reservoir maintenance. In Aim 1, we will fully
characterize the intact and defective provirus clonality distributions in PLWH on ART by generating near-full
length HIV provirus sequencing datasets deep enough to approximate clonality richness saturation. We will test
the hypothesis that provirus clonality distributions mirror those of uninfected memory CD4+ T cells, with a small
number of dominant clones and a large number of non-dominant clones, and that they can be modeled with
similar power-law exponents. In Aim 2, we will first generate longitudinal characterizations of in vivo antigen-
driven and homeostatic CD4+ T cell proliferation of uninfected CD4s in PLWH on ART using T cell receptor
repertoires. Then we will use this information to construct mathematical models to estimate the fractional
contributions of antigen-driven and homeostatic proliferation to the persistence of the reservoir in PLWH on ART.
We will test the hypothesis that both antigen-driven and homeostatic proliferation contributes significantly to the
maintenance of the HIV LR. This work and the resulting models will help the HIV cure field design future
therapeutic strategies and help the field predict more precisely outcomes when HIV cure strategies such as anti-
proliferative therapies or personalized therapeutic vaccines are trialed."
11030568,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As our population ages, the incidence of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), Amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) and other related neurodegenerative diseases continues to rise, and the need for successful
translational research programs is imperative to maintain a healthy aging population and reduce the burden of
increased health care costs on society. While much understanding of neurodegenerative mechanisms have
been gained over the years of investigation, not much had been successfully translated into patient treatment
which calls for deeper appreciation of these diseases through clinical perspective in the future
neurodegeneration investigators. The Neurodegeneration Training Program (NTP) has been designed for
selected students to provide rigorous pre-doctoral scientific training in the field of neurodegeneration along with
extensive clinical exposure. The goal of the NTP is to provide trainees with the fundamental skills necessary
for outstanding careers in neurodegeneration research, together with an appreciation of the challenges and
complexity of diagnosing and treating neurodegenerative diseases in the clinical setting. The NTP emphasizes
rigorous PHD training in fundamental aspects of neurodegeneration and mechanisms of diseases involving
neurodegeneration and clinical perspectives through classroom teaching, neurodegeneration-related
laboratory research and mentored neurodegenerative clinical experiences combined with educational forums
that address important topics in clinical and translational neurodegeneration research.
A competitive pool of trainees will combine with 19 outstanding faculty in state-of –the-art facilities to
investigate a wide range of neurodegeneration-related topics spanning research areas such as molecular
genetics, protein structure, cell and molecular biology and in vitro and in vivo models of disease. The NTP
promotes collaboration between departments and schools at Case Western Reserve University, particularly the
School of Medicine, and with its affiliated institutions in the Cleveland area: University Hospitals Cleveland
Medical Center (UHCMC), and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF, including the Lerner Research Institute).
All of these institutions are within walking distance of each other and this rich training environment enjoys very
active basic science and clinical activities. The updated curriculum provides a solid foundation for
neurodegeneration research. The well-received mentored neurodegenerative clinical experience has been
expanded to include six renowned clinicians enabling direct interaction with patients and caregivers in several
different clinical centers close to CWRU campus providing motivation to the trainees to produce advances in
disease diagnosis and therapies. The recently added career development and professional enrichment module
ensures better preparedness of our trainees to achieve their desired career goals. Together, NTP training will
provide trainees a solid foundation for an outstanding neurodegeneration-related career."
11030573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eukaryotic cells sequester critical biochemical reactions into discrete membranous compartments, whereby
membrane dynamics driven by protein catalysts facilitate differentiation, communication, and spatial organization
of intracellular compartments. Within a cell, mitochondria are mainly organized into highly interconnected
networks, whose diverse functions are dependent on their complex structure and organization. In humans, OPA1
and MICOS are essential biomolecular machines that control not only the morphology of the mitochondrial
reticulum, but also the efficiency of many key mitochondrial processes, including oxidative phosphorylation,
metabolism, apoptosis, and mtDNA maintenance. The GTPase OPA1 is crucial for mitochondrial IM fusion and
regulating cristae dynamics, whereas the multi-component MICOS complex plays a dual role by shaping IM
cristae junctions and forming contact sites with the outer membrane. Characterizing how mitochondrial dynamics
are realized and regulated will be essential to deciphering the link between mitochondrial morphology and
function. Moreover, molecular abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics result in aberrant mitochondrial structure,
impaired bioenergetics, severely reduced respiratory capacity, mtDNA instability, increased sensitivity to
apoptosis, and development of a wide variety of disease conditions, including neurodegenerative disorders,
diverse cancers, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that alter mitochondrial
morphology and function remain incompletely understood. Here, using a combination of cellular and structural
analyses, we aim to develop a molecular understanding of mitochondrial dynamics that govern key physiological
processes in cells. We propose to determine the molecular mechanism of mitochondrial morphogenesis by
exploring the assembly mechanism of OPA1 and its interactions with the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin (Aim 1).
We further propose to characterize the molecular details of multi-component MICOS complex and protein
dynamics that facilitate cristae formation and maintain the characteristic architecture of mitochondria (Aim 2).
Structural and functional studies of mitochondrial protein machines will provide a platform to identify the basis of
pathologies linked to human disease and age-related illness. Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms
of mitochondrial dynamics will increase the probability of success in developing new therapeutic interventions."
11017281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The craniofacial skeleton is composed of multiple tissue types that must be precisely integrated during
development to ensure normal structure and function. While the mechanisms orchestrating this process are
key to revealing the etiology of congenital disorders with craniofacial differences, our current understanding of
the craniofacial skeleton is largely based on studies that focus on bone and cartilage. Conversely, the
mechanisms that regulate differentiation and patterning of diverse soft connective tissues, inter-tissue
crosstalk, and the formation of the connections between different tissue types in the head remain largely
unknown. The scope of the proposed study is comprehensive and forward-thinking, as it investigates the
craniofacial skeleton as a multi-tissue system, addressing critical gaps in our understanding of craniofacial
connective tissue development and maintenance in four complementary research programs. These programs
leverage Dr. Amy Merrill’s expertise craniofacial development to decode the molecular identities of connective
tissue cells, reveal their role in joint development and maintenance, identify the signals that bridge connective
tissue and bone, and establish novel associations between connective tissue development and human
disease. Utilizing both disease-first and gene-first approaches from this distinct perspective, alongside an
expert team of human geneticists, this research aims to identify new genes variants that cause human
craniofacial disorders. Cutting-edge techniques in spatial transcriptomics and mouse genetics will be used to
identify genes and pathways regulating assembly of the craniofacial skeleton, engineer new tools that target
and track understudied skeletal tissue types, and establish powerful models of human congenital disorders.
The increased flexibility and duration of the R35 grant will facilitate these technological advances, breaking
new ground to uncover fundamental programs that regulate skeletal connectivity in craniofacial development
and disease. Dr. Merrill is uniquely poised to successfully lead this study at the University of Southern
California in the Center for Craniofacial Molecular Biology, a rapidly growing research center with exceptional
resources directed by Dr. Yang Chai. She has an outstanding record of research productivity and impact in the
field of craniofacial biology and currently holds two R01’s from NIDCR. Dr. Merrill has shown excellence in
mentoring, which is reflected by the success of her trainees, recognition with the prestigious USC Mentoring
Award in 2022, and role as Co-Investigator on USC’s NIDCR T90 Training Grant for Craniofacial Biology. She

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) has become the standard of care for treatment of
several life-threatening hematologic malignancies, immunodeficiency and genetic diseases. Unfortunately, as
the survival rate of these patients is improved, the quality of life is negatively impacted by Graft vs Host Disease
(GVHD). GVHD is a complex, multi-organ disorder arising from immunological attack by donor allo-reactive T
cells that results in damage to the GI tract, liver, skin and the eye. Ocular GVHD (oGVHD) occurs in >60% of
patients with GVHD and can threaten vision due to lacrimal gland and conjunctival damage leading to dry eye,
keratopathy and corneal perforation. Despite the high frequency of eye involvement in GVHD patients, little is
known regarding the underlying immune mechanisms responsible for oGVHD that lead to keratoconjunctivitis
sicca. Unfortunately, the ophthalmic care of these patients is restricted to palliative therapies and anti-
inflammatory drugs with limited mechanisms of action and efficacy. Our recent exciting findings using nanostring
analysis, support the notion that selected genes including cytokines, antigen presenting / MHC, T cell, and TNF
superfamily (TNFRSF) pathways are differentially regulated and involved in oGVHD affecting the conjunctiva
and lacrimal gland (Conj+LaGL). In this application, we continue to use pre-clinical models to understand why
the eye is a target tissue in GVHD and propose to develop new translational targeted immunotherapies to locally
prevent and treat oGVHD. Experiments here will investigate CD4 and CD8 Teff mediated damage to Conj+LaGL
(Aim 1). We will utilize our TCR transgenic (Tg) and newly developed double reporter (B6-nur77GFPFoxP3RFP)
mice to understand local activation of CD4 and CD8 Teff & Tregs. Using scRNAseq and mass cytometry imaging,
studies will provide insights into local T cells receiving alloantigen stimulation. Next, we will interrogate for the
first time, hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic antigen presenting cell (APC) pathways in oGVHD (Aim 2). We
will apply in vivo models combining TCR Tg donors with hematopoietic chimeras to enable precise interrogation
of direct and indirect antigen presentation pathways in the Conj+LaGL damage. These studies will drive
development of new strategies using biological reagents and epigenetic regulation for prevention and treatment
of aHSCT that can be translated to patients (Aim 3). Notably, our 2-receptor pathway strategy using a novel
fusion protein (TL1A-Ig) targeting TNFRSF25 and IL-2, which targets CD25 locally expands ocular Tregs.
Because bromodomain proteins have a central role in regulating transcription of inflammatory genes, we propose
to use inhibitors of these proteins (BETi), applied as a local ocular formulation to suppress cytokines by infiltrating
and parenchymal Conj+LaGL cell populations. Furthermore, we will generate a new oGVHD treatment approach
by combining our local 2-pathway Treg expansion strategy with this epigenetic regulation. Our overall objective
is to test the hypothesis that immune mediated damage to the Conj+LaGL underlie development of sicca which
can be prevented by targeted immune therapy."

This application for the Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (PA-23-189)
proposes a research and career development plan to develop the independence of Dr. Brittney Francis
through a study titled, “An exploration of segregation, neighborhood-level contextual factors and maternal
hypertension among Black women in the U.S. using causal inference methods” for the award period of
07/01/24-06/30/26 to enhance the parent grant, “An assessment of environmental and neighborhood-level risk
factors for subfertility among Black women in the U.S.” (R01-ES035053; PI- Dr. Amelia Wesselink). The
proposed supplement study will conduct a secondary analysis using causal mediation methods with the
overarching goal of examining the complex association between racial residential segregation, neighborhood
level contextual factors, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) in the Black Women’s Health Study
(BWHS). HDP is an important public health problem for many reasons. A person impacted by an HDP is more
likely to experience other maternal complications and adverse sequalae associated with them which has
immediate and long-term health impacts across an individual’s lifecourse and their offspring. This study will use
existing (through parent grant) and new data linkages to the BWHS to specifically examine food access and
exposure to environmental toxins as mediators between the relationship of racial and economic segregation
and HDPs among Black women. This proposed diversity supplement will significantly contribute to furthering
our understanding of the role of structural racism in shaping risk of maternal HDP and points of intervention
that can decrease the health inequities we see for Black women on a population level. This proposed research
is critical, timely and can be translated to impact current policy decisions about neighborhood infrastructure
and development that will advance reproductive health equity, promote reproductive justice, create safe and
healthy neighborhoods, and reduce the costs due to health disparities in this country."

This proposal seeks to address gaps in Intersex and Variations of Sex Development (I/VSC) health by
investing directly in Intersex-led, grassroots research efforts. The proposed study represents a strong
collaboration between members of the Intersex Research Coalition (IRC) and researchers who lead the EDIT
and ADVOCATE Programs within Northwestern University‘s Institute for Sexual and Gender Minority Health
and Wellbeing (ISGMH). The IRC is a coalition of community partners, medical students, Intersex activists,
physicians, and public health professionals who are interested in learning more about what it means to deliver
affirming care to I/VSC people. The EDIT and ADVOCATE Programs both are dedicated to advancing
community-led research that promotes intersectional sexual and gender minority (SGM) health equity. We
recognize that community participatory action research is a pathway to change in policies and practices that
center intersectional equity for I/VSC people. In brief, we will recruit 200 I/VSC individuals diverse in race,
ethnicity, and gender to complete a survey to elicit feedback on I/VSC health research priorities, experiences of
erasure and affirmation within sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity (SSOGI) measurement in I/VSC
populations, and alcohol use. Qualitatively, we will conduct in-depth interviews with up to 20 I/VSC participants
to identify what existing measurement tools have been used in I/VSC populations, shortcomings of these
measurement tools, what SSOGI information I/VSC people are willing to share in different settings, the nuance
of intersex vs. VSC specific language, and future directions for improved I/VSC population measurement. The
supplement will apply minority stress, intersectionality, and life course theoretical frames and use participatory
action research methods to ensure that future I/VSC research is more effectively positioned to be affirming,
contextually valid, meaningful, and positively impactful to multiply minoritized I/VSC populations. This proposal
leverages the strong foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration, community insight, and effective
dissemination established within Project Recognize, as well as our team’s clear and unique insights into the
current gaps and opportunities in SSOGI measurement that are also responsive to the NASEM report’s call to
measure I/VSC populations. Overall, our interdisciplinary team of investigators, mixed-methods strategies, and
the foundation of community engagement and trust on which the parent grant is built support feasibility of the
completion of all study aims and objectives. This project will result in the development of measures that are
affirming, reliable, and valid in diverse I/VSC populations across multiple contexts. Future adoption of these
measures in public health research will yield the first affirming population assessments of I/VSC health and
inform a community-led, evidence-informed research agenda to pave the way forward for I/VSC health equity."

11008778,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive and fatal fibrotic lung disorder which
disproportionately affects men and the elderly. Although two drugs (pirfenidone and nintedanib) have recently
gained FDA-approval for IPF and progressive fibrosing lung disorders related to connective tissue diseases
(rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma, more common in younger women), these drugs are by no means curative.
In fact, these therapies show only a modest reduction in the rate of lung function decline and do not improve
quality of life. Unfortunately, several potential therapies in the fibrosis pipeline have failed to meet their endpoints
in recent trials. Hence, we are left with suboptimal treatments and lung transplantation as the only current
treatment for IPF patients. Importantly, no available therapies ‘reverse’ fibrosis. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) is
a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and scaffolding protein that regulates the pro-fibrotic phenotype of lung
fibroblasts, including secretion of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin and collagen), myofibroblast
differentiation, cell migration, and resistance to apoptosis. In recent analyses of gene expression in lung tissue
from IPF patients, FAK is highly upregulated in both early IPF and advanced IPF compared to health controls.
Moreover, the scaffolding function of the Focal Adhesion Targeting (FAT) domain of FAK has been
demonstrated to be critical for the development of lung fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. However, the FAK
inhibitors developed to date only target its kinase enzyme and ignore FAK’s role as a scaffolding protein.
Because current FAK-kinase inhibitors do not inhibit key FAT domain interactions in lung fibroblasts and show
high off-target toxicity, the development of novel FAK inhibitors that target the non-catalytic scaffolding function
or FAT domain of FAK remains a significant unmet clinical need. FAKnostics, LLC has identified a first-in-class
series of stapled peptide-based FAK inhibitors that directly target the FAT domain of FAK. In Phase I, we
developed lead peptide FN-2012 with potent anti-fibrotic effects in IPF cells and lung fibroblasts (IMR90),
including reduction in protein levels of collagen, α-SMA, and fibronectin. We also demonstrated significant in
vivo efficacy in a mouse model of lung fibrosis. Through this Phase II STTR project, FAKnostics seeks to
continue the development of FAK FAT inhibitors as therapy for lung fibrosis. In Aim 1, we will develop
chemistry manufacturing & controls for the production of lead peptide FN-2012. In Aim 2, we will perform IND-
enabling toxicology studies. In Aim 3, we will comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of FN-2012 in vivo using
the aged bleomycin model and human IPF precision cut lung slices. Upon successful completion of these aims,
FAKnostics intends to initiate GMP manufacturing and safety pharmacology studies in preparation for an FDA
IND application and first-in-human clinical trial."

Black Americans experience disproportionality high rates of obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes and may
derive fewer metabolic benefits from weight loss compared to their White counterparts. The mechanisms
responsible for these differences are poorly understood as Black men and women are typically underrecruited
in clinical studies. Intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) is marbled within and next to skeletal muscle and can
cause muscle insulin resistance by bathing the muscles in inflammatory cytokines, adipokines, eicosanoids,
and free fatty acids (the IMAT secretome). The literature shows that Black individuals have greater IMAT
content and adipose tissue inflammation compared to White individuals. Preliminary data show that IMAT has
a similar or worse secretome as visceral adipose tissue towards muscle insulin sensitivity, with secretion of
inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids contributing to muscle insulin resistance. Our central hypothesis is
that IMAT secretion of inflammatory cytokines is greater in Black than White participants with less improvement
following weight loss, contributing to the racial differences in insulin sensitivity. The purposed research
addresses the critical need to elucidate disease mechanisms in Black individuals by comparing changes in the
IMAT secretome before and after weight loss between Black and White participants. The rationale is that we
will generate new information for differences by race in IMAT paracrine signaling and generate new information
for changes in the IMAT secretome by race after weight loss. By identifying differences between obese Black
and White participants in the IMAT secretome before and after weight loss, this critical research can support
development of tailored diabetes interventions and treatments.
We propose two specific aims: Aim1: Evaluate the potency of IMAT paracrine signaling to decrease insulin
sensitivity in Black and White participants. We hypothesize IMAT secretes greater inflammatory cytokines and
eicosanoids linked to decreased insulin sensitivity in Black compared to White participants. In vitro experiments
will measure the potency of the IMAT secretome to cause insulin resistance by race. Aim 2: Determine the
effect of weight loss on the IMAT content and paracrine signaling in Black versus White participants. We again
hypothesize that weight loss will diminish IMAT secretion of inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids linked to
decreased insulin sensitivity, but this decrease will be less in Black compared to White individuals. Participants
with obesity will be studied before and after a 12-week weight loss intervention. IMAT will be sampled using an
ultrasound-guided IMAT biopsy technique, insulin sensitivity measured using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic
clamps, and IMAT content measured using MRI. IMAT will be cultured to generate conditioned media, followed
by conditioned media analyses and testing of its direct metabolic effects in vitro. This project will reveal racial
differences in IMAT secretome, and malleability after weight loss that will inform tailored development of
interventions to prevent IMAT-induced insulin resistance.

This Fast Track proposal's overarching goal is to develop a comprehensive platform for the
identification and validation of recombinant antibodies (Abs) that are specific to protein isoform
splice-junction sites. This initiative addresses key challenges in the protein-level characterization of
splice variants, which is a critical area in understanding and treating diseases related to alternative
splicing of proteins. The project introduces an innovative ""Epivolve"" phage display technology,
utilizing a “pseudo-haptenylated” amino acid to generate site-directed Abs against these splice
variants. The initial phase of the project, Phase I, will focus on validating the several existing splice-
site specific Abs through methods such as western blotting and flow cytometry, with a vision to
expand applications in future offerings. And the use of Epivolve to generate Abs de novo from phage
display libraries to the same sites as a proof of concept. This strategy is significant as alternative
splicing is known to contribute to the malignant progression of cancer, highlighting the potential
impact of this research in oncology. Phase II of the proposal takes the project further by producing
display libraries in a novel vector system that combines phage- and yeast display technologies. A
key aspect of this phase is the targeted effort to identify potential neoantigens near the amino
terminus of G-protein-coupled receptors, a potentially promising area in cancer research.
Additionally, the proposal outlines a commercialization strategy, reflecting the project's progression
towards practical applications. The final step in this strategy involves scaling up the production of
these site-directed Abs and continuing their validation. This phase is crucial to ensure the
effectiveness and reliability of the Abs for broader use, potentially revolutionizing the approach to
diagnosing and treating diseases related to protein splicing."

 Our research goal is to develop new catalytic technologies for the rapid synthesis and late-stage
functionalization under mild reaction conditions of complex, biorelevant molecules. Our research efforts have
been directed to exploit visible-light-induced excited-state catalysis, a process that involves at least one
photoexcited catalytic species, to address unmet challenges in organic synthesis. Excited-state catalysis
involves the photoexcitation of catalytic organic or organometallic compounds that allows access to their excited-
state landscapes for the development of previously elusive synthetic transformations. This proposal aims to
continue our efforts in establishing novel excited-state catalytic platforms for the synthesis of valuable fluorinated
compounds, the derivatization of carbonyl moieties, and the site-selective functionalization of carbohydrates.
More specifically, we will develop (i) polyfluoroalkoxylation reactions of various hydrocarbons via excited-state
catalysis; (ii) new redox-active reagents such as those that can be used for pentafluorosulfenylation and
fluorosulfonylation; (iii) regioselective polyfluoroalkoxylation reactions of arenes and heteroarenes through
metallaphotocatalysis; (iv) new excited-state catalysts to modulate the reactivity of carbonyl compounds; and (v)
site-selective functionalization of carbohydrates. Since fluorinated compounds, carbonyl derivatives, and
functionalized sugars are ubiquitous in natural products, therapeutics, imaging agents, fine chemicals, and
biomaterials, successful development of the proposed research will allow convenient access to and the studies
of numerous new functional molecules to aid the discovery and development of new drugs, agrochemicals, bio-
probes, and polymers."

 Eating disorders (ED) are serious psychiatric illnesses associated with various medical and functional
complications. It is unknown which specific cognitive-affective mechanisms driving EDs impact the
development of medical and functional complications, and whether targeting these mechanisms through
personalized treatment leads to better outcomes than existing “one-size-fits-all” interventions. Furthermore, it is
unclear how social determinants of health (SDOH) impact the heterogeneity of EDs and how they should best
be integrated into treatment. The long-term research goal of the diversity supplement candidate, Mr. Juan
Hernandez, is to created new innovative, efficacious, and cost-effective personalized ED treatments for diverse
communities. Consistent with this goal, the current Diversity Supplement proposes to use idiographic network
modeling to examine individual differences in ED symptom presentations and test whether a personalized
intervention approach outperforms existing front-line treatments (i.e., CBT-E). The current proposal builds on
the parent grant (DP2MH136495) and will uniquely contribute to the literature by examining how individual
differences in EDs are associated with medical and functional complications and SDOH, each of which directly
impact longevity and quality of life. Grounded in existing literature, we hypothesize that central cognitive-
affective mechanisms will vary across individuals and will be more associated with medical disorders and
functional outcomes (i.e., health-related quality of life, physical functionality and vitality, health perceptions,
achievement of self-defined goals) than behavioral symptoms. We also hypothesize that more disadvantaged
SDOH (e.g., more severe food insecurity, more experiences of marginalization) will also be associated with
more medical disorders and worse functional outcomes. As per treatment effects, we hypothesize that at post-
treatment, the personalized treatment condition will be associated with less medical disorders and better
functional outcomes compared to the front-line treatment condition. Lastly, we hypothesize that at post-
treatment, the personalized treatment condition will not be as impacted by SDOH as front-line treatments
across medical and functional outcomes. This study will be the first to examine (a) individual differences in EDs
impact on medical and functional complications and (b) how to best incorporate SDOH into ED treatment to
address medical and functional complications. Results will inform important etiological and treatment questions
that will directly inform efforts to promote longevity and quality of life among those experiencing an ED. The
conceptual, quantitative, and professional rigor of the training plan will prepare Mr. Hernandez to meet his
long-term goal of conducting clinical ED research at a Research 1 University. With the post-doctoral training
from this supplement, Mr. Hernandez will increase diversity of the field and fill a crucial role as an independent
clinical science researcher and translational health psychologist."

1) Combine the knowledge bases of science and medicine to establish a strong foundation; 2) Integrate
critical thinking, reasoning and rigor in the conduct of research; 3) Demonstrate integrity in research and
clinical practice; 4) Demonstrate skills in oral and written communication; 5) Recognize the importance of
diversity, equity and inclusion; work effectively in a diverse professional environment, demonstrating
respect for individual differences; 6) Demonstrate leadership in research and clinical care; and 7)
Understand the diversity of career options for physician scientists. The U of Iowa MSTP is led by Co-PIs
Steven Lentz, MD, PhD (Director) and Pamela Geyer, PhD (Co-Director) who share a long-standing
passion for mentoring and training physician-scientists. The Program incorporates specific coursework
and activities throughout the course of study to provide integration and enrichment of the curriculum and
foster program identity, professionalism, teamwork, communication, career development skills, and
mentorship of students during transitions. The Program has 87 talented and diverse faculty members
who provide exciting research training opportunities. Students are extensively involved in MSTP
leadership, serving as members on the Executive, Admissions, MSTP Mondays, Seminar, Retreat,
Wellness, and Women's Group committees. The Program enjoys strong institutional support from the
Deans of the Carver College of Medicine and the Graduate College, who promote the MSTP as a driver
for innovation in research, education and service at the university. The U of Iowa MSTP currently has 73
trainees, of which 43% are women and 18% are from groups underrepresented in medicine. The majority
of our graduates have gone on to careers at major academic medical centers or research institutions.
This application requests support for 18 trainees per year, reflecting the strength and outcomes of our
training program."

Mutation is the source of all evolutionary novelty and diversity shaping both the structure and sequence of
genomes. Over evolutionary timescales changes to genome structure and content are associated with vast
phenotypic changes between and within species. Throughout the lifetime of an organism individual cells
accumulate somatic mutations that can also confer selective advantages. Our lab is interested in how
mutations emerge and how these changes to genome sequence and structure are maintained and acted on by
selection. We seek to understand at both the cellular and organismal level how cell-type, genotype, selective
pressures, and evolutionary histories influence the structure and sequence of the genome. Ultimately, our
research will further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying why specific cell types are more
susceptible to disease as well as how genome structure influences phenotypic diversity within and between
species. Patterns of somatic mutation have been extensively studied in the context of cancer tumor genomes
in which clonal expansions amplify the signals of mutation to detectable levels. Far less is understood however
about how “normal” cells accumulate mutations through time and how these dynamics are influenced by
factors such as cell type and genotype. Furthermore, somatic mutations have proven challenging to identify
due to the comparably high error rate of standard sequencing approaches. We propose to use novel genomic
methods to investigate how different forms of somatic mutation accumulate and how somatic mutational
processes are impacted by inherited genetic variation. In addition to discerning the contexts in which individual
cells accumulate mutations, we propose to determine how genome structures have evolved in the context of
different evolutionary histories, selective pressures, and life history strategies. While the size and structure of
eukaryotic genomes varies tremendously spanning three orders of magnitude in vertebrates, the evolutionary
and mechanistic bases of this variation remain unknown. We propose to study the evolution of genome
architectures in the explosive adaptive radiation of rockfish to understand how extreme variation in lifespan can
impact mutational processes and genetic diversity. We further propose to study how the structures of human
and chimpanzee genomes have been shaped by local adaptations and the forces of selection. Identifying
signatures of selection and adaption at structurally variable (SV) loci has been challenging in part due the
tendency of SVs to emerge in complex repetitive regions of the genome. We propose to use long-read based
genomics approaches and novel computational methods to assess these loci. Ultimately, our research will
further our understanding of mutation, diversity, and genome structural diversity both within and between
species as well as among the individual cells of organisms."

The proposed project is focused on the crosstalk between metabolism and cell fate during development of the
paraxial mesoderm, the tissue which forms skeletal muscles and vertebrae. One striking characteristic of this
tissue is its segmentation into repeated structures termed somites, a process driven by a molecular oscillator
called segmentation clock [1]. Defects in paraxial mesoderm development can lead to severe malformations
such as congenital scoliosis, spina bifida or caudal agenesis. The paraxial mesoderm arises from a population
of progenitors located in the primitive streak and tail bud. Remarkably, these progenitor cells exhibit aerobic
glycolysis and an inverted intra- vs. extracellular pH gradient, which are characteristic of the Warburg effect of
cancer cells [2, 3]. In the tailbud, we demonstrated that glycolysis increases the intracellular pH to promote
acetylation of β-catenin and Wnt activation, which ultimately leads to paraxial mesoderm induction [3]. As these
processes are difficult to study in vivo, we have developed in vitro systems in which embryonic stem (ES) cells
or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be efficiently differentiated toward the paraxial mesoderm fate
recapitulating the normal features of its metabolism, signaling and even oscillations of the segmentation clock
[4-7]. We will now take advantage of these in vitro systems, as well as mouse and chicken embryos, to
characterize in detail the role of aerobic glycolysis in paraxial mesoderm development to see how it relates to
the Warburg effect. In this application, we propose to carry out large scale multi-omics experiments
(metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics) and live imaging of cellular metabolic state to
characterize the impact of metabolic transitions on the regulation of gene expression, protein function and cell
fate. As the physiological significance of the Warburg effect is not well understood, carefully dissecting its role
in the embryo might help shed light on its role in cancer. Finally, we propose to use in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro
systems recapitulating the oscillations of the segmentation clock to study the role of metabolism in the control
of the oscillatory period. We will analyze the differences in metabolism regulation between mouse and human
paraxial mesoderm cells, with special focus on mitochondrial respiration. The period of the oscillations diverges
significantly between the two species and can be used as a proxy for developmental timing to try to understand
why human development proceeds more slowly than mouse development. We expect these experiments to
shed light on the molecular basis of developmental timing, which is tightly linked to longevity in mammals."

Synapses are important structures connecting neurons and enabling fast signal transmission, providing the
building block of brain function. Advancements in sophisticated microscopy and electrophysiology technologies
have revealed significant heterogeneity among synapses, with the caveat that most of these studies have been
done in rodent model systems, while little is known about human synapse heterogeneity and molecular
composition. Synaptic dysfunction, often referred to as synaptopathy, encompasses numerous cellular,
molecular and structural changes, which ultimately lead to progressive loss of synapses, a disease-associate
phenotype originally proposed for Alzheimer’s disease, but since then also proposed as an early sign of disease
manifestation in other neurodegenerative diseases, including FTD and ALS. The latter has been demonstrated
in mouse models of familial FTD, but also in postmortem tissue of ALS/FTD patients, including those carrying
the C9orf72 mutation. More recent studies suggest that synapse loss might be preceded by changes in the
protein and RNA content of the synaptic structure itself, both pre-and postsynaptic. Meanwhile, C9orf72 protein
has been shown to be localized to the postsynaptic and presynaptic compartment, supporting C9orf72’s function
in vesicle trafficking and its activity as a Rab GTPase guanine exchange factor (GEF). Limited studies suggest
that the C9orf7 mutation induces disease-associated changes of the synaptome, but a comprehensive and
unbiased profiling of protein and RNA signatures at the diseased human cortical neuronal synapse is still missing.
At the same time, an aberrant synapse proteome and/or transcriptome have yet to be correlated with aberrant
microglia function, including synaptic pruning, and it is still poorly understood whether these pathological events
are initiated by microglia or by synaptic changes. The graduate student assigned to this project, Ashton Spillman,
will perform a comprehensive assessment on if and how signals from cortical neuronal synapses to microglia
lead to pathological synapse elimination in C9orf72-FTD using postmortem patient autopsy tissue and iPSC
neuron and microglia culture models in association with multi-omics and functional analyses. We hypothesize
that the C9orf72 repeat expansion-induced aberrant synaptome contributes to the activation of microglia and
aberrant microglia-associated synaptic pruning in C9orf72 FTD. These studies are critically important for our
understanding of what role synapse elimination plays and how it could lead to novel therapeutic target
identification, either directed at the synaptic proteome itself and/or the associated immune signaling."
11008137,"Whole blood [WB] transfusion is an effective therapy used to reduce the large number of
 preventable deaths from hemorrhagic trauma. The long-term objective of this project is to develop a
 modernized WB storage platform that reduces initial oxygen content and maintains an oxygen-managed
 environment during refrigerated storage in order to provide higher quality red blood cells (RBCs) for
 efficacious oxygen delivery and shock reversal, while maintaining bioequivalence in hemostatic and
 platelet (PLT) activity compared to conventionally prepared WB. To reduce waste and enable wide-
 spread adoption of WB, the proposed platform will include a novel WB additive solution, as well as a bag
 and an RBC additive solution to recover and store RBC for 6 weeks from expired WB, as the RBCs have
 a longer shelf life.
 Unlike the RBCs, PLTs contain mitochondria and rely on oxidative phosphorylation both in vivo and at
room temperature during storage for their viability. PLT metabolism at 1-6°C is significantly reduced, and the
cytochrome oxidase in mitochondria is known to have a very low Km. Unfortunately, the extensive preliminary
in vitro data which has been collected to date does not provide a clear answer regarding the effects of stable
low oxygen tension (~10-20mmHg) on PLT hemostatic function.
 The goal of this Phase 1 proposal is to obtain definitive data supporting the hypothesis that with its
reduced metabolic demands, the hypoxic RBC storage condition will provide adequate O2 tension to sustain
PLT’s hemostatic function, which would enable the project to proceed. The feasibility of this project will be
critically tested in this Phase 1 study by making hypoxic WB using an existing hypoxic RBC processing
system and tested in a small animal model study to compare the hemostatic function of conventionally
and hypoxically stored WB. Additionally, an in vitro study examining status of activation and activatability
of PLT under rejuvenated conditions mimicking the transfused state.
 If the milestone of Phase 1 is successfully reached, the development of both a novel hypoxic WB
storage platform with a newly formulated additive solution for the WB collected in CPD and a RBC storage
solution enabling a full 6-week shelf life for hypoxic RBC recovered from unused WB will begin. For both
solutions, a successful metabolomics based high-throughput additive screening method, developed under
separate SBIR Phase II grant for the screening novel hypoxic RBC additive solution, will be utilized."

the reactive glycolytic byproduct methylglyoxal (MG) is triggering the multitude of early-onset neurological
disorders by exerting varying actions of different cell types in the brain”. The aims are (1) define pathobiological
trajectory of early-onset neurological disorders in relation to MG, Glo-1, microvascular leakage, and inflammation
in HIV-1 infected Hu-mice with and with anti-retroviral treatment, and (2) show that lowering MG with novel, cell-
penetrant arginine-rich cyclic peptides will blunt neurological disorders in HIV-infected Hu-mice with and without

levels of the glycolysis byproduct MG, microvascular leakage, impaired synaptic transmission, and neurological
disorders, in our clinically relevant HIV-1 infected Hu-mice model. Preliminary structure-activity relationship

11021693,"Abstract
Individuals who have been previously incarcerated have a significantly higher risk of dying from overdose[4];
particularly in the first two weeks after release. More than 4.5 million people is the US are supervised in the
community setting and nearly half have a substance use disorder but few receive services. There is a critical
need for linkage to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) for individuals on community supervision.
Providing medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) to individuals on probation or parole decreases the rate
of relapse and recidivism, and increases retention in substance abuse treatment. In 2016, RIDOC introduced
the first correctional system-wide MOUD program in the country to initiate a comprehensive program to offer all
three FDA approved medications (in all prison or jail settings) to all eligible individuals. As a result of the
RIDOC program, we have expanded MOUD linkage to treatment in the community that is associated
with a significant drop in statewide overdose deaths post-release. This work is the foundation from which
we have built the current proposal. Our proposed research is to rigorously test a systems-change approach for
increasing use of MOUD using a randomized type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness design in probation
and parole sites. We propose a unique network of 7 geographically distinct community supervision (probation
and parole) performance sites from Rhode Island, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. After a 6-month period of
baseline for comparison, the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainability framework is used to
guide system-change through facilitated local change teams consisting of justice and community service
providers. A core set of implementation strategies is provided to all sites. The overall objective is to improve
linkage to the continuum of evidence-based care for justice-involved individuals. Organizational assessments
are timed with EPIS stages. At the end of Implementation, N=680 probation/parolee clients will be randomly
assigned to receive peer support specialists vs. no peer support with follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months.
Implementation outcomes include program acceptability, adoption, penetration, sustainability and costs. Client-
level effectiveness outcomes include retention, satisfaction, opioid use, opioid overdoses, recidivism, linkage to
OUD treatment, and utilization of recovery services. This research team is uniquely poised to evaluate the
implementation and impact of MOUD among justice-involved individuals, to answer questions of
urgent public health significance, inform implementation science, and improve service delivery."
11021238,"Project Summary - Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea and the most common cause
of healthcare-associated infection (HAIs) in the US, resulting in >450,000 infections and 29,000 deaths annually.
In fact, C. difficile was recently labeled as one of five “urgent threat” organisms by the CDC. Despite its
prevalence, C. difficile acquisition and transmission remain poorly understood. Recent changes in testing
strategies led to the surprising discovery that patients with C. difficile are more often colonized than infected.
Hospitals routinely place patients infected with C. difficile on “contact precautions” to prevent transmission.
However, this shifting epidemiology has led to an infection prevention dilemma: should patients with C. difficile
colonization be placed on contact precautions? The answer to this question is unknown. Recently published
infection prevention guidelines labeled this issue as “unresolved”. As a result, non-standardized practices are
being used. In our cohort of hospitals, 50% of hospitals place these patients on contact precautions and 50% do
not, suggesting that a substantial number of admitted patients are at potential risk of harm through either a)
unnecessary use of contact precautions OR b) through preventable exposure to C. difficile. The overall objective
of this proposal is to determine if contact precautions should be used in patients with C. difficile colonization.
First, we will determine the frequency, location, and amount of environmental C. difficile contamination among
300 patients with C. difficile colonization (150 with diarrhea and 150 without diarrhea) compared to 150 patients
with C. difficile infection (Specific Aim 1). Using these same rooms, we will then determine the frequency,
location, and amount of C. difficile contamination of 900 healthcare providers' (HCP) hands, HCP clothes, and
450 pieces of mobile, shared equipment following routine inpatient care of patients with C. difficile colonization
(Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will use ~1,500 C. difficile isolates from our unique C. difficile biorepository and
study activities in SA 1 and 2 to evaluate potential sources for C. difficile in-hospital transmission using molecular
epidemiology and whole genome sequencing (Specific Aim 3). This proposal will capitalize on the strengths of
the Duke Center for Antimicrobial Stewardship and Infection Prevention, including our collective expertise in
infection prevention and environmental contamination, our proven infrastructure for studies involving
environmental sampling, and our validated microbiological, statistical, and molecular epidemiological methods.
Our central hypothesis is that patients with C. difficile colonization contaminate their environment (surfaces, HCP,
and equipment) as frequently as patients with C. difficile infection and, as a result, are a source of in hospital
transmission. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the status
quo of infection prevention and will use innovative methods to evaluate a critical infection prevention dilemma.
This proposal will be significant because it will provide critical information about the role of colonization in C.
difficile transmission and whether contact precautions should be used for this patient group."
11020764,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease with more than 6.5
million Americans currently living with AD dementia. AD is defined by its neuropathological
hallmarks which include Aβ peptide plaque deposits, intraneuronal tau tangles and neuronal loss.
A major component of the AD process is neuroinflammation. Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have revealed several immune genes which are risk factors for developing late-onset
AD. Several of these AD risk genes such as SPI1 and TREM2 are highly expressed in microglia,
the brain’s resident macrophage-like population. Microglia phagocytose Aβ and play a central role
in the brain’s response to amyloid plaques and the neurodegenerative process. While pluripotent
stem cell-derived neural organoids do not typically contain immune cell populations, Stem
Pharm’s hydrogel-enabled neural organoids allow for incorporation of microglia in a reproducible,
96-well plate format amenable to screening applications. Using this technology, our preliminary
data demonstrate microglia incorporate into the neural organoids and respond appropriately to
inflammatory stimuli including Aβ oligomers and apoptotic neurons. Work in this proposal will lead
to the generation of a human AD-neuroinflammation organoid model by exposing cultures with
oligomeric Aβ and apoptotic neuronal cells to induce AD-like neuroinflammatory responses,
ultimately enabling a more biologically relevant human AD model for drug discovery applications
focused on immune modulation. Specific Aims will 1) optimize the model and establish the gene
expression signature of the microglia; 2) and incorporate microglia engineered with mutations in
the AD associated gene TREM2. Completion of these specific aims will establish a flexible
neuroinflammation model system capable of screening the effects of compounds or incorporating
microglia harboring mutant AD-associated genes. Phase II studies will seek to expand the
capabilities of the model by establishing and optimizing readouts to measure the effect of
inflammation on the neuronal cell populations and establish organoids from additional donors.
Ultimately, this work will develop commercially available, novel models of the AD inflammation
process which can serve to supplement the many rodent model systems currently available."
11014834,"Sex, Hormones and Identity affect Nociceptive Expression Observed in Non-binary adults (SHINE ON)
Project Summary
In the clinical population, women are more likely to report chronic pain and greater pain sensitivity than men
and this difference has traditionally been reported as a “sex” difference. Too commonly, many conflate “sex”
and “gender”, though these terms are not the same, nor are they always congruent. Our previous work showed
that transgender women (TW) and cis women (CW) reported similar pain sensitivity that was different from cis
men (CM), suggesting that gender identity was more important than sex assigned at birth. Whereas our current
project (1R01-NR019417-01) seeks to explore pain sensitivity and immune cell function in cis and trans men
and women (CM, CW, TM, TW), no pain-related study to date has included non-binary adults (NB). The current
proposal seeks to add 40 NB adults [20 assigned male at birth (AMAB); 20 assigned female at birth, (AFAB)] to
the ongoing parent project to investigate the impact of this gender identity category on pain sensitivity and
immune cell function. NB adults often face additional stigma and discrimination and are at risk for poor mental
health outcomes, making it imperative to include this group in the parent project. The proposed project builds
on the ongoing SHINE project (1R01-NR019417-01) in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI: NOT-
OD-22-032) and is directly in line with the 2022-2026 NINR Strategic Plan framework and priorities."
11013043,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen that has been associated with increased risk of developing cancers
of the lung, skin, and bladder. However, the mechanism of arsenic tumorgenicity remains incompletely
described. Arsenic has been shown to upregulate NRF2, the master regulator of the cellular stress response in
vitro and in vivo. Under non-stress conditions, the basal level of NRF2 is kept low by KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1-
mediated ubiquitylation and subsequent 26S proteasomal degradation. During canonical NRF2 activation
KEAP1-Cys151 is modified, preventing NRF2 ubiquitylation and increasing the level of NRF2 and its downstream
genes to protect cells from environmental insults. Once cellular homeostasis is restored, NRF2 returns to low
basal level, ensuring transient NRF2 upregulation. However, we discovered arsenic activates NRF2 by a non-
canonical mechanism. Environmentally relevant doses of arsenic block autophagosome maturation, which leads
to p62-mediated sequestration of KEAP1 into autophagosomes, blocking NRF2 ubiquitylation and degradation.
This leads to sustained hyperexpression of NRF2 and its antioxidant response element (ARE) containing target
genes, conferring a cellular survival advantage. Interestingly, our novel unpublished results demonstrate that the
ATPase associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) chaperone, p97, contains a functional ARE in its
promoter. Functionally, p97 uses the binding and hydrolysis of ATP to generate a force to segregate ubiquitylated
proteins from other biomolecules, often for subsequent degradation by the proteasome. We have demonstrated
that p97 negatively regulates NRF2 by extracting ubiquitinated NRF2 from the KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex that facilitates NRF2 degradation by proteasome. This segregase activity of p97 plays a
prominent role in protein homeostasis – proteostasis. Our finding of p97 as a novel NRF2 target gene indicates
that NRF2 controls not only oxidative stress but also proteotoxic stress. Like NRF2, hyperexpression of p97 in
human tumors has been reported and p97 is considered a target for treating cancer. We also observed that the
protein levels of both NRF2 and p97 were increased in arsenic transformed cell lines and in human lung tumor
tissues (preliminary data). Based on these findings, we propose the following model: Under basal conditions,
low level expression of NRF2 and p97 is maintained through the NRF2-p97-NRF2 negative feedback loop.
However, during chronic arsenic exposure, this NRF2-p97-NRF2 negative feed bask loop is disabled since NRF2
is no longer ubiquitylated, resulting in sustained upregulation of both NRF2 and p97. Thus, arsenic increases
both the oxidative stress response and the proteotoxic stress response. We will test our hypothesis that
sustained NRF2 and NRF2-mediated p97 upregulation in response to environmental arsenic exposure
provides a survival advantage that enables arsenic-exposed cells to survive both oxidative and
proteotoxic stress and to accumulate sufficient molecular events that drive malignant transformation."
11026339,"Significance – Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common causes of cancer deaths for women with
increasing incidence among women Veterans in the VA Health Care System. Patient survival has improved
dramatically for primary BC but metastatic BC, for which targeted agents are usually not available, is common
in African-American Veterans and is largely incurable. Most BC treatments target proliferating tumor cells that
rely on glycolysis to fuel their metabolic needs. However, metastatic BC may exhibit a cancer stem cell phenotype
with considerable dormancy and acquired drug resistance. These BC, including triple negative BC (TNBC), are
often dependent on mitochondrial respiration (oxidative phosphorylation; oxphos) to generate energy and
promote survival. Since there are no targeted therapies for TNBC and since most mitochondrial-targeting drugs
exhibit substantial toxicity, there is a need to find new and safer therapeutic agents. Using a direct drug discovery
approach and computer-assisted drug design (CADD), we identified novel small molecules that interfere with
protein:DNA binding and transcriptional activity. While normal epithelial cells were relatively resistant, a lead
compound (CADD522) inhibited BC cell proliferation and tumorsphere formation, delayed tumor growth and
metastasis in vivo, and inhibited mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and respiration (oxygen
consumption) while increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Premise – Understanding the molecular mechanisms of targeting mitochondrial ATP synthase to elevate ROS
in cancer cells will likely result in novel therapeutics against metastatic BC. Patients with drug-resistant, dormant
or metastatic disease could benefit from a therapeutic approach that targets mitochondrial oxphos by
inhibiting ATP synthase. Therefore, we propose the hypothesis that targeting mitochondrial metabolism with
a novel ATP synthase inhibitor will inhibit BC tumor progression and metastasis by lowering ATP levels, reducing
cellular respiration, and increasing ROS damage for therapeutic benefit.
Specific Aims – Specific Aim 1: Define the mechanistic basis for CADD522-mediated ATP synthase inhibition in
restraining BC tumor cell proliferation. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), global gene expression
profiles and direct targeting of ATP synthase will be defined. Specific Aim 2: Determine the mechanisms through
which CADD522-mediated OCR inhibition increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) to reduce glucose utilization.
Redox balance, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, and TCA cycle flux will be measured. Specific Aim 3:
Define the translational potential of mitochondrial targeting with CADD522 to promote ROS damage and inhibit
BC growth and metastasis. In vitro toxicological assays and in vivo tumor models will assess translational
potential after oral administration of a novel therapeutic agent.
Overall Impact – Elucidating how reprogrammed cancer cell metabolism promotes BC progression may lead to
strategies to prevent or treat metastatic BC. Using agents that target a tumor’s metabolic requirements is an
innovative approach and may inhibit metastatic pathways involving mitochondrial metabolism (stem-like and/or
slow-growing tumors). These mitochondria-targeted approaches will exploit differences between normal and
cancer cells, which may ultimately have an impact on clinical efficacy and safety. Discovery of new metabolic
biomarkers will aid in patient stratification and clinical evaluation thus providing strong justification for future
investigational new drug development. In summary, these approaches will be fundamental in elucidating the
translational potential of metabolic targeting, are of relevance to the VA health care mission, and will likely lead
to the discovery of new treatments for Veterans with metastatic BC."
11027298,"ABSTRACT
 Recent advances in high-resolution volumetric imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing have enabled the
characterization of neuronal diversity and the genetic programs that specify identity. Meanwhile, our
understanding of the diversity of synapses and their genetic underpinnings remains limited. Decoding the genetic
programs responsible for the formation and maintenance of neural architectures can help us understand the
functional role of synapses in the brain and offer entry points towards designing genetic targets for the treatment
of mental health disorders related to brain connectivity.
 Based on the evidence of conservation of neural architectures in a wide range of neural systems and strong
preliminary results in C. elegans, I hypothesize that synaptic connectivity is genetically encoded. Specifically, I
hypothesize that complimentary gene combinations specify pre-synaptic neurons and their post-synaptic neural
partners (resembling a ""key-and-lock"" combination). Single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell resolution
connectivity datasets make this hypothesis testable. I will test this hypothesis in two parallel aims using the
computational Network Differential Gene Expression (nDGE) tool I have pioneered. This technique integrates
single-cell resolution gene expression data with single-cell resolution connectivity to assign statistical
significance to combinatorial genetic patterns enriched in synaptically connected neurons. Across two aims, I
will investigate the transcriptional encoding of the structural and functional connectome of C. elegans (Aim 1)
and the micro-connectivity of pyramidal cells and interneurons in the CA1 region of the rodent hippocampus (Aim
2). To accomplish these aims, I will build additional computational tools to extract a functional connectome in C.
elegans (Aim 1b) and harmonize spatial transcriptomic data with functional calcium imaging data in the rodent
hippocampus (Aim 2a). Together, these aims will provide two substantial entry points towards elucidating the
genetic programming of neural architectures across multiple animal nervous systems. Additionally, these aims
will generate valuable computational tools for the benefit of the molecular and systems neuroscience community
as a whole. The multiple animal approach will ensure the robustness and biological validity of the computational
models and tools that I will introduce to the neuroscience community.
 During the K99 phase of this award, occurring within Columbia's vibrant neuroscience community, I will be
mentored by Dr. Liam Paninski, Dr. Oliver Hobert, and Dr. Attila Losonczy while consulting with Dr. Larry Abbott,
and Dr. Ashok Litwin-Kumar. These professors represent diverse expertise in computational, molecular, and
systems-level neuroscience in C. elegans and rodent models. They will guide me to hone my computational
skills further and provide needed training in molecular and circuit neurobiology during my transition to becoming
an independent computational investigator at the interface of molecular and systems neuroscience."
11027834,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite extensive efforts, current strategies of antibody-gold nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugation chemistries are
not universally applicable to all antibodies, are pH dependent, result in random orientation for diminished activity,
and/or have limited stability. These issues must be addressed to realize the full potential of AuNP-enabled as-
says and promote wide-spread acceptance and implementation in the diagnostics arena. The long-term goal
of this research is to develop a strategy to immobilize antibody onto gold nanoparticles to form highly active,
oriented, and stable conjugates for use in AuNP-enabled immunoassays. Our central hypothesis is that en-
zyme-mediated, site-specific conjugation of a polypeptide to the Fc fragment of an antibody to incorporate multi-
ple thiol groups and a high density of localized positive charge will promote oriented and robust adsorption onto
gold nanoparticles. Our rationale for these studies is that successful completion would drive the novel design of
highly active and stable antibody-gold nanoparticle conjugates critically needed to advance AuNP-enabled plat-
form technologies. Driven by compelling preliminary data, we will test our hypothesis and progress toward our
long-term research goal by completing the following Aims: 1) Enzyme-mediated Modification and Characteriza-
tion of Antibodies; 2) In situ Analysis of Modified Antibody Adsorption onto AuNPs; and 3) Quantitative Analysis
of Antigen-binding Activity for Antibody-AuNP Conjugates. In our previous and ongoing work, we have detailed
the role of localized protein charge and thiol functional groups on the orientation and affinity, respectively, for the
adsorption of proteins to gold nanoparticles. Under the first aim, a short, cysteine- and lysine-rich peptide will be
conjugated to the site-specific Q295 that is conserved on the Fc fragment of the antibody using microbial transglu-
taminase (mTG) and the conjugation will be confirmed by mass spectrometry and protein charge. Under the
second aim, a competitive protein binding assay and nanoparticle tracking analysis, already validated in our lab,
will be used to quantitatively evaluate the binding affinity of the peptide-modified antibody to gold nanoparticles.
Under the last aim, a previously proven enzyme assay will be used to quantify the antigen-binding activity for
bioconjugates formed with unmodified and peptide-modified antibodies. This strategy is innovative because of
the use of a polypeptide as a crosslinking agent between the antibody and the AuNP surface and the use of an
enzyme for site-specific conjugation of the peptide to the Fc region the antibody. The project is significant be-
cause it enables the precise control of antibody adsorption onto gold nanoparticles without protein engineering
and will lead to generalized design principles that provide a streamlined process to optimize immobilization
chemistry to form robust and highly functional nanoparticle probes."
11028501,"Abstract:
Fluorescent biosensor techniques in cell biology now allow for the real-time interrogation of molecular processes
as they occur inside living cells at spatial and temporal resolutions of microns and seconds, respectively. I
have a prior and continued focus on the development of novel Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-
based biosensor technologies that utilize monomeric fluorescent proteins for exceptional sensitivity and probe
reversibility. In addition, a single-chain construction is used to facilitate quantitative analysis. I recently pioneered
the near-infrared (NIR)-FRET biosensor modality, which included the first simultaneous, orthogonal visualization
of cyan-yellow fluorescent protein-based FRET and NIR-FRET biosensors in single living cells. The resulting
data were the first true multiplex analysis of two important molecular switches in living cells, the Rac1 and RhoA
GTPases. This analysis revealed the direct coordination of these GTPases during cell migration in real-time.
Herein, I propose to study the coordination of Rho GTPases associated with important signaling pathways
by designing new biosensors for specific signaling nodes and utilizing the direct multiplex FRET imaging
approach. Specifically, I will first target the local-level coordination of Rho GTPase signaling in fibroblast cells
during migration, chemotaxis, and directional guidance. The coordination of RhoA versus Rac1 GTPases in
fibroblasts will be investigated by determining the role of a downstream target protein, the formin mDia1, which
is hypothesized to coordinate RhoA and Rac1 during cell motility. The direct multiplex imaging approach will be
used to evaluate pairwise biosensor signals. In addition, the RhoA and Rac1 pathways will be perturbed with
optogenetic tools to determine the GTPase coordination that is important for controlling cellular morphodynamics.
Next, these approaches will be applied to two systems that have important implications for human health and
disease. First, macrophage motility and directional guidance, which requires the coordination of Rho GTPases
during the chemotactic response to inflammatory chemokines, will be studied. Then, the multiplex imaging and
perturbation approaches will be applied to breast cancer invasion and migration, which are critical to controlling
tumor metastasis. Collectively, the coordination between Rho GTPases and the associated molecular signaling
that governs cell motility will be identified through the development of new biosensors that enable direct multiplex
probing of signaling networks."

An urgent need exists for new methods to rapidly prepare complex molecules with the potential to become new
drugs. There is a widening gap in both the accessibility of complex core structures that are difficult to exploit and
in the availability of core structures that are not already the subject of numerous patents. This gap will be
addressed by identifying new synthetic methods that achieve the dual goals of enabling efficient access to useful
cores and exploring previously inaccessible ""chemical space."" The long-term goal of our research program is to
understand the reactivity of unstabilized metal carbenes. The objective of this application is to explore the ability
of rhodium donor-donor carbenes to engage in a wide variety of useful new applications. The central hypothesis
is that appending two ""donor"" groups to a carbene opens up new avenues of reactivity for organic chemistry.
This hypothesis is supported by preliminary results regarding a) the unique ability of donor/donor carbenes to
engage in highly enantioselective C–H insertion reactions and b) a new mild and catalytic process for the
formation of reactive dienes for cycloaddition reactions! Small molecules comprise the vast majority of treatments
for both acute and chronic diseases in both the developed and developing world. Research in this application
will lay the groundwork to save lives and enable the next generation of pharmaceutical discovery by focusing on
three areas of research. First, we will explore new C–H insertion reactions the enable the synthesis of complex
carba- and heterocyclic structures, culminating in an efficient synthesis of polycyclic alkaloid natural products
that will be studies for the ability to induce neuroplasticity for the treatment of PTSD, depression and other
neurological disorders. Second, we will explore new reactions of rhodium donor-donor carbenes that branch out
form C–H insertion into new reactions that access new chemotypes. Finally, we will, for the first time, build a
QSSR model that will enable the design, synthesis and exploration of new catalysts that are custom-designed
to enhance the reactivity of donor-donor carbenes. The proposed approach is innovative because it is based on
a new methodological platform that enables previously inaccessible chemical reactivity. This research is
significant because it will change the way synthetic chemists approach targets while at the same time opening
up new vistas for discovery of useful molecules for medicine and other fields. Ultimately, the discoveries
emerging from our research will represent a vertical step in the assembly of molecular architectures that will
translate into new medicines to address our society's most pressing health challenges."
11020034,"Cardiovascular disease has emerged as a significant contributor to cognitive impairment, operating both independently and as a catalyst for the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from low-grade to overt dementia. Amongst all vascular diseases, atherosclerosis stands out because of its prevalence as a common comorbidity in AD patients. Atherosclerosis impairs vascular brain function at multiple levels. First, by directly impacting the circle of Willis and carotid arteries, atherosclerosis leads to narrowing of the vascular lumen, reducing blood flow for the supported regions. Second, rupture of atherosclerotic plaques often leads to thrombosis, resulting in either vessel occlusion or thromboembolisms. Depending on the size of the embolus, it may cause lesions that range from “silent” infarcts or microinfarcts to large cerebral infarcts with overt clinical symptoms. Third, independent of plaques, its associated hyperlipidemia impairs endothelial and smooth muscle cell function in both systemic and brain vessels.  Our investigations into the brain vasculature of mice at the onset of atherosclerosis revealed distinctive vulnerabilities and increased vascular pathology in those with AD amyloid pathology. At the cellular level, perivascular macrophages exhibited prominent alterations in density, distribution, and molecular profile. We also observed dysfunctional permeability, specifically affecting the cortex and hippocampus. Deficiencies in vascular contractility and glymphatic flow were more pronounced in mouse models of AD compared to similarly aged mice without AD pathology. Overall, the findings underscore the impact of atherosclerosis disease on the brain’s microvasculature and provide the underlying impetus to focus on the small vessel disease in response to metabolic lipid deregulation. Our underlying hypothesis posits that hyperlipidemia contributes to vascular dysfunction in both additive and synergistic manners to existing AD pathology. To delve deeper, we propose a comprehensive analysis encompassing structural, molecular, and functional aspects of the vasculature in the context of AD, utilizing two disease models of AD amyloidosis. Crucially, we will evaluate the secretome of endothelial, smooth muscle, pericytes and perivascular macrophages, capturing both intracellular and serum- released proteins as potential cell-specific biomarkers for disease progression. Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether correcting hyperlipidemia, either pharmacologically or by modifying the diet and reversing low-density lipoprotein receptor levels, can restore observed alterations. Correlating these interventions with AD severity will provide important insights into potential therapeutic avenues. In tandem, we plan to develop an integrated computational network that overlays multiple datasets in a spatiotemporal manner, establishing connections with AD pathology. This holistic approach seeks to deepen our understanding of the intricate relationships between vascular health and AD, aiming to inform targeted interventions and therapeutic strategies."

Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation due to challenging work conditions, long work hours, harsh
weather conditions and chronic diseases that result from these exposures. Georgia’s commercial fishermen
represent an aging workforce at risk for penetrating wounds, slips and falls, musculoskeletal strain, and opioid
use and abuse. Although non-fatal injuries are rarely reported, our team has documented a clear need for
relevant first aid and safety training that addresses these risks and improves the safety culture among
commercial fishermen. Existing first aid courses are either not specific to the fishing environment or were
designed for different climates and working conditions than in Georgia. Besides operating in a warm-water
climate, Georgia’s commercial fishermen also target different species and generally operate differently than the
commercial fishing industry in the Pacific northwest. Fishing operations are generally small-scale and are
owned and operated independently, with many fishermen working alone. We intend to focus our regional
adaptation of FFAST (Southeast and Gulf Coast FFAST; SGC-FFAST) for participants in the two largest
commercial fisheries in the state (shrimp and blue crab). The proposed training program will employ a
systematic, community-based approach to translate the existing Fishermen First Aid and Safety Training
(FFAST) designed for fishermen in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest into a program with potential for broad
dissemination in the Southeast and Gulf Coast (SGC-FFAST). Georgia fishermen and additional relevant
stakeholders will be engaged throughout the process. First, we will conduct key informant interviews and focus
groups to translate the FFAST content, implementation, and evaluation methodology for fishermen in Georgia
(Aim 1). Our second aim is to pilot test and refine SGC-FFAST content, activities, and assessment materials
with a core group of fishermen. Finally, we will implement and evaluate SGC-FFAST across coastal Georgia,
assessing participant knowledge and skill competency (Aim 3). Our approach is centered on respect for the
fishing community and their autonomy in the translation of FFAST. Our methodology is clearly aligned with the
Research to Practice (r2p) approach. We will leverage long-established relationships with commercial
fishermen, their families, dock workers, the US Coast Guard, and other stakeholders to partner on the
adaptation of content, activities, and assessment (Aim 1). We also will invite members of the fishing community
to observe and provide feedback on the pilot test (Aim 2) and final course (Aim 3), keeping open lines of
communication. High levels of community engagement will help to cultivate a culture of safety and meet the
training needs of commercial fishermen in Georgia. Our systematic and robust methodology optimizes the
potential for scalability across the Southeast and Gulf Coast with long-term impacts of reducing injury and
mortality among Georgia commercial fishermen, improving community capacity for safety training and quality
of life for the fishing community."

Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in epilepsy children and
otherwise healthy adult epilepsy patients, with a cumulative lifetime risk of ~8%. About 70% of SUDEP occurs
during sleep, and nearly 90% are found in the prone (face-down) position. SUDEP can likely be prevented by
simple interventions such as turning and stimulating. Such intervention must be performed quickly within a 3-
minute window prior to death. Soterya, Inc. was founded with the mission to develop technologies to decrease
the risk of SUDEP. We plan to address this critical unmet medical need with significant market potential with a
smart mattress, the Korus. There are currently no products that detect the prone position or have the ability to
physically reposition a patient into a recovery position. In the Phase I SBIR, we developed an advanced
prototype with advanced expandable cells generating necessary lift with a 1000 lb/cell capacity and an
embedded sensor system that rapidly detects body change with an accuracy of >95% for detecting the prone
position. Aim 1 this Phase II SBIR is to construct enhanced hardware and develop software for completely
autonomous repositioning a patient from the prone to recovery (sideways) position. An advanced bed
environment simulation with a “Digital Twin” mirroring patient action will be created. Using this environment, a
biomechanical framework focusing on 16 key anatomical landmarks for body articulation and machine learning
will be utilized to develop optimal strategies for repositioning. This data will be utilized by a control system that
will activate the appropriate smart cells for surface reshaping. Normative control subjects (10 total) will be
recruited for overnight studies to assess the accuracy in determining body position within 5 seconds, and
autonomously repositioning from the prone to a recovery position within 30 seconds. Aim 2 of this study is to
assess body positioning recognition utilizing the Korus sheet sensor system in patients after generalized tonic-
clonic seizures. Testing will be performed through our academic partners at the Brigham and Women’s
Hospital epilepsy service. Epilepsy patients (50 total) admitted to the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit will be recruited
to assess the accuracy of the Korus sensing system in detecting body position changes in both the ictal and
postictal phases. The completion of this project will position Soterya for the development of a fully functional
device that will be utilized in a clinical trial to autonomously and safely prevent prone positioning of patients
with epilepsy."
11008522,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s Disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function
and a corresponding accumulation of β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the two hallmark
pathologies. Drugs currently available to AD patients manage the disease symptoms by improving neuronal
activity, but efficacy diminishes as the disease advances. In tauopathies such as AD, the accumulation of tau
correlates closely with neuronal loss and decline of cognitive function. The novel targeted approach to AD drug
development proposed by Aquinnah Pharmaceuticals stems from discoveries made by Dr. Ben Wolozin (Boston
University and co-founder of Aquinnah) and his laboratory, in which tau pathology (in both AD brain samples and
animal models) was observed in stress granules (SG). Aquinnah is advancing these compelling findings to further
the development of novel molecules that inhibit the formation of tau-SGs as a novel treatment for AD that were
identified characterized in SBIR Phase II. The overall objective of this Phase IIB application is to begin IND-
enabling studies to advance our novel compounds for the treatment of AD."

Cūrza is developing a new class of broad-spectrum antibiotics, focused on multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-
negative pathogens. The CZ-02 program is directed towards inhibitors that bind to a unique site on the bacterial
ribosome that is not targeted by approved antibiotics and have not encountered cross-resistance to other
antibiotics used clinically. Inspired by a natural product, analogs have been developed that selectively inhibit
bacterial protein synthesis, with little effect on mammalian protein synthesis, through a binding interaction with
the ribosome at a clinically un-drugged site. The natural product that inspired CZ-02s has multiple metabolic
liabilities and lacks activity against Gram-negative pathogens. However, after re-engineering the natural
product’s minimum pharmacophore responsible for activity into new chemical matter, the resulting compounds
are metabolically stable, exhibit excellent selectivity and potency for bacterial protein synthesis while sparing
mammalian ribosomes and are efficacious against MDR pathogens in vitro and in vivo; all while displaying a lack
of cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells and avoiding effects on mitochondrial function. The proposed SBIR
project will ultimately deliver a new orally administered antibiotic candidate that is potent with broad-spectrum
activity and efficacy, focusing on Gram-negative pathogens.
This Direct Phase II project will advance the CZ-02 program by the following aims. Aim 1 will pursue parallel
paths for oral bioavailability of CZ-02s. One will adopt formulation technologies that have proven successful for
other therapeutics to maximizing oral bioavailability for either of 2 late preclinical stage CZ-02s.The second will
pursue a medicinal chemistry approach for optimizing physicochemical properties of CZ-02s to impart inherent
oral bioavailability to the scaffold. Rigorous microbiological and biochemical evaluation along with profiling of
absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADME-Tox) will guide optimization efforts. Aim 2 will
use in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation to guide optimization along with maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
determination to guide in vivo efficacy initially in mouse septicemia models to select lead compounds for
evaluation in complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) models of K. pneumoniae and E. coli (the pathogens most
responsible for cUTIs) for down-selection to a single lead candidate. Aim 3 will provide scale-up chemistry to
support in vivo studies. Aim 4 has sophisticated PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) profiling to establish the PD driver
of efficacy and definition of the optimal dosing regimen in acute pyelonephritis (AP) models.
At the culmination of the project, a lead compound will be ready for two species non-GLP toxicology and
subsequent IND-enabling studies to ultimately deliver a new antibiotic from a novel class targeting Gram-
negative pathogens."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death among young children worldwide, with most cases
occurring in low and middle-income countries. Children who survive pneumonia have an increased risk of
impaired lung development, reduced lung function, and chronic respiratory disease in adulthood. Our
preliminary data from an ongoing cohort study in Uganda demonstrate a high rate of chronic respiratory
symptoms among children who had a prior episode of pneumonia and near-universal exposure to household
air pollution from biomass fuel combustion. Reducing household air pollution may provide an opportunity to
improve lung development in children with pneumonia and prevent development of chronic respiratory disease.
My central hypothesis is that infants recovering from pneumonia are at particularly increased risk of reduced
lung function growth when exposed to household air pollution, and that reducing exposure to household air
pollution will improve lung function growth. In this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award,
I will test this hypothesis within my mentors’ already established study of 8,700 children in Uganda through an
observational study and pilot intervention trial with the following Specific Aims: (1) to measure the effect of
pneumonia on the rate of lung function growth among young infants, (2) to measure the effect of particulate
matter exposure (PM2.5) on lung function growth, and (3) to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a
clean cookstove intervention in families of young infants with pneumonia. The accompanying training plan will
allow me to build on an existing foundation of clinical and epidemiologic skills to (1) develop expertise in infant
lung physiology and testing, (2) develop expertise in household air pollution research methods, and (3) develop
skills in qualitative research and clinical trial design for low-resource settings. This study will provide critical
preliminary data and a training platform to launch my career as an independent investigator in global
respiratory research, with a long-term goal of understanding the mechanisms of impaired lung development
and developing interventions to improve respiratory health for children and adults living in low-income
countries. Supported by mentors and collaborators who are internationally-known experts in pneumonia,
household air pollution, infant lung function, qualitative research, and clinical trial design, the proposed
research will leverage the wealth of resources available at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical
School and a longstanding collaboration with Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda. This
proposal addresses NHLBI’s Strategic Vision Objective #4, to investigate factors that account for differences in
health among populations, and is directly responsive to a research gap identified in the 2014 NHLBI Workshop
on the Primary Prevention of Chronic Lung Diseases, to study how early childhood exposures affect
development of lung function and subsequent risk of COPD and other chronic respiratory diseases."
11022758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This K23 Career Development Award is designed to provide the conceptual knowledge and technical
skills necessary for the PI to pursue a career as an independent investigator evaluating brain network targets
to optimize non-pharmacologic interventions for difficult-to-treat mood and cognitive disturbances in aging.
 Apathy is a persistent and disabling disorder of motivation that afflicts 30-50% of patients with late-life
depression (LLD). Apathy worsens clinical outcomes in LLD, as apathetic depressed patients have poor
response to existing treatments and higher rates of hospitalization, functional decline, and increased caregiver
burden. Functional network abnormalities in a core set of brain circuits that interact to support motivated
behavior (salience, executive control, and reward networks) may underlie apathy of LLD. Options for the
efficacious treatment of apathy of LLD are limited, and novel interventions are urgently needed.
 This proposal is based on the premise that customizing interventions based on theorized brain
mechanisms of apathy may increase the potency and scalability of promising therapies. This K23 proposes to
conduct a randomized controlled trial evaluating the potential of a customized digital cognitive training (DCT)
intervention to target brain network abnormalities in apathy of LLD and reduce symptoms of apathy and related
cognitive and behavioral deficits. Eighty-four older adults with major depressive disorder and clinically
significant apathy will be randomized to four weeks of a home-based DCT intervention or an active
expectancy-matched control. The DCT will involve a suite of exercises designed to engage brain networks
disrupted in apathy by targeting cognitive processes (i.e., salience processing, sustained attention, cognitive
control) supported by these networks. Aligned with NIMH’s experimental therapeutics approach, we will
examine the extent to which a targeted DCT program modulates functional network disturbances in apathy of
LLD and improves apathy and associated cognitive deficits. The proposed study will generate preliminary data
regarding network targets of a customized digital therapeutic that may translate to mood and cognitive benefits,
and may guide future personalization of treatments for motivational disturbances in older adulthood.
 The training provided through this K23 will advance my knowledge and skillsets in: 1) the design and
delivery of a neuroscience-informed, virtually-delivered intervention targeting a distinct subtype of depressed
older adults; 2) use of functional MRI to probe mechanisms of action of the proposed DCT; 3) advanced
longitudinal modeling of clinical trial data to assess trajectories of change and identify predictors of response
and; 4) generating an R-series experimental therapeutics target engagement application. This training will
prepare me for an independent research career developing and refining neuroscience-based interventions
targeting traditionally intractable and functionally impairing mood and cognitive disturbances in older adulthood."
11022874,"The goal of this project is to understand reservoir effects and curative potential of a promising
CCR5-depleting bispecific antibody (bsAb) given with days of ART initiation to infants with either
limited or robust pre-ART viral replication. The agent is a bsAb with one arm directed against CD3 and
the other against CCR5, which approximates cytotoxic T cells to CCR5-expressing cells. These cells form a
key part of the HIV reservoir in ART-treated people and have been eliminated in notable cases of HIV cure.
Our preclinical studies revealed >50% remission in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected infant
animals after bsAb treatment. We hypothesize that these effects were achieved through a combination of
true reservoir depletion and removal of SIV target cells required for rebound.
In this R01 application, we propose to improve the manufacturing and safety of this bispecific antibody and
then rigorously test the two proposed mechanisms of action. We will screen early-infected infants to identify
those with either (i) limited viral replication and the potential for cure, or (ii) robust replication and likelihood
of establishing measurable reservoirs that can be followed during and after bsAb treatment. These two
groups will be separately studied in order to isolate and measure reservoir effects and the potential for cure.
Hypothesis: Highly purified CD3/CCR5 bsAb, given within days of ART initiation, safely achieves significant
SIV reservoir depletion from infants, which is sufficient to induce durable remission in those with restricted
reservoirs or can act synergistically with bnAb to achieve remission in animals with larger reservoirs.
Aim 1. Test CCR5 depletion and side effects caused by CD3/CCR5 bsAb produced as a CrossMab,
compared to controlled Fab-arm exchange (cFAE).
Aim 2. Demonstrate the potential for infant SIV cure via CCR5 depletion near the time of ART
initiation, when viral replication and reservoirs are limited.
Aim 3. Measure the interference with reservoir establishment that is achievable by CCR5 depletion,
bnAb, or the two combined in early-treated infants with robust viral replication."
11022900,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While the advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality
associated with HIV infection, viral eradication is not achievable due to the persistence of latently-infected cells
during treatment. Accumulating data suggest that HIV-infected individuals often experience persistent immune
dysregulation, chronic inflammation, and accelerated aging even in the setting of ART-mediated viral
suppression. These realities have created a pronounced interest in developing strategies to eradicate or
functionally cure HIV infection.
Recent work from our group and others has demonstrated a highly important and pleiotropic role of human
galectin-9 (Gal-9), an immunoregulatory β-galactoside-binding lectin, in HIV persistence. We have
demonstrated that administration of Gal-9 potently reactivates latent HIV in CD4+ T cells, by signaling through
specific glycans on the target cell surface. We have additionally revealed that Gal-9 expression in tissues (e.g.
CNS) spatially overlaps with HIV infection, and high levels of endogenous, circulating Gal-9 in plasma are
strongly associated with long-term maintenance of intact HIV proviral DNA in the CD4+ T cell compartment
during ART. Moreover, our recent studies in HIV-infected humanized mice have revealed that exogenously
administered Gal-9 significantly increases tissue-associated HIV DNA and RNA levels. In this study, we will
comprehensively determine if therapeutic inhibition of Gal-9 signaling at the time of ART initiation can
accelerate clearance of the latent HIV reservoir, resolve HIV-associated inflammation, and prevent viral
rebound following ART cessation. These goals are well aligned with the stated objective of PAR-23-297.
In Aim 1 of our study, we will use established ex vivo latency models to elucidate the molecular and
immunologic mechanisms underlying Gal-9-mediated expansion of the HIV reservoir. In Aim 2, we will
determine how manipulation (supplementation or blockade) of Gal-9 signaling impacts the HIV reservoir and
viral rebound kinetics post-ART cessation in vivo. Our multidisciplinary investigative team at Vitalant Research
Institute / UCSF, Weill Cornell Medicine, and Yale University brings a diverse systems biology approach to
investigate the impact of Gal-9 on HIV persistence, including tools developed by our group to manipulate Gal-9
signaling in vitro and in vivo (recombinant, stable form exogenous Gal-9, and a panel of anti-Gal-9 monoclonal
antibodies that interfere with its virologic effects). Our translational design will leverage carefully designed ex
vivo models of HIV persistence, clinical samples from people living with HIV (PLWH) on suppressive ART, and
two complementary murine models of HIV latency. Our findings will guide the development of novel HIV cure
strategies that leverage the immunomodulatory activities of host galectins."
11018912,"Abstract:
Defining how the bone marrow functions under stress is indispensable to understand
hematopoiesis during disease. A major limitation in the field is that most studies (including those
from our group) have ignored the fact that hematopoiesis takes place in multiple bones. Instead,
the field has largely focused on investigating hematopoiesis in long bones – as these are readily
accessible and yield large amounts of hematopoietic cells for analyses- and assumed that the
rest of the skeleton behaved in a similar manner. We have demonstrated that the bone marrow
response to a hematopoietic insult is dramatically different depending on the bone examined. In
this proposal we want to understand the cellular mechanisms driving these heterogeneous
responses.
We have found that -after treatment with G-CSF- the sternum shows reduced numbers of
neutrophils and neutrophil progenitors while long bones show expansions in these populations.
In response to hemorrhage both the sternum and the tibia increase erythrocyte production,
however, the skull fails to increase erythropoiesis. Based on this we hypothesize: a) the bone
marrow response to stress is variable across the skeleton; b) some bones have specialized to
preferentially respond to specific insults; c) this is non-autonomously regulated by the unique
composition -and anatomy- of the microenvironment in each bone.
We will test this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1 we will determine how bone marrow
macrophages control the differential response to G-CSF in sternum vs long-bones. In Aim 2 we
will whether competition between erythroid progenitors and trabecular bone controls stress
erythropoiesis."
11020360,"PROJECT SUMMARY
All pathogens possess genetic diversity that can impact clinically relevant phenotypes such as virulence,
susceptibility to drugs, and vaccine efficacy. In the post-genomic era, our ability to catalog microbial genotypes
has far outstripped our capacity to profile microbial phenotypes. This limits our ability to build genotype-
phenotype maps for traits of interest and hinders the development of broadly effective new antimicrobials,
vaccines, and public health interventions. To address this challenge, I developed a molecular barcoding
approach that permits parallel fitness phenotyping of hundreds of bacterial clinical isolates in a single in vitro or
in vivo experiment. I developed and validated this novel approach in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis
and uncovered strain-specific differences in bacterial fitness during infection and following vaccination in the
mouse model. Here, I propose to use this novel tool to interrogate the genetic basis of phenotypic
heterogeneity in a related mycobacterial pathogen, Mycobacterium avium (MAC). MAC is an environmental
microbe that can cause chronic and treatment-recalcitrant infections and is increasing in incidence. A major
challenge in the management of MAC disease is the variability in disease course and treatment outcome, and
the bacterial determinants of this variability are unknown. Here, I will leverage my strain barcoding approach
and the natural biodiversity of this microbe to elucidate genetic determinants and molecular mechanisms of
MAC pathogenicity and antibiotic response. These efforts will inform the development of improved diagnostics
and therapeutics for this, and other, chronic bacterial infections. More broadly, this work will provide an
intellectual framework and experimental toolkit to uncover the biological basis of heterogeneity in infectious
disease phenotypes."
11008599,"Project Summary/Abstract
Microglia-induced neuroinflammation (MiN) plays a critical role in many neurological disorders,
contributing to disease progression and symptomology. In Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE),
hippocampal sclerosis (HS) forms a nidus for persistent MiN that is associated with chronic
epileptic seizures. MiN presents a novel therapeutic target and represents a complementary
therapeutic approach to current anti-seizure medications. TLE is the most common form of drug
resistant epilepsy, impacting 200,000 Americans, and resulting in significant morbidity and
mortality. Discovery of compounds active against MiN have been based almost exclusively on
screening in an immortalized murine BV2 cell model stimulated with pathogenic LPS to induce
neuroinflammation. However, this is a poor surrogate for human TLE-related neuroinflammation
and models with greater fidelity to TLE are critically needed for successful translation.
Stem Pharm’s proprietary human stem cell derived neural organoids allow for incorporation of
microglia in a reproducible, 96-well plate format amenable to drug screening applications. We
have demonstrated that microglia incorporated into our organoids demonstrate a gene signature
that strongly correlates with human in vivo microglia, respond appropriately to inflammatory
stimuli, and model features of neuroinflammation related to TLE. While LPS stimulation can
produce a form of MiN in vitro, it is based on pathogen signaling largely through the TLR4
receptor. In contrast, we will stimulate Stem Pharm’s organoids with Damage Associated
Molecular Pattern (DAMP) molecules that interact with a broad set of microglial receptors and cell
signaling pathways. This is expected to produce MiN more closely resembling that found in TLE
and result in a more effective and translatable drug discovery model. Specific Aims will 1) develop
and characterize DAMP cocktails or DAMP-enriched conditioned media (CM) that optimally
stimulate MiN, 2) apply optimized DAMP cocktails/CM that elicit neuroinflammatory responses in
organoids and assess transcriptional changes with comparison to TLE patient data, and 3)
validate the organoid model by evaluating the ability of known anti-inflammatory compounds to
prevent DAMP-induced MiN. Completion of these aims will result in an in vitro DAMP-based model
of MiN with demonstrable relevance to TLE. This will represent a significant advancement in the
ability to evaluate anti-inflammatory activity of candidate therapeutics in a physiologically relevant
model. A Phase 2 proposal will focus on screening drug candidates capable of regulating
microglia activation in TLE and performing preclinical activities."

CMTx Biotech is a drug development company working to commercialize a pipeline of proprietary, non-
antibiotic, chemically-modified tetracycline (CMT) compositions and formulations for the host-modulatory
treatment of diseases with high unmet needs, including a proprietary, clinical-stage, orally-administered small-
molecule drug candidate, incyclinide (CMT-3 / COL-3), as a medical countermeasure for the treatment of
exposure to vesicants (blister agents) that may occur in chemical warfare, terrorism or industrial accidents.
Vesicating agents, including distilled mustard (HD), mustard gas (H), mustard/lewisite, mustard/T, nitrogen
mustard, sesqui mustard, and sulfur mustard, can cause moderate to debilitating injuries and pain to the eye,
skin, and mucous membranes. The primary modes of exposure are through contact, inhalation and ingestion.
Depending on the dose, route, and duration of exposure, toxic symptoms can range in varying degrees of
ocular and dermal burns, blister formation, bronchospasm, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, bronchitis, and
immune- and bone marrow suppression. Sulfur mustard is a human-made chemical warfare agent that causes
blistering of the skin and mucous membranes on contact. Vesicating chemicals have been identified by the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as
highly toxic chemicals of concern to public health security due to the devastating health effects of exposure.
Unfortunately, no known antidote exists for sulfur mustard exposure. Treatment consists of removing sulfur
mustard from the body as soon as possible and providing supportive medical care in a hospital setting or by
trained emergency personnel. There remains a critical need for safe and effective medical countermeasures
for the treatment of acute and chronic lung injuries caused by the inhalation of SM. The market for treatments
specifically targeting sulfur mustard exposure is relatively limited to purchases by the U.S. Strategic National
Stockpile and international equivalents. However, companies that secure FDA approval for a medical
countermeasure (MCM) against certain chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) threats are eligible
to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV), which allows the recipient to expedite the review of a future New
Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) for a different product of their choice. PRVs
can be sold or transferred to other companies, with an average value of approximately $100M. Our lead drug
candidate is a pleiotropic matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) modulator which inhibits pathologically-excessive
collagenolysis and resolves systemic inflammation. Safety of the compound has already been demonstrated in
Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies. The drug has been evaluated in several clinical trials for the
treatment of diseases as disparate as AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma, recurrent high-grade gliomas, refractory
metastatic cancer, acne, rosacea and periodontitis. The Specific Aims of this STTR are (a) to demonstrate a
dose-dependent survival benefit of incyclinide (25mg/kg, 50mg/kg, or 100mg/kg by oral gavage) in an
established rat model of sulfur mustard (SM) inhalation with daily treatment initiated 24-hours post-SM
exposure and continued for 28 days, and (b) to evaluate the effect of orally-administered incyclinide on the
pathogenesis of SM-induced lung injury, pulmonary fibrosis and inflammatory biomarkers. Our long-term goal
is to secure FDA approval for incyclinide as a safe and effective medical countermeasure for SM-induced lung
injury. We anticipate that our drug candidate will improve survival and mitigate SM-induced lung injury in
exposed rats, reduce SM-induced injury parameters as assessed through histopathology, as well as lung
fibrosis and key inflammatory biomarkers. Successful completion of these studies will allow CMTx Biotech to
(a) evaluate our drug candidate in non-rodent animal model of SM-induced lung injury, (b) prepare and submit
a pre-IND meeting request and briefing document, and (c) scale-up production of the drug substance and drug
product under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP)."

who have sex with men (LMSM) and the extent to which these network structures and characteristics can
influence LMSM access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) information and the distribution of HIV self-testing

egos and 153 alters). Second data source: qualitative data including 90-minute semi-structured individual
interviews with LMSM online gamers (N=40). Both data sources include information from LMSM living in Miami-
Dade County, Florida, (MDC), the metropolitan statistical area with the highest HIV incidence (42.4 per 100,000)

LMSM online gamers. It will include the description of network size, type of games played, frequency of gameplay
with others, format of gameplay, and the sociodemographic characteristics of their online gaming partners. Aim
2: Understand the potential reach of LMSM online gamers to promote PrEP messaging and disseminate HIVST
kits in their offline friendship networks. Egocentric and two-mode network analyses will be used to: (A) determine
the structures of offline friendship and affiliation networks of LMSM online gamers, and (B) identify specific
characteristics of these structures (e.g., type of games played, homogeneity, homophily) associated with the
dissemination of PrEP information and distribution of HIVST kits. Aim 3: Explore the acceptability of a combined
online game and offline friendship networks-based approach to promote PrEP information and HIVST kit
dissemination. Qualitative findings will inform the design of an intervention that bundles social network and online
game-based approaches to increase PrEP/HIVST awareness and uptake. Implications. This F31 study will
inform the development and implementation of culturally-tailored game- and social network-based interventions
to enhance HIV prevention services for LMSM and the applicant’s future K99/R00 award development."

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful and debilitating joint
disease that can result in joint pain, loss of joint
function, and deleterious effects on the quality of daily life. Despite recent advances in drug development, there
is no disease-modifying drug available to delay OA progression or reverse the disease. Over 600,000 knee
replacements are performed each year in the US. Many preclinical and clinical studies have revealed that various
inflammatory mediators have been implicated in OA pathogenesis.
inflammation and OA, a major challenge is how to resolve the inflammatory state
Despite the strong association between
since common anti-
inflammatory drugs have demonstrated limited utility to slow or reverse OA progression. Moreover, rapid joint
clearance and poor penetration into avascular cartilage tissues further limit the clinical application of many
promising OA drugs. Therefore, there remains a critical need to identify new therapeutic targets and to develop
effective drug delivery systems for OA patients. Secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) enzyme specifically
hydrolyzes the sn-2 ester bond of phospholipids, releasing free fatty acids and lysophospholipids. These
products are well-known upstream inflammation mediators in many chronic inflammatory diseases. However,
few studies have explored the role of sPLA2 in OA and the cause-effect relationship between sPLA2 upregulation
and OA progression. Our recent studies found that sPLA2 level is drastically increased in full-thickness articular
cartilage from both human patients and animal models of OA
. To explore the potential of targeting sPLA2 pathway
(i.e. by sPLA2 inhibitor, sPLA2i) for OA treatment and overcome the challenges of small sPLA2i delivery within
joints (i.e. rapid clearance and poor cartilage penetration), we engineered sPLA2i (thioetheramide-PC)-loaded
phospholipid micellar nanoparticles (thioetheramide-NPs) and provided the first evidence that thioetheramide-
NPs, but not free sPLA2i, can effectively reduce joint inflammation, alleviate join pain and prevent OA progression
in a mouse OA model. While these data are promising, thioetheramide-PC is not a clinically-approved drug and
has a rather poor IC50 (~2 µM). The overall goal of this proposal is to use a clinically tested and more potent
sPLA2i varespladib (~210-fold lower IC50 than thioetheramide-PC) to construct sPLA2-responsive varespladib-
NPs and test their efficacy in clinically relevant animal models. We believe the proposed work will result in a
clinically translatable nanotechnology that could alter the standard of care for knee OA. The specific aims for the
proposal are 1) synthesize and optimize sPLA2-responsive varespladib-NPs; 2) evaluate the efficacy of
varespladib-NPs in injury-induced mouse OA models; and 3) evaluate the efficacy of varespladib-NPs in the
guinea pig model of spontaneous OA."

 My long-term career goal is to become a successful independent investigator in the field of
musculoskeletal regenerative medicine, developing therapeutics to promote the regeneration of complex tissues
after injury or disease. The objective of this proposal is to help me transition to independence by providing me
with critical scientific skills to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of murine digit tip regeneration
versus fibrotic scarring. To reach this objective, a thorough training plan has been established, including research
aims and tailored training activities. The proposed research project will seek to develop a novel mouse model
and an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) in vitro culture system in order to dissect the functional role of
regulatory genes involved in embryonic limb development and morphogenesis, including Hox genes. The central
hypothesis of the proposal is that HoxA cluster genes, and specifically Hoxa13, are required during digit
regeneration to coordinate osteogenic differentiation, outgrowth, and patterning via Eph/ephrin and bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. We will investigate this hypothesis by conditionally deleting HoxA cluster
genes from osteoblast lineage cells in transgenic mice in Aim 1 and by modulating Hoxa13 gene expression in
iPSCs in vitro using a lentiviral-mediated approach in Aims 2 and 3a. Finally, we will evaluate the therapeutic
potential of Hoxa13-expressing cells delivered to the wound site of non-regenerative digits in Aim 3b. The project
outlined in this application combines basic science with a clinically relevant in vivo platform and cutting-edge
transcriptomic and bioinformatic technologies to query the gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways that
lead to regeneration versus scarring after musculoskeletal injury. This proposal also includes a comprehensive
series of educational activities that will prepare me for my independent research faculty position. The world-class
institutional environment at Washington University in St. Louis provides a multitude of resources to ensure the
successful completion of the proposed work, as well as ample opportunities for career development. Finally, the
assembled Scientific and Career Advisory Committee, along with new mentoring relationships that I am fostering
in the developmental and regenerative biology communities, will monitor research progress, provide constructive

SCD is a heritable disease, which affects a patient's red blood cells (RBCs). This monogenic disorder is
caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within the HBB gene. Despite progress in the treatment
of SCD regarding early screenings, prevention of infections, and blood transfusions, the life expectancy for
SCD patients is still reduced by about 30 years. Currently, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment available. Unfortunately, the process is invasive and
associated with high risk of graft-versus-host-disease, infection, and infertility. CRISPR-based gene editing
is a powerful therapeutic tool for potentially curing a wide variety of diseases. However, low editing
efficiency can result in unedited HSPCs outcompeting edited ones, resulting in diminished therapeutic
impact. Current methods for maximizing the percentage of edited cells rely on GFP or surface protein
sequences to be contained within the homologous donor DNA, complex optical assays and cell sorting to
establish cell populations with >85% editing efficiency. We propose to develop a versatile and easy-to-use
platform to monitor and optimize the editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 for SCD gene therapy
applications. This in vitro platform utilizes multiplex CRISPR-transistors to quantify the amount of a
specific sequence within an unamplified genomic DNA sample without the bias associated with the artifacts
of library preparation like other sequencing-based methods. The electronic platform provides rapid readout
with low sample input requirement. By combining the programmability of RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas
technology with the scalability of nano-electronics, the proposed project provides a flexible, and simple to
use ex-vivo monitoring solution for a comprehensive and effective gene therapy quality control. We
will expand CRISPR-transistor design in Aim 1 to yield a sensor which employs a variety of gRNA designs
and RNA-guided Cas nucleases to electronically detect and quantify single nucleotide changes using SCD
as a genetic model. In Aim 2, we will scale up this technology design and fabricate a multiplex gFET
capable of analyzing a single sample with up to 16 different RNA-guided Cas complexes simultaneously
without amplification. In Aim 3, we will utilize this multi-plex CRISPR-transistor platform to rapidly assess
the ex-vivo CRISPR/Cas9 HBB editing efficiency of HSPCs from patients with SCD. In addition, we will
leverage the flexibility of CRISPR-transistor to establish an ON/OFF-target evaluation of the RNA-guided
Cas nuclease in the presence of chromatin structures and compare against existing technologies for off-
target screening, like CIRCLE-seq and genome wide. This project will demonstrate a facile, general
platform for quantification of editing efficiency that has the potential to shorten the processing time,
reducing sample and complexity necessary to ensure high quality of ex-vivo gene therapy."
11019005,"Young people are arrested at high rates in the U.S., particularly in minoritized communities, and face stark
behavioral health disparities related to substance use and sexual health compared with peers who have not
been arrested. Low emotion regulation appears to be a common mechanism underpinning these disparities and
it can be improved via mindfulness meditation. Moreover, meditation can be taught by smartphone app, holding
the potential to reach youth on probation—who make up the large majority of all young people in the legal
system—in their daily lives. In a prior NIDA-funded study (K99/R00DA047890), we collaborated closely with
youth and other stakeholders in Chicago Cook County, the 2nd largest juvenile legal system in the U.S., to identify
determinants of implementing a 1-month mindfulness meditation app with youth on probation, develop a package
of corresponding implementation strategies to promote app adherence (i.e., ongoing usage), and run a fully-
remote pilot RCT with n=70 youth on probation. The pilot data strongly supported feasibility and acceptability
including very high objective app adherence (mean=20.40 of 30 daily meditations, SD=7.99) and retention at 1
(86%) and 6 (80%) months. There were also multiple signals of greater reductions in substance use problems
and sexual risk behaviors among youth randomized to the meditation app than to a health promotion control app
matched for time and structure. Throughout the pilot RCT, youth and officers requested that the meditation app
be sustained in probation programming if it demonstrates effectiveness. This proposal is a response to our
stakeholders’ requests. The proposed study will proceed in 2 main steps corresponding to (1) testing the
effectiveness and individual-level implementation of the meditation app, and (2) starting to plan for its
sustainability on the organizational level. First, we will leverage our successful pilot RCT design to run a hybrid
type 2 effectiveness-implementation RCT with N=300 youth on probation in Cook County. Youth will be
randomized to use the meditation or health control app daily for 30 days. Objective usage data will identify non-
use of both apps and trigger adherence support (e.g., texts) via an adaptive intervention design. Youth will report
on the health outcomes (substance use and sexual health) and the mechanistic target (emotion regulation) at
baseline, 1, and 6 months. They will also complete 1-week “bursts” of ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
at baseline and 1 month to supplement the retrospective emotion regulation data with real-time, ecologically valid
reports. Together, this will allow us to test if the meditation app is effective in reducing substance use problems
and sexual risk (Aim 1a), if improvements in emotion regulation mediate these effects (Aim 1b), and if youth
adequately adhere to the app (Aim 2). To start systematically planning for sustainability of the meditation app in
probation programming (Aim 3), we will interview youth on probation, probation officers, and probation leadership
on organizational-level determinants of sustaining the app and implementation strategies for doing so. We will
then run a pilot sustainability trial with N=20 youth to test feasibility and acceptability of those strategies."

Leading to over 270,000 deaths in the US annually, septicemia is the systemic inflammatory response to a
bloodstream infection (BSI). Early diagnosis and treatment of BSIs have demonstrated improved patient
outcomes and reduced hospitalization time. However, currently accepted diagnostic approaches have not
advanced substantially since the advent of automated blood culturing systems. As such, today’s gold-standard,
is not only slow, requiring ~1-3 days, but also demonstrates reduced sensitivity in the presence of antimicrobial
treatment. There is therefore a significant need for new diagnostic approaches that do not require culture and
provide faster, more accurate results.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID/BSI, a fully automated sample-to-answer test which
identifies and characterizes BSIs directly from blood in ~3 hours, without cultures. Implemented on the RaPID
(Resistance and Pathogen IDentification) platform and appropriate for placement throughout the hospital,
RaPID/BSI incorporates a broad test menu of 21 bacterial and fungal pathogens and is not compromised by prior
antimicrobial treatment. Species level detail is provided with single CFUs/ml sensitivity, enabling selection of
appropriate antimicrobials. Commercialization of RaPID/BSI will provide timely characterization of BSIs and
thus enable intervention with targeted antimicrobial treatment. This is expected to result in improved patient
outcomes and a reduction in the use of unnecessary antimicrobials, slowing the rise of antimicrobial resistance.
Reflecting RaPID/BSI’s significant advantages over exiting alternatives and the potential to improve care and
quality of life, the FDA designated RaPID/BSI a Breakthrough Technology in 2020.
HelixBind has met and exceeded all of the Specific Aims defined in the Phase II SBIR. This included assay
optimization, automation of the assay onto a single-use plastic disposable operated by a benchtop instrument
and testing of clinical specimens. Clinical results demonstrating >94% sensitivity and 99.8% specificity across
the assay far surpassed our milestone of 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. In addition, based on feedback from
potential customers, the test menu was expanded from 16 to 21 pathogens and the capability to detect resistance
mechanisms was demonstrated.
Given the success of Phase II, HelixBind proposes in this Commercialization Readiness Pilot program proposal
to mature the manufacturing of the RaPID/BSI disposable; ensuring quality and sufficient scale to support
regulatory clearance and initial launch. In addition, this proposal will support the expansion of the RaPID
Analyzer’s software suite, addressing core issues as cyber security and connectivity to hospital Electronic Health
Records in a HIPAA compliant manner. Upon completion of this project, we will be well placed to initiate formal
Analytical and Clinical studies for FDA clearance of RaPID/BSI."

With the increasing prevalence of obesity, the health burden of obesity-driven diseases such as
type 2 diabetes (T2D) has risen markedly. T2D is now one of the most prevalent diseases
worldwide and exacts a tremendous toll population-wide in terms of decreased lifespan and
health-span. In T2D, hyperglycemia follows from impairment in pancreatic beta-cell insulin
production and insulin resistance in the liver and other metabolically active tissues.
Pioneering research from the Pajvani laboratory has implicated obesity-driven reactivation of the
Notch signaling pathway, previously thought to be only active during development and
organogenesis, as a crucial driver of hepatic insulin resistance. Forced activation of hepatocyte
Notch pathway signaling in mouse models is sufficient to cause glucose intolerance in chow-fed
mice. In contrast, overexpression of upstream components of Notch pathway signaling in
hepatocytes does not cause hyperglycemia unless an obesogenic diet is also provided,
implicating other, as yet unknown, nodes in the Notch pathway in the propagation of
maladaptive signals in obesity. In this grant application, I propose to identify the Notch pathway
receptors involved in obesity-driven metabolic disease. The work I propose builds on preliminary
experimental data from mice indicating that Notch2 is responsible for Notch activity in T2D, as
well an unexpected protective role for Notch1, which appears to be mediated by a paradoxical
increase in Notch2 protein followed by Notch1 depletion. I will investigate the impact of
hepatocyte-specific deletion of Notch2 on diet-driven development of hyperglycemia (Aim 1A)
and confirm in vitro whether this occurs in a hepatocyte-autonomous fashion (Aim 1B). I will
study the unexpected homeostatic role of Notch1 on Notch pathway activity in models of T2D
through hepatocyte-specific Notch1 deletion and Notch1-Notch2 double deletion to determine
epistasis between Notch1 and Notch2 (Aim 2A). Finally, I will use immunoprecipitation of
Notch2 followed by targeted western blotting as well as mass spectrometry to dissect the
mechanism by which Notch1 depletion leads to increased Notch2 protein (Aim 2B). Together,
our proposed work will clarify key steps in the transmission and regulation of Notch pathway
signals that drive metabolic dysfunction in obesity."
11029885,"Project Summary/Abstract
Structural studies have established that naturally elicited antibodies can bind to HIV envelope (Env) over a wide
range of epitopes and angles mediated by their Fab arm (i.e. “immune complex geometry”). How this affects
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity, especially by Natural Killer (NK) cells is unknown. Our
knowledge is limited by a poor understanding of how antibody immune complexes orchestrate antibody receptor
based signaling (specifically for Fc gamma RIIIa, FcγRIIIa). The long-term goal is to acquire a more detailed
understanding of how antibodies recruit Fc mediated cellular activity and to develop novel strategies to engineer
antibodies, drugs, and vaccines that can recruit specific effector functions with maximal potency in vivo. The
objective of this proposal is to determine how immune complex geometry impacts NK cell ADCC against HIV
and IgG receptor spatiotemporal dynamics within the NK cell immune synapse (NKIS). Our central hypothesis
is that antibody geometry will modulate FcγRIIIa interaction and ADCC activity in relation to immune complex
geometry. The rationale for this work is that cutting-edge microscopy observations will provide new insight into
ADCC function with immediate impacts on HIV antibody therapeutic design with applications to a broader range
of human diseases. Our central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine how immune
complex geometry influences FcgRIIIa interaction during ADCC; 2) Perform single molecule tracking of FcγRIIIa
within the NKIS during ADCC; 3) Determine nanometer-scale localization of FcγRIIIa and signaling kinases within
the NKIS during ADCC. We will pursue these aims using the innovative technique of MINFLUX nanoscopy,
a super-resolution fluorescence microscopy technique that is capable of 1- to 3-nm spatial resolutions in both
2- and 3-dimensions as well as sub-millisecond tracking of single molecules in live cells. Carefully measured
in vitro ADCC activity and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements will also complement
our MINFLUX observations and broaden the interpretation of our results. These studies are significant because
they will establish a molecular basis for antibody effector function, especially in relation to NK cell ADCC, that
could improve therapeutics for HIV. The techniques established in this proposal will also be useful for
interrogating antibody ADCC function for other viral pathogens. The expected outcome of our studies is the
characterization of biophysical principles that alter NK cell ADCC activity as well as the molecular mechanics
that form the basis for such activity. These findings will have an important impact on human health by offering
a rational basis for designing improved antibody therapeutics for HIV, as well as other viruses and diseases,
and will increase our basic understanding of NK cell ADCC."

PROJECT SUMMARY: Identification and treatment of risk factors that accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD)
are essential to slowing disease progression. Alphaherpesviruses (herpes simplex virus type 1 [HSV-1], varicella
zoster virus [VZV]) are potential accelerators of AD because they increase dementia risk and produce similar
pathologies, including amyloid, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment1-3. In
parallel literature, early AD is characterized by smell loss4,5, amyloid deposition in olfactory epithelium (OE)6,7,
and olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) dysfunction (reviewed in8). Because sniff-induced gamma () oscillations
generated in olfactory bulb (OB) are directionally coupled to the hippocampus9-12, smell loss would result in
decreased hippocampal  oscillations that have been postulated to lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive
decline.14-16 Because alphaherpesviruses infect and reactivate in the nasal cavity, alphaherpesvirus disruption of
olfactory pathways may accelerate AD. Our preliminary data show: (1) compared to controls, OB and olfactory
tract (OT) from familial AD (FAD) subjects have upregulation of viral and inflammatory transcriptional
pathways , confirmed at the protein level; (2) VZV immediate early protein 62 was detected in serum of 2 of 3
AD subjects and in 0/4 controls; (3) HSV-1- and VZV-infected human OE cultures (OECs) contain amyloid and
increased OSN differentiation; and, (4) intranasal HSV-1-infected 5xFAD mice have increased OE amyloid and
decreased olfaction compared to uninfected or pre-inoculation controls, respectively. Taken together, we
hypothesize that alphaherpesvirus infection of the OE contributes to pathological processes within the olfactory
system and hippocampus, thereby accelerating disease. To test this hypothesis, we will: (Aim 1) identify
gene
hippocampus, (Aim 2) determine
whether infection of human OE with VZV and HSV-1 ex vivo elicits amyloid production and
loss of odorant responsiveness, recapitulating smell loss in AD; and (Aim 3) test whether HSV-
1 worsens olfactory dysfunction in 5xFAD mice, accelerating the AD phenotype; specifically, we
will test whether HSV-1-induced pathology and functional changes are diminished by
optogenetic stimulation of mitral/tufted cells in the  frequency range and if entrainment of
hippocampal  oscillations can prevent cellular and behavioral deficits elicited by HSV-
1. Understanding how viruses interact with the aging olfactory system, as well as with individuals who
overexpress amyloidogenic peptides (FAD), to accelerate AD will identify potential biomarkers and therapies
(e.g. vaccines or antiviral agents) that may slow or halt progression to clinical dementia, disability, and death.

11020551,"PROJECT SUMMARY
MSM remain disparately impacted by HIV, with only 35% of US MSM with indications for PrEP having ever
used PrEP. Meth use is an established and persistent driver of HIV incidence for MSM, with up to 33% of
incident HIV infections in MSM attributable to stimulant use. There is increasing interest in delivering HIV
prevention interventions via a mobile health (mHealth) platform, while implementing PrEP, to replicate the
successes of mHealth delivery among meth-using MSM living with HIV. We seek to address this gap by
evaluating the combination of state-of-the-art, multi-modal pharmaco-behavioral interventions for the greatest
improvement in PrEP adherence (i.e., the “CHAMPION”). CHAMPION will combine two mobile health
technologies: (PREPAPP with virtual cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT4CBT]). We aim to (1) Evaluate the
feasibility and acceptability of CHAMPION, compared to a waitlist control, and (2) Evaluate the preliminary
efficacy of CHAMPION on increasing PrEP adherence, compared to a waitlist control. To advance these aims,
we will enroll 100 HIV-negative MSM who use meth in a 6-month randomized-controlled trial of PrEPAPP and
CBT4CBT with a 3-month waitlist control. Eligible participants include those with meth use disorder (MUD).
Enrolled participants will be randomized to either receive the CHAMPION intervention package, or have a 3-
month usual care waitlist control. Behavioral assessments will be administered monthly and objective
measures of PrEP adherence will be examined using dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected every 3
months. Feasibility will be assessed through treatment retention and engagement rates at month 3 and 6
follow-up. Preliminary efficacy will be assessed using DBS endpoints. In exploratory aims, we will examine
preliminary efficacy on meth use and sexual risk behavior. This study will focus on MSM because meth is
highly prevalent in this population and meth has been linked to HIV transmission and acquisition among MSM.
If CHAMPION is efficacious, it may ultimately expand available strategies for MSM to reduce meth use,
increase PrEP adherence, and reduce meth-associated sexual risk behaviors."
11030361,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is widespread throughout the entire African continent and in some endemic
areas over 50% of the population is exposed by adulthood. Antiviral responses induced by interferon (IFN)
signaling can limit RVFV replication and inhibit RVFV pathogenesis in vivo. RVFV is known to infect
mononuclear phagocytic cells (MPCs), hepatocytes, and neurons, consistent with its main clinical
manifestations of acute febrile illness, hepatitis, or encephalitis. However, it is largely unknown how each of
these cell types recognizes and responds to RVFV infection or how cell type specific innate immune responses
modulate viral pathogenesis. The overall objective for this proposal is to determine how the mammalian host
innate immune system recognizes and responds to RVFV infection and how this modulates viral pathogenesis.
Our central hypothesis is that differential innate immune recognition and response by infected cells modulates
viral pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) identify the innate immune sensors and effectors active in
biologically relevant human primary cells, 2) define the contribution of key innate immune sensors and
effectors in recognition and response to RVFV infection in vivo and 3) define the role of hematopoietic cell
infection in RVFV pathogenesis in vivo. The results of this research will define the mechanisms of innate
immune recognition and response following RVFV infection. Moreover, it will inform on cell type-specific
responses to infection and how virally mediated antagonism of those responses contributes to viral
pathogenesis."

This Idaho INBRE Program Administrative Supplement will fund equipment that enhances the
microscopic imaging infrastructure in the Imaging and Data Acquisition Core (IDAC) facility at
the University of Idaho (UI). This equipment will increase the technical capacity, accessibility,
and impact of this IDeA-built core in the Institute for Modeling Collaboration and Innovation
(IMCI). The IMCI is a multidisciplinary, collaborative research program housed at the UI and
supported by a COBRE award. Its microscopy capabilities were initiated by INBRE and are part
of the larger INBRE Data Science Core. The IDAC provides confocal microscopy, flow
cytometry, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting to users at UI, INBRE partner institutions, and
other nearby institutions. In FY22, the IDAC supported the research of 19 UI faculty and 42
trainees, from 5 UI Colleges and 9 Departments. Importantly, 12 NIH-funded or NIH grant-
seeking researchers at the UI critically rely on the equipment and technology offered through
the IDAC for their research programs. INBRE, through awards to faculty PIs (i.e. Developmental
Research Project and Pilot Awards) and support of summer INBRE fellows, directly supports
user fees for IDAC equipment. The requested equipment purchase will upgrade and enhance
the previous and ongoing NIH IDeA investments in Idaho infrastructure, equipment, and
faculty/staff related to confocal, widefield, and live microscopic imaging and image analysis. We
propose to purchase a super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (Deep SIM) add-on
to the current Crest X-Light V3 confocal microscope and an additional, independent
epifluorescence/widefield microscope system, to be housed, maintained, and operated in the
IDAC. Neither of these technologies/imaging platforms are currently available in the IDAC, and
super-resolution microscopy is currently not available on the UI campus. Our current
microscopy options are in high demand, including a > 10-year-old spinning disk confocal. With
the additional proposed equipment purchases, IDAC users will be able to access three distinct
microscope technologies (confocal, Deep SIM, widefield). Finally, this purchase will provide the
first user access to super-resolution microscopy on the UI campus. Collectively, this INBRE
administrative supplement will add important equipment to enhance the capabilities for
biomedical researchers statewide."
11030921,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are trialed as therapies in bone regenerative medicine owing to their ability to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic and myogenic lineages. However, therapeutic outcomes vary greatly. The basis for this inconsistency is unclear but can be attributed to MSC heterogeneity characterized by donor-to-donor variability and intra-donor heterogeneity in phenotypic and functional characteristics. Unfortunately, current strategies to improve MSC potency for bone repair via preconditioning with exogenous growth factors or genetic manipulation have limited potential for FDA approval owing to efficacy and safety concerns. Here, we propose novel noninvasive approaches to improve MSC functionality using biophysical stimulation and senescence clearance in heterogenous cultures. The objective of this project is to determine whether MSC potency for bone repair can be improved by (i) non-invasive, biomechanical signals and (ii) modulating cellular senescence in heterogeneous MSC populations. We propose three aims: (i) determine if non-invasive mechanical signaling promotes osteoblastic differentiation of MSCs and their bone-repair potency. (ii) determine the impact of MSC senescence on bone-repair potency and, (iii) define MSC heterogeneity using single-cell RNA sequencing and correlate key heterogeneity parameters with in vivo outcomes of new bone formation. To execute these aims, MSCs will be delivered low magnitude vibrations (LMV) and assessed for in vitro osteogenic differentiation and in vivo bone formation within critical-sized calvarial defect in mice. Secondly, heterogenous cultures of MSCs characterized by significant presence of senescent cells and associated secretory phenotype will be treated with senolytics followed by assessment for osteogenic differentiation capacity, cytokine and trophic factor secretion, and in vivo bone healing in a calvarial defect model. Thirdly, we will investigate gene expression differences related to key MSC characteristics such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell surface phenotype using single cell genomics approach on multiple donor MSCs. Unraveling stem cell subpopulations that may determine functional potency will be critical for the selection of suitable donors for allogeneic cell therapies. The proposed innovative use of LMV and senolytics as pre-transplantation conditioning to achieve homogeneous and potent MSC preparations holds significance in developing successful cell-based regenerative therapies for cranial tissue repair."
11014736,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1) is a master regulator of cell growth and metabolism in
eukaryotes. Work carried out over the last 20 years has shed light on the mechanisms underlying hormone
and amino acid signaling to TORC1, but it is still unclear how other key signals, such as glucose starvation, are
transmitted to this highly conserved complex. In the last grant period, we examined TORC1 signaling in
budding yeast, and found that the PKC, Gcn2, Sit4, and CK2 signaling pathways work together with the GAP
SEAC (GATOR1/2 in humans) to inhibit TORC1 via the highly-conserved GTPases, Gtr1/2 (Rag A/B and C/D
in humans). This in turn releases TORC1 to move into a single inactive body at the edge of the
vacuole/lysosome—an event that depends on the TORC1 binding protein, Pib2. Building on this framework,
we now wish to: (1) Identify and characterize the proteins and pathways work in parallel with Gtr1/2 to regulate
TORC1, and (2) determine how the conserved Gcn2, PKC, Sit4, CK2 pathways, regulate TORC1 via Gtr1/2.
To address the first question, we purified TORC1 from cells exposed to a variety of stress and starvation
conditions, and identified numerous new interactors. The most notable are the uncharacterized
vacuolar/lysosomal membrane proteins Ydl180w, Ygr125w and Syg1, since they bind tightly to TORC1 and are
required for its movement into, or out of, the inactive bodies. We now propose to study the function of these
TORC1 binding proteins in detail, testing the hypotheses that: (i) Ydl180w is repressor of TORC1 and
competes with Gtr1/2 to control TORC1 activity, (ii) Ygr125w is a sulfur dependent activator of TORC1, and (iii)
Syg1 is a phosphate dependent activator of TORC1. To address the second question, we purified the major
Gtr1/2 regulator SEAC, and mapped its phosphorylation in glucose and nitrogen starvation conditions. This led
to the identification of over 150 phosphorylation sites, many of which are hyper- or hypo-phosphorylated during
glucose and/or nitrogen starvation. Building on these data, we now wish to test the hypothesis that the
conserved Gcn2, PKC, Sit4, CK2, and other kinases/phosphatases inhibit TORC1 by (de)phosphorylating and
activating SEAC. We also plan to explore a new connection we identified between the key serine synthesis
enzymes Ser3/33 (PHGDH in humans) and the TORC1 regulator Pib2—testing the hypothesis that Ser3/33
activate TORC1 via Pib2 in the presence, but not absence, of serine. Our proposal is innovative in that we
study new and unexplored aspects of TORC1 signaling using state-of-the-art systems, proteomic, and
biochemical approaches. The proposed research is significant in that it promises to shed light on the
mechanisms underlying cell growth control, and complex signal integration, in an important model organism—
with implications for (a) understanding TORC1 related diseases such as cancer, epilepsy, diabetes and
obesity, since many of the proteins and pathways under investigation are conserved and (b) developing drugs
that selectively block the growth of pathogenic fungi."

 Surgery is on the verge of a paradigm shift towards autonomous robot-assisted surgeries (RAS).
Increasingly, RAS is incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to automate parts of surgery, allowing
computer algorithms to make critical decisions during surgery and directly affecting patient care. Autonomous
RAS raises new ethical concerns relating to changes to surgeons’ professional autonomy, informed consent,
confidentiality/privacy, and the surgeon-patient relationship. The use of autonomous RAS transforms surgeons’
professional autonomy in the operating room by introducing an independent entity in surgical decision-making.
The surgeon’s role shifts from being the principal decision-maker to collaborating with the robot or providing
oversight of the robot’s actions. Informed consent to autonomous RAS requires new ethical deliberations and
information disclosures given that the robot may be making critical decisions during surgery. New ethical
issues, including protecting the privacy of RAS-collected patient data, will need to be added in informed
consent discussions for autonomous RAS to ensure the surgeon-patient relationship remains human-centered.
 Although no RAS is fully autonomous today, surgical robots are being endowed with increasing levels of
autonomy. Ethical guardrails and guidelines on how to inform patients about autonomous RAS must be in
place before autonomous RAS should be disseminated for widespread use. While the few available studies
found that patients may be “apprehensive” about undergoing autonomous RAS, little is known about the
factors shaping patients’ decision-making. A survey study of 11,004 American adults found that 59% would not
want AI-powered robots to be used in their own surgery. Further, no empirical studies have investigated
patients’ information needs to facilitate informed consent for the adoption of this innovative surgical technique.
 The objective of this study is to examine ethical issues in autonomous RAS. We will examine
surgeons’ and patients’ perceptions of ethical issues involved in performing and undergoing autonomous RAS,
and factors affecting patients’ decisions about undergoing autonomous RAS. We will develop educational
materials to facilitate surgeon-patient communication about autonomous RAS and the management of
surgeon-patient relationships throughout pre-, intra-, and post-robotic care. The specific aims are to:
 1) Assess surgeons’, proceduralists’, and nurses’ perceptions of ethical issues in autonomous RAS
 2) Assess surgical patients’ decision-making for undergoing autonomous RAS
 3) Develop educational materials to foster patients’ informed decisions about autonomous RAS
The impact of the proposed study will be a better understanding of ethical issues of autonomous RAS to
facilitate surgeon-patient communication and ensure that the surgeon-patient relationship remains human-
centered. Our results will facilitate the adoption of innovative surgical techniques through autonomous RAS."

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes lymphomas at greatly increased frequency in people living with HIV/AIDS,
including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, primary CNS lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, and
post-transplant lymphomas. Consequently, most AIDS-related lymphomas are EBV-infected. Yet, EBV
transformation sensitizes infected B-cells to attack by natural killer (NK) cells, which exert key roles in control
of EBV-driven B-cell malignancies in immunocompetent hosts. Much remains unknown about how NK
recognize latently EBV-infected B lymphoblastoid cells and how EBV+ B cells evolve resistance to NK control.
To gain insights, we performed the first human genome-wide CRISPR screen of EBV-transformed B-cell
escape from NK surveillance using a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL), a key model for EBV-driven immunoblastic
lymphomas including the AIDS defining cancer primary CNS lymphoma. Our screen identified factors known to
be important for EBV+ B-cell recognition by NK, including CD48, which is highly EBV-induced. Unexpectedly,
multiple CRISPR screen hits centered on the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) complex, an epigenetic repressor
that induces heterochromatin formation to silence target gene expression. HUSH is implicated in silencing of HIV
genes, but has not been studied in the contexts of EBV infection, B-cell immunobiology or NK surveillance.
Protocadherin gamma (PCDHG) family members, which are adhesion molecules typically expressed only by
neurons, were highly enriched amongst LCL genes de-repressed by HUSH KO. Furthermore, PCDHG are
necessary for NK resistance driven by HUSH KO and sufficient for inhibition of LCL lysis by NK. We therefore
hypothesize that PCDHG expression represents a ‘don’t kill me’ signal to protect neurons from NK attack, but
which is subverted to support EBV+ lymphomagenesis. Our central hypothesis is that NK surveillance of EBV
transformed B-cells requires B-cell intrinsic HUSH complex activity, in the absence of which gamma-
protocadherin are de-repressed and interact with a novel NK inhibitory receptor to prevent NK lysis. Our
specific aims are: (1) Characterize key proto-cadherin gamma properties in EBV transformed B-cell evasion of
NK attack, including in tumor samples from HIV+ individuals. (2) Identify the Proto-cadherin Gamma NK
Counter-Receptor and Characterize its NK Inhibitory Roles. Collectively, these studies promise to identify a
novel NK cell inhibitory pathway subverted by EBV+ tumors. Our studies may lay the foundation for novel
therapeutic approaches that could re-sensitize tumors that subvert this pathway to NK attack."

The overall goal of my research project is to understand how the dynamic behavior of human G protein-coupled
receptors (GPCRs) drives the assembly of GPCR complexes with drugs and partner signaling proteins at a
single-molecule level. GPCRs are sensory membrane proteins that recognize a wide array of hormones, drugs,
and neurotransmitters, representing the largest class of proteins targeted by FDA-approved therapeutics. The
energy landscape of GPCRs is complex and populated by multiple conformers with distinct functions and
structures. While the structures of some GPCR conformers have been characterized by x-ray crystallography
and cryo-EM, the lifetimes of these different conformations and their rates of exchange are mostly unknown. We
aim to map the energy landscape of GPCR complexes using single-molecule fluorescence (SMF), which enables
the investigation of GPCR dynamics in real-time and in environments that recapitulate the cellular milieu. In the
long term, we aim to apply this information to improve our understanding of how disease-associated mutations
alter these energy landscapes, which may ultimately guide the design of new therapeutics. This proposal aims
to apply SMF to map the energy landscapes of two human GPCRs. First, we will investigate the conformational
dynamics of a representative class A human GPCR, the A2A adenosine receptor (A2AAR). A2AAR provides an
important benchmark for single-molecule fluorescence studies and will enable us to compare our experimental
measurements of dynamics to computational predictions. Our studies will reveal both similarities and differences
in mechanisms of signaling between different class A GPCRs and will also show for the first time how lipids in
the bilayer membrane can act as allosteric modulators of GPCR function. In the second direction, we will use
SMF to study the conformational dynamics of the human glucagon receptor (GCGR). GCGR is a hormone-
binding class B GPCR that is activated by one of the central metabolites, glucagon. GCGR is critical to glucose
homeostasis and is a validated drug target for type 2 diabetes therapy. Crystal and cryo-EM structures of GCGR
have shown that the large extracellular domains appear to act in concert with the transmembrane domain to bind
hormones and small molecules, but the dynamics of ligand binding are as yet not understood. Our studies of
GCGR will reveal in real-time the mechanisms of ligand recognition by the extracellular domain and quantify
function-related dynamic fluctuations of the transmembrane domains. These studies will allow us to compare
the dynamics of complex formation with hormones and with small molecules to understand the role of the
extracellular domain in ligand recognition. This will help us understand how ligands with different chemical
structures and pharmacological efficacies affect the receptor activation pathways and will ultimately aid in the
design and screening of GPCR-targeted drugs with tailored pharmacological responses."

We propose to develop a novel therapeutic for respiratory viruses, including all current and predicted SARS-
CoV-2 variants, other coronaviruses, influenza, and paramyxo/pneumoviruses—using a peptidomimetic small
molecule approach targeting TMPRSS2 and other trypsin-like proteases (TTSP) that are essential for virus entry.
We expect our therapeutic platform to be applicable and effective for prophylactic use, and so we will target virus
transmission studies in vivo. As our system is based on simple-to-synthesize peptides, which act outside of the
cell, is it expected to be cost–effective, and our approach is specifically designed to cover a range of distinct
viruses. However, it is important to note that our platform is highly flexible, and be applicable in the face of a
novel viruses that may emerge, without significance anti-viral resistance (as it is host-targeted)."
11028295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nup358 is a major component of the nuclear pore complex, and forms the long filaments that extend from the
nuclear pore rim into the cytoplasm. Nup358 comprises four RAN-binding domains (RBD1-4) separated by
several unique domains. HIV-1 capsid (CA) binds Nup358 via its C-terminal cyclophilin-homology domain
(CHD). Our comparative analysis of diverse primate lentiviruses and cognate Nup358 homologs from reservoir
and spillover hosts revealed a previously unknown effect of the fourth RAN-binding domain (RBD4) on
specificity of CA interactions with the CHD. However, this effect is consistent with an earlier literature reporting
an effect of the RBD4 on interactions with cellular substrates. Preliminary results show that RBD4-dependent
interactions with the CHD affect nuclear import and infectivity. The most striking example involves HIV-2, which
had to adapt to differences between the sooty mangabey reservoir host and human Nup358 during emergence
in humans. Relevance of the CA-CHD interaction was further underscored by the discovery that it is more
conserved among primate lentiviruses than previously reported. The exceptions were viruses of the SIVmac
lineage: these lost the CA-CHD interaction during adaptation to macaque hosts, most likely as an evolutionary
trade-off that allowed these viruses to evade restriction by macaque TRIM5a and TRIMCyp. The lack of this
otherwise conserved interaction with Nup358 may be a critical difference between HIV-1 infection in humans
and the SIVmac/SHIV animal models widely used in preclinical HIV/AIDS research.
 We will use a comparative approach to explore the molecular level details of the conserved interactions
between various lentivirus capsids and the RBD4-CHD didomain of the relevant Nup358 homologs, and to
determine the basis for the RBD4-dependent effects on CA-CHD binding specificity. The major innovation of
this proposal is to leverage naturally occurring variations in 1) lentiviruses CAs and 2) primate Nup358
homologs, which allows us to precisely manipulate virus-host interactions in cell culture, while avoiding the
pleiotropic complications associated with the more drastic approaches used to date (e.g. deletions in Nup358
and whole gene knockdowns or knockouts). Our goal is to produce a working model of the interactions
between lentiviruses and Nup358, including both conserved and virus-specific elements, and to understand
how these interactions contribute to nuclear docking, nuclear transport, integration site selection, and evasion
of innate immune responses. This will also help us to understand how the RBD4 determines specificity of
CHD-CA interactions. Finally, our results may expose potential differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections
in humans and experimental infection of macaques with SIVmac and SHIVs."
11029945,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are capable of regenerating the entire hematopoietic system. This capacity is
fully unleashed upon bone marrow transplantation, however, recent studies including ours indicate that HSCs
have a much more limited contribution to hematopoiesis during homeostasis. While stress from sources like
chemotherapies or inflammation increases the contribution from HSCs to multiple hematopoietic lineages, little
is known about how HSCs respond to stressors that cause anemia. Identifying the progenitor cell population and
signals that promote erythroid regeneration may lead to novel strategies to better harness HSCs for the treatment
of anemia and regenerative medicine overall. Using a HSC lineage tracing model, we found that hemolytic
anemia specifically enhances erythroid contribution by HSCs, indicating that HSCs respond to erythroid stress
by initiating erythropoiesis. After hemolytic anemia, HSCs expressed more erythropoiesis-related genes and
exhibited enhanced erythroid differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, HSCs had increased iron content
after hemolytic anemia and iron chelation prevented erythroid-biased differentiation. Iron is a cofactor for the
iron(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase TET2 that demethylates DNA, and erythropoiesis is associated
with DNA demethylation. We found that TET2 protein, but not mRNA, is increased in HSCs during anemia and
deletion of Tet2 suppressed the enhanced erythroid differentiation of HSCs we observed following hemolytic
anemia. We thus hypothesized that HSCs respond to anemia by increasing iron uptake, TET2 expression, and
DNA demethylation, thereby increasing the expression of erythropoiesis genes. In Aim 1, we will study the
heterogeneity of splenic HSCs during anemia and identify the erythroid-biased fraction of HSCs. In Aim 2, we
will examine the role of TET2 in promoting erythroid commitment of splenic HSC. In Aim 3, we will investigate
the mechanism by which TET2 protein is stabilized in HSCs during anemia. Completion of this study will provide
novel insights into the differences between bone marrow and splenic HSCs in responding to anemia, and the
mechanism by which iron and TET2 instructs HSCs to become committed to the erythroid lineage."

Climate change, agriculture practices, hydrology alterations, and sewage sheds are contributing to an increase
in the frequency and intensity of cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms (cHABs) that produce bioactive and toxic
secondary peptide metabolites. As a result, public health and drinking water advisories, recreational water
closures, and coastal seafood contamination have increased. Cyanobacteria peptide toxins are known causes
or suspect in liver, neurological, dermal, gastrointestinal and kidney disease. Although hundreds of potential
toxic and beneficial bioactive peptides have been reported, only a handful of reference materials are
commercially available. cHAB peptide research, monitoring, and mitigation has been bottlenecked by lack of
certified and bulk reference materials. Analytically pure (certified) synthetic standards cyanotoxin and
reliable analytical workflows are critically needed to protect public health. Our long-term goal is to create
a stable and reliable supply of CHAB cyanopeptide reference materials to enable investigation of cyanopeptides’
occurrence and human health impacts. Our objectives in this proposal are to establish efficient synthetic routes
and bioactivity profiles for anabaenopeptins (ABPs) and microcystins (MCs), to create mass spectrometry
workflows for their identification and quantification, and to establish the impact of ingestion and inhalation
pathways as exposure routes. In particular, we will assess cyanotoxins’ impact on cells from the respiratory tract
and on reconstituted human fecal samples. The ABPs and MCs are observed in the Great Lakes region’s
freshwater bodies in high concentrations and are known to have hundred(s) of congeners with varying degrees
of toxicity and bioactivity. Many of these lakes/rivers contain congeners with tentative or unassigned
identifications. Our congener selection is designed to increase the reliability and reproducibility of targeted and
untargeted mass spectrometry workflows. Cyanotoxin exposure routes and their health impacts are dependent
on the interplay of chemical structure and the environment. The proposed aerosol studies will assist in validating
inhalation as an exposure route. There is a critical need for cyanopeptides/congeners to be synthesized,
characterized, and then systematically studied to quantify their associated exposure risks in cHAB waters,
cHAB-exposed food sources, and aerosols. Our proposed work combines the expertise of several areas of
chemistry and pharmacology and is important because it empowers ongoing fundamental cHAB research in the
areas of ecology, toxicology, biology, and fate and transport, and provides reliable cyanotoxin quantification
through certified standards for water resource managers and public health decision makers."

 One million Americans live with Ulcerative Colitis (UC), and 30% of that population is over 60. Thirty-eight
thousand new cases are diagnosed yearly, with 15% over 65. More than a quarter of UC patients are aged,
and prevalence in the over 65 is increasing at an annual rate of 2.8%. Surgery treatment is risky in geriatric
patients, and better therapy is needed. UC is an immune-mediated disorder of the colon that is debilitating and
not medically curable. Extensive studies have shown a pathogenesis due to aberrant immune responses to the
intestinal microbiota, resulting in acute and chronic inflammations characterized by infiltrates of activated
macrophages (MΦ), neutrophils (Ns), and lymphocytes, indicating a deregulated activation of the intestine-
innate immunity responder cells (MΦ and Ns). In UC, correlating with this deregulation is the unusual
expression of the Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) on the intestinal MΦ and the
presence of activated platelets expressing a ligand for TREM1. TREM1 is a potent activation receptor of MΦ
and Ns, and its excess triggering leads to the overproduction of inflammatory mediators and excess
inflammation. Two-thirds of patients obtain only partial or no benefit from current therapies, specifically those
with MΦ high-TREM1 expression sustained inflammation. Over 1400 scientific articles document the role of the
TREM1-activation pathway (TAP) in inflammation. We have identified TREM1-sv, a natural splice variant and
competitive inhibitor of TREM1, which can downregulate TAP. TREM1-sv was very efficient at downregulating
excess inflammation in preclinical sepsis trials, a disease driven by a deregulated TAP. In UC, deregulation of
TAP might occur from depletion of TREM1-sv, ensuing persistent activation of myeloid cells from activated
platelets. We anticipate that administering TREM1-sv intravenously or subcutaneously will stop the excess
inflammation. The rationale is that TREM1-sv downregulates TAP by competing for the TREM1 ligands,
thereby reducing the number of TREM1-ligand complexes and avoiding an excess triggering activation of MΦ
and Ns. Hence, the intestine can recover a healthy immunity and heal. We aim to show therapeutic efficacy by
conducting experiments in which different regimens of TREM1-sv are administered to well-established mouse
models of chronic ulcerative colitis with altered innate immunity. We use a custom-made strain of P. pastoris to
produce a batch of purified biologically active human recombinant (hu r) TREM1-sv for animal treatments. After
induction of UC, inflammation will be assessed before and after hu rTREM1-sv treatment with an established
four-parameter UC scoring system and correlated with measurements in the blood of the inflammatory cytokine
levels and TREM1-sv concentration. Neutralization experiments with an anti-TREM1-sv antibody and
comparative anti-TNF therapy will be conducted. We aim to produce innovative data demonstrating the benefit
of hu rTREM1-sv to downregulate hyperactive intestinal inflammation in UC. Downregulating TAP with hu
rTREM1-sv is an innovative scientific approach to alleviate excess inflammation in UC patients."

This proposed project is aimed at developing a method for capturing and concentrating exhaled breath aerosols
by electrostatically charging them and collecting them on sub-mm diameter areas for optimal trace aerosol
detection sensitivity by infrared tunable laser spectroscopy (TLS). An immediate application for this technology
is detection of trace amounts of the marijuana intoxicating aerosol ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but
other applications include detection of dangerous drugs and viruses. Prior work on spectroscopic sensing of
THC at Vox Biomedical indicated that exhaled breath aerosol area concentration is needed because the sub-ng
amounts of THC in exhaled breath aerosols are so small that the captured aerosols do not entirely cover the
1 cm2 sample areas typically used in infrared spectroscopy, thereby reducing system sensitivity. Modeling
showed that aerosol concentration onto sub-mm diameter areas of diameter equal to the diffraction-limited
focused TLS quantum cascade laser spot size enables optimal detection sensitivity, resulting in several orders
of magnitude improved spectroscopic detection sensitivity because a much larger fraction of the focused probe
laser light will be absorbed by the concentrated analyte. The required sub-mm diameter area THC aerosol
analyte concentration will be achieved by electrostatically charging the exhaled breath THC aerosols and then
accelerating the charged aerosols onto an electrically conducting silicon coupon covered with a non-conducting
oxide layer into which a 0.1 mm diameter opening is photolithographically defined. This photolithographic wafer
fabrication process will be carried out in a local semiconductor foundry. The design of the patterned silicon wafer
will be such that the wafer can be sectioned into identical small coupons, each with a single 0.1 mm diameter
oxide opening, that will then be used in the planned analyte deposition experiments.
To demonstrate the efficacy of this proposed new aerosol concentration method during Phase I Vox Biomedical
will first use a well-characterized Alphazurine-A dye obtained from a nebulizer and precision injected into a
polycarbonate cylinder and charged by an electric field of several kV/cm as created by a cylindrically symmetric
arrangement of three tungsten tip corona needles. Since the Alphazurine-A dye is well characterized by its known
spectral absorption characteristics, it will be possible to determine the minimum detectible amounts of deposited
dye aerosols. Following the Phase I Alphazurine-A dye concentration study, a more refined feasibility
demonstration will be carried out using THC aerosols that will be generated by nebulizing methanol with
quantitatively known THC concentrations obtained from commercial THC-in-methanol solutions. Phase II will
then include human marijuana user exhaled breath measurements. Successful development of the proposed
new electrostatic aerosol concentration method will provide both law enforcement and employee screening
personnel with a non-invasive means for identifying marijuana and drug users in real time. If successful, this
aerosol capture technique could also be applied to identifying exhaled breath virus content."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and currently there is no effective treatment.
The amyloid cascade of increased production of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides from amyloid precursor protein (APP)
and extracellular deposition in Aβ plaques plays a key role in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Many
disease-modifying therapies have been developed to reduce Aβ production using APP secretase inhibitors and
remove extracellular Aβ from brains by Aβ-targeted monoclonal antibodies. While hundreds of clinical trials of
these drugs have failed, recently new Aβ-targeted monoclonal antibodies such as donanemab were reported to
reduce Aβ in brain and slow cognitive decline in a fraction of AD patients, a vindication for amyloid cascade as
a therapeutic target in AD. In this project, we propose to develop the small-molecule degraders of APP as novel
amyloid cascade modifying therapeutics. Targeted protein degradation is revolutionizing drug discovery from
small-molecule inhibitors to degraders that recruit disease-causing proteins to the proteasomal and lysosome
for destruction. Recently we have discovered the compounds as the first APP degraders that degrade APP and
thereby reduces Aβ production using the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) collected from AD patients. APP
degrader compounds directly bind at the interface of APP and cytoplasmic activation/ proliferation-associate
protein 1 (CAPRIN1) and induce CAPRIN1-mediated APP degradation in the lysosome, resulting in the reduction
of neuronal production and extracellular accumulation of Aβ amyloids in AD iPSC neurons and organoids. In this
STTR phase I project, we propose to optimize APP degrader compounds with the objective of identifying more
lead compounds with improved potency, solubility, and permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB). To achieve this
objective, we propose a hit-to-lead optimization with the focus on chemical modifications of our lead compounds
by our state-of-the art computational chemistry approaches in Aim 1. Each compound will be designed based
on computer-predicted drug-like properties and BBB permeability and advanced through our compound testing
funnel of step-by-step assays of the activity and drug-like properties. The activity in reduction of APP and Aβ will
be confirmed in our panel of AD patients’ iPSCs. The top-ranked potent compounds will be selected from the
studies of Aim 1 and subjected to pharmacokinetic and therapeutic evaluation in AD mouse models to determine
whether the compound treatment improves mouse learning task and reduces APP and Aβ levels and Aβ plaques
in AD mouse brains. Upon completion of this one-year project, we expect to provide a proof-of-concept that the
small molecule degraders of APP can be used to treat AD mouse models through the degradation of APP and
reduction of Aβ42 in AD brains. Therefore, this STTR phase I grant will support us to move the project from the
hit-to-lead to lead optimization stage for identification of the most potent, bioavailable and BBB permeable lead
compounds for clinical development as the first-in-class drugs for treatment of patients suffering of AD."

This project centers on addressing the challenges posed by MPS IV A, a rare lysosomal storage disease
caused by a deficiency in the GALNS enzyme due to mutations in the GALNS gene. Existing treatments, such
as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), fall
short in effectively managing the severe skeletal manifestations of this condition. To overcome these
limitations, the study aims to create a large animal model of MPS IV A and investigate the potential of gene
therapy as a more effective treatment approach.
The research comprises three key goals across two aims:
 1. Generating a Porcine Model of MPS IV A: Using previously generated GALNS knockout lines, a porcine
 model with GALNS deficiency will be made. The animals will be characterized for enzyme deficiency,
 accumulation of keratan sulfate, skeletal defects, and cardiac anomalies. This model will serve as a
 valuable tool for understanding the disease's biology and developing genetic therapies.
 2. Comparative Analysis of AAV and Lentiviral Gene Therapy: The research aims to assess the
 effectiveness of two gene transfer methods, adeno-associated virus (AAV) and lentiviral vectors, in
 treating MPS IV A in mouse models. This comparative study will provide insights into the potential of
 both approaches in preventing metabolic and skeletal diseases associated with MPS IV A.
 3. Advancing Genetic Therapies for MPS IV A: The project explores the novel approach of using
 autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the human
 GALNS sequence to treat MPS IV A. This method offers the potential for high systemic levels of
 GALNS and may bypass the risks associated with allogeneic HSCT.
The outcomes of this research are expected to contribute significantly to understanding MPS IV A and
developing more effective therapies. The creation of a large animal model will enable researchers to closely
mimic human disease conditions, and the comparative analysis of gene therapy methods will inform future
treatment strategies. Overall, this work holds promise for improving the lives of individuals affected by MPS IV
A by advancing the development of gene therapeutics."

The proposed training program aims to address the lack of specialized training in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML) methods for addiction research in Mississippi’s major universities. The program is
featured by its evidence-based multimodalities and extensive interdisciplinary collaboration across three
campuses (University of Mississippi at Oxford, University of Mississippi Medical Center at Jackson, and the
historically black university Jackson State University). The program emphasizes fostering a diverse data
science workforce by collaborating with Jackson State University and making concerted recruitment efforts to
engage underrepresented students at other participating campuses. The program encompasses five integrated
components that create a progressive learning pathway while ensuring sustainability, including webinars (W),
summer academies (A), symposiums (S), a research lab (R), and an e-learning platform (E) branded as
WAS_RE. The novel creation of a progressive learning pathway facilitates underrepresented students' access
to studying AI/ML for addiction research and their engagement throughout the learning process. The WAS_RE
program begins with a series of webinars to raise campus-wide awareness and interest in applying AI/ML for
addiction research. It then progresses to the recruitment of dedicated undergraduate and graduate students (n
= 20 annually) and provides them with expert-led hands-on training during a four-week summer academy,
including a symposium day at the end to further enrich the learning experience. The program will then further
establish a dedicated research lab as a central hub for collaborative mentoring, providing mentored research
experiences to motivated undergraduate and graduate students (n = 6 annually) who have participated in the
summer academy or have equivalent capacities in applying AI/ML for addiction research. Furthermore, the
program will create an e-learning platform to expand the program’s reach by distributing webinar recordings
and to ensure sustainability through offering a self-paced course adapted from the summer academy
curriculum. The successful implementation of this training program is expected to produce a well-trained,
diverse workforce proficient in data science methods for addiction research, inspire students to pursue
advanced degrees in this field, foster enduring collaborations across disciplines and institutions, and advance
the field’s ability to tackle intricate addiction challenges."
11022696,"ABSTRACT
Pannexins comprise a unique family of heptameric large-pore channels that are emerging as novel targets for
treating common, yet hard to cure diseases such as hypertension and chronic pain. Previous studies indicate
that Panx1 is activated through stimulation of structurally unrelated receptors such as G proteincoupled
receptors, ligand-gated ion channels, and tumor necrosis factor receptors. However, it remains unclear what
cellular mechanism(s) actually open and close the Panx1 channel downstream of such seemingly unrelated
stimuli. Furthermore, Panx2 and 3 are severely understudied and essentially nothing is known about the
activation mechanisms of these subtypes. The long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying
pannexin gating, regulation, and physiological signaling pathways. The specific objectives for this proposal are
to identify the physiological pannexin activators and elucidate the subtype-specific activation mechanisms. The
central hypothesis is that both Panx1 and 2 are directly activated by naturally occurring signaling molecules in
living cells and that Panx1 specifically requires posttranslational modifications to be ""primed"" for its activation.
The rationale for the proposed research is that once the direct activation-stimuli and the subtypespecific
mechanisms are identified, it will enable us to fill the critical gap in the pannexin-dependent signaling pathway
by connecting the upstream cell-stimulation and the downstream ATP-permeable membrane pore formation. To
attain the overall objectives, the following three specific aims will be performed:1) Identify the direct pannexin
activators for living cells; 2) Elucidate the role of the N-terminal domain (NTD) in pannexin activation; and 3)
Uncover the subtype-specific structural features of pannexins. These research aims will be executed by using a
combination of a cell-based pannexin activity assay, electrophysiology, functional reconstitution, and cryo-EM.
The research proposed in this application is innovative because it introduces a novel concept that pannexins—
including the understudied Panx2—are directly activated by signaling molecules produced downstream of
various stimuli in living cells. It is also innovative because it will provide important insights into the structure of
the open channel and why Panx2 and 3 behave differently from Panx1. The proposed research is significant
because it will provide concrete molecular mechanisms for the missing link in the pannexin signaling function.
The proposed research is also expected to provide a strong structural foundation for subtype specific
mechanisms of pannexin channels. These results are expected to have profound positive impact not only
because they provide detailed basic mechanisms, but also because they will open a new door for
screening/designing pannexin-specific inhibitors—much-needed molecular tools that have great potentials to
serve as novel therapeutics for a variety of currently uncurable diseases."

Among the half a million childhood cancer survivors alive in the US today, the most commonly reported non-
cancer severe, life-threatening, or fatal chronic condition is cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is the leading non-
cancer cause of premature death in this population. Heart radiation and anthracycline exposure have been
associated with a variety of CVD outcomes including cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and
heart valve disease. Investigations of radiation therapy (RT)-related CVD have typically established
associations based solely on whole heart dose metrics; thus, overlooking the heterogeneity of the organ and its
substructures. Our team was the first to report data demonstrating substructure-level dose response of CVD
risk in childhood cancer survivors. Despite establishing distinct radiosentivities, cardiac substructure dose
constraints are not commonly incorporated into RT treatment planning due to the lack of validated risk
prediction models, thus, missing opportunities to prospectively optimize RT planning and retrospectively
personalize risk-counseling and long-term cardiovascular surveillance in current and future cancer survivors.
The goal of the proposed project is to develop and validate novel CVD risk prediction models that incorporate
cardiac substructure doses. Further, we propose to develop tools to clinically translate these models into
effective personalized treatment paradigms with prospective and retrospective applications for care providers
to reduce CVD risk. We will: (1) develop and validate risk prediction models for cardiomyopathy, CAD, and
heart valve disease incorporating cardiac RT substructure doses, adjusting for demographics and
chemotherapy exposures; and (2) integrate CVD risk prediction models into commercial RT treatment planning
systems and web-based applications, and establish their use via in-silico studies of contemporary patients
treated with RT.
This will be the first investigation to use the unique radiosensitivity of different cardiac substructures as the
foundation for models that can predict the risk of specific types of CVD in children newly diagnosed with cancer
as well as among long-term survivors. Incorporating the substructure doses into prediction models will
significantly advance clinical care for both prospective RT treatment planning and retrospective risk
assessments. Prospectively, late CVD risk could be decreased in future survivors by optimizing delivery of
chest-directed RT with cardiac substructure dose constraints and selecting the plan that confers the lowest
risk, while maintaining optimal clinical target volume coverage. Retrospectively post treatment, the clinical team
can provide evidence-based personalized risk mitigation counseling, based on individualized risk profiles
determined from delivered cardiac substructure doses adjusted for chemotherapy exposures and
demographics. Successful execution of the proposed project has the potential to transform clinical practice for
treatment of childhood and adolescent patients with cancer."

This is an application for a Research Supplement to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research to support
the graduate training of an outstanding Ph.D. student, Diego Ruiz, who meets multiple NIH criteria for an
underrepresented minority. Diego has shown extensive commitment to a career in the biomedical sciences
and has previous undergraduate research prior to starting his graduate studies at the University of New
Mexico. His long-term career goal is to conduct environmental research while devoting substantial effort to
encouraging others of underrepresented groups to consider careers in science. Doctoral training is the logical
next step to achieving his career goal. Diego and I established a mentoring team to help guide his individual
scientific development and position his for short-term success as a Ph.D. student that is competitive for NIH
F31 award. A key part of Diego’s career development plan is successful completion of a research project that
will result in two first-author publications and a submission of a F31 award. Diego’s research project is an
outgrowth of my R01 (R01ES032037; funded through 2027). The purpose of the R01 seeks to bridge the gap
in environmental health knowledge and provide insight into how MP pose a significant health risk to the general
population as well as susceptible individuals. We have found the in vivo exposure of mice to MP results in
intestinal cell lineage changes (as determined by gene expression) and can cross the intestinal barrier and
transverse to other tissues in the body; however, there appears no signs of intestinal inflammation. These two
findings suggest i) MP may influence intestinal stem cell differentiation, specifically, increasing enteroendocrine
cells and ii) the epithelial barrier is sterilizing the MP before reaching the lamina propria. Addressing these
findings is the overall goal of Diego’s project. His first aim involves performing single cell RNA sequencing and
performing bioinformatics. Aim two will be examining the lysosomal response from a molecular and
biochemical approach. Both aims require the use of intestinal organoids and co-mentor Dr. Julie In, an expert
in organoid biology, will provide training in this area. These studies will yield important understanding on how
microplastics can impact gut health. At the conclusion of his research-training period, Diego will be a well-
trained cell biologist with extensive experience in designing and conducting research and in science
communication."

The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School (UMass Chan) seeks NIH C06 funding to renovate
existing space in the medical school (S) building to construct an in vitro Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory for
viral pathogens. As an internationally recognized leader in infectious disease research, UMass Chan has made
pivotal contributions to this field, with a strong focus on hazardous pathogens, including both viral and bacterial
pathogens. During the COVID-19 pandemic, UMass Chan quickly became one of the leading institutes for
research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Our researchers obtained
numerous awards from the NIH, other governmental agencies, and private foundations for these studies. Since
then, our researchers have also obtained funding for collaborative research programs to study other BSL-3-level
viruses of pandemic potential, such as viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) and alphaviruses.
C06 funding is critical to continue these important studies. Our BSL-3 Core Laboratories have been strained by
the increased usage due to the pandemic and the addition of other BSL-3 viral pathogens, such as VHF. To
accommodate this increase, we have used the satellite BSL-3 lab in the Biotech Two building, which will be lost
when UMass Chan repurposes this building in 2026. The remaining S7 BSL-3 lab is already operating at capacity
for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Yersinia pestis studies and cannot adequately accommodate the
researchers studying Risk Group 3 viruses. To proactively address this issue, we seek NIH C06 funding to
convert existing space on the 7th floor of the S-building into a second in vitro BSL-3 lab dedicated to research on
viral pathogens. The proposed new facility addresses increasing demands on our BSL-3 resources by UMass
Chan faculty and other regional investigators. There is strong institutional support for this project and a
commitment to fully equip the new lab, including the purchase of advanced imaging equipment currently
unavailable in BSL-3. The proposed facility will enhance the safety and resilience of the BSL-3 research core,
and maintain the productivity of funded and future research on Risk Group 3 viruses.
Our medical school is uniquely positioned to bridge clinical and basic research studies. As a leading site for
clinical trials, our researchers have access to patient samples to enhance in vitro and in vivo studies. Our findings
can be translated to develop novel prevention and therapeutic strategies leveraging our world-renowned RNA
Therapeutics Institute and Institute for Drug Resistance, as well as our partnership with MassBiologics for
vaccine and biologic therapy development, making UMass Chan a powerhouse for bench-to-bedside
translational research. Robust BSL-3 labs are needed to maintain this excellence and address current and
emerging pathogens with pandemic potential."

11008720,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The success of mRNA-based vaccines and their modular technology have propelled RNA-
based medicines from a relatively niche technology into the mainstream. As RNA-based
medicines research intensifies, the manufacturing capacity of RNA is strained. This issue is
exacerbated by the unprecedented advancement of RNA-based therapeutics into clinical
phases. The increased demand for mRNA-based medicines requires a scalable and cost-
effective manufacturing process with good yield and consistent quality. Currently, mRNA
manufacturing is dominated by enzymatic in vitro transcription (IVT). Although the IVT process
has various advantages, its cost and scalability are constrained by the need for multiple
expensive enzymes and chemical reagents.
Moreover, the lack of a standard process poses another challenge for IVT. A standardized
process for IVT is crucial as changes in concentrations of ribonucleoside triphosphate and
magnesium ions can dramatically affect RNA polymerase specificity, fidelity, and productivity.
Manufacturing RNA in vivo has proven more cost-effective and scalable than other methods.
However, intracellular RNA production has only been successful for double-strand circular
RNA or short molecules that can fit into specific stable RNA scaffolds, falling short for long
single-strand mRNA. Quick RNA degradation by intracellular RNases and the heterogeneity
of RNA transcripts within host cells hinder mRNA production in vivo and consequent
purification processes, respectively. Combinatorial approaches, including host cell
engineering, target RNA design, and a compatible downstream purification process, are
proposed to overcome these challenges. This application aims to develop an all-in-one
platform for intracellular overproduction of long, single-strand mRNA."

In Kenya, HIV incidence among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) ages 15-24 years is 1-2 per 100
person-years and approximately 30% of AGYW have had at least one sexually transmitted infection (STI).
Kisumu, Homa Bay, and Migori counties in Western Kenya have the highest HIV/STI incidence in the country.
Food insecurity (FI) and poverty are also highly prevalent in Western Kenya, due in part to extreme weather
events and climate disasters. FI and poverty are important drivers of vulnerability to HIV and STIs among AGYW.
Poverty alleviation interventions have the potential to reduce STIs and HIV risk among AGYW but, to date, these
interventions have reported mixed findings on HIV/STI outcomes, have been primarily targeted at the individual
level, and none have focused on agriculture or FI. Therefore, there remains a critical need to develop sustainable,
multi-level, economic and FI interventions that improve AGYW STI/HIV prevention outcomes. Our team has
successfully developed a climate-adaptive, household-level agricultural intervention in Western Kenya called
Shamba Maisha (“farm life” in Kiswahili; SM) to reduce household FI. In our prior pilot study with AGYW, we
found that SM was feasible, acceptable, and associated with less FI and improved mental health. In this proposal,
we will build upon our promising SM work by examining the effectiveness and implementation of our SM
intervention, including provision of a water pump and agricultural implements for use at home, training in climate-
adaptive farming agriculture delivered at school-based demonstration farms, and adolescent-caregiver
relationship strengthening training. We plan to conduct this school- and home-based cluster randomized trial
with 800 AGYW and their primary caregivers recruited from schools in Kisumu, Homa Bay, and Migori counties.
We will randomize 20 schools in Western Kenya to intervention or control conditions and follow AGYW-caregiver
dyads for 18 months with surveys and STI/pregnancy testing to assess intervention impacts. In Aim 1, we will
determine the impact of SM on adolescent HIV prevention and sexual and reproductive health outcomes (primary
outcome is gonorrhea and/or chlamydia incidence). In Aim 2, we will assess the effect of SM on intermediate
outcomes theorized from our published conceptual framework to be on the causal pathway, including household
food security and wealth, and adolescent and caregiver factors including mental health and aspects of the
caregiver-AGYW relationship dyad (e.g., communication). In Aim 3, we will identify critical implementation
facilitators and barriers influencing SM effectiveness and delivery and conduct a programmatic cost assessment.
We will also evaluate the extent to which SM can have “spillover” nutritional benefits for a larger population of
adolescents who had access to demonstration farms at intervention schools but did not receive other aspects of
the intervention. Our ultimate goal is to provide an innovative household-level, climate-adaptive intervention to
halt the cycle of extreme weather events, FI, and poor HIV-related outcomes among vulnerable populations
including AGYW, consistent with the “Ending the HIV Epidemic” and Sustainable Development Goals."
11008445,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this Phase I STTR grant proposal, we will develop neutralizing antibodies against Machupo virus, a New World
arenavirus (NWA), by using an innovative, stabilized-trimer immunogen. Antibodies are thus far only known to
target the receptor-binding site. This novel immunogen will support discovery and characterization of neutralizing
antibodies against other critical sites in the pre-fusion conformation of the surface glycoprotein. This proposal
builds on the proof-of-concept for the related Lassa virus of the Arevirumab antibody cocktail, which combines
mAbs against both receptor-binding and fusion-blocking quaternary (trimer-bridging) epitopes to achieve late-
stage, low-dose in vivo protection.
Our approach involves utilizing advanced immunization techniques, an innovative stabilized antigen, and high-
throughput biotechnological screening to identify and characterize antibodies of complementary activities.
Provision of mAbs against complementary epitopes is also desired for development of cocktails that will prevent
mutagenic escape. The successful development of these antibodies in Phase I will set the foundation for Phase
II, where we plan to humanize and enhance the antibodies through sophisticated engineering, optimizing their
specificity and binding affinity to Machupo virus GPC. Additionally, Phase II will encompass preclinical
development, including efficacy and safety studies, to advance these antibodies towards clinical trials.
This project not only promises to advance our scientific understanding of Arenavirus pathogenesis but also aims
to develop a new class of therapeutics with potential commercial applications. Our goal is to bridge the gap from
laboratory research to clinical solutions, in line with NIH's mission to support innovative health research with
practical implications."

11008781,"This NIH SBIR Phase I project addresses the critical need for rapid, in-field, and accurate monitoring of
uranium in drinking water sources. Uranium contamination poses severe environmental and public health
risks, particularly affecting vulnerable populations. Currently, available rapid colorimetric tests lack the
sensitivity required for research and clinical purposes, demanding skilled labor and capital-intensive
equipment for accurate detection. We aim to bridge this gap by developing an innovative Surface-Enhanced
Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)-based platform capable of real-time, trace-level uranium quantification in water.
In Phase I, we will focus on developing the essential chemistry for uranyl detection using our proprietary SERS
platform. This entails creating a calibration curve with laboratory standards to achieve quantification
exceeding 10% accuracy and a detection limit below 30 ppb, aligning with the EPA Maximum Contaminant
Level. Subsequently, we will validate the detection strategy by evaluating its performance against known
interferents in lab standards and applying it to thirty real-world water samples. Rigorous testing and
comparison with established laboratory techniques will demonstrate the method's accuracy and reliability.
Our research design harnesses state-of-the-art SERS technology, offering rapid, on-site uranium
quantification. Successful completion of these aims will significantly contribute to enhanced water quality
assessment and informed decision-making, ultimately safeguarding public health and the environment. This
project serves as the cornerstone for subsequent phases, including commercialization and widespread adoption
of this groundbreaking technology."
11009167,"HIV-1 infection in infants persists at high rates despite efforts to prevent perinatal transmission. In 2022, an
estimated 130,000 new perinatal HIV-1 infections were reported globally. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is
lifesaving for these infants. However, HIV-1 creates a hidden pool of proviruses that escape HIV-1 treatment
and cause the virus to rebound. These proviruses make it necessary for children and adults to require lifelong
ART. Novel therapeutic interventions such as very early antiretroviral treatment of newborns or combining ART
with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are under study in the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent
AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) Network. These studies aim to restrict HIV-1 reservoir size to achieve ART-free
remission in neonates and infants. The proposed project will characterize proviral pool composition in neonates
and infants with HIV-1 initiating ART-free remission treatments. It will also investigate the proviral pool's
contribution to viremic rebound during therapy and analytic treatment interruption (ATI). We hypothesize that
achieving ART-free remission in infants depends on the proportion of intact proviruses and their integration
sites at treatment initiation, along with their clearance susceptibility through very early and enhanced early
treatment. We further hypothesize that clonal expansion contributes to a high proviral load before treatment
and governs the time to rebound viremia on and off ART. The Specific Aims of this proposed project are to (1)
Quantify and characterize the intact proviral pool in neonates and infants receiving very early and enhanced
early therapies toward HIV-1 ART-free remission; (2) Evaluate HIV integration sites, clonal abundance of
infected cells, infection dynamics in prenatal and early postnatal life, and viral clearance under ART
interventions; (3) Assess the potential to improve bNAb susceptibility testing in neonates and infants to fully
determine the selection and persistence of bNAb resistance during ART-free remission therapies. We plan to
use cutting-edge approaches using near full-length single genome sequencing (nFLSGS) and integration site
analyses on proviral DNA, along with a pan-subtype IPDA on genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) collected during therapy in two NIH-sponsored pediatric clinical trials involving very early
treatment of neonates and infants in combination with broadly neutralizing antibodies, IMPAACT P1115 and
2008. We will also comprehensively assess the provirus susceptibility to a panel of bNAbs and their escape
potential during bNAb therapy. The resulting data will fill a critical gap in understanding HIV-1 bNAb efficacy for
neonates and infants globally."
11022189,"Abstract
In vertebrate cells the cohesin protein complex plays critical roles in nuclear structure and
function. It tethers together the identical products of DNA replication, called sister chromatids,
until cell division and it also mediates intra-chromosomal bridging interactions, forming
chromosome loops and domains. While cohesion between sister chromatids is critical for
accurate chromosome segregation and certain kinds of DNA repair, the compaction of
chromosomes into loops and domains is essential for proper transcription and normal
development. How these different kinds of cohesion differ at the molecular level, the
mechanisms that ensure each outcome, and the amount of overlap between them are not well
understood. Using molecular genetic approaches, we are testing the impacts of specific
interactions, in multiple experimental systems, on cohesin regulation. In this application we are
requesting supplemental funds to purchase an ultra-low (-80) freezer in which to store strains,
cell lines, and proteins. Our current freezer has broken down and can no longer be repaired.
This freezer is essential for us to complete the projects described in the parent proposal."

The discovery of new small molecules that perturb the function of membrane receptors, like G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) and ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC), remains critically important to the study and
improvement of human health. Natural products are particularly well-suited for this task, as their structural
complexity and unique mechanism of action make them superior chemical probes and excellent starting points
for drug discovery. The Riley lab is focused on developing step-economic synthetic routes and robust isolation
protocols to access these complex natural product scaffolds. Through modular total syntheses, semi-synthetic
methods, and contemporary receptor assays, we transform natural products into highly potent and selective tools
for studying membrane receptors. This application describes an overview of our work and future directions in
applying these strategies to investigate the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and the kappa opioid
receptor (κOR) as representative LGIC and GPCR, respectively. The first research area builds upon our work
that recently identified members of the Aristotelia alkaloid family as potent inhibitors of the nAChRs, a major
class of LGICs, with an unusual yet desirable subtype-selectivity. During this award, we will develop streamlined
synthetic chemistry to access the entire class of Aristotelia alkaloids and generate large libraries of their
derivatives. By coupling these synthetic chemistry efforts with an expanded ability to screen for activity against
an array of nAChR subtypes and other membrane receptors, this work will deliver new chemical tools to probe
the biological function of specific nAChR subtypes. In the second research area, we will explore a novel class of
κOR agonists derived from the indole alkaloid akuammicine that were recently discovered in our laboratory. Our
initial studies identified these akuammicine derivatives are potent biased agonist that preferentially activate the
G-protein signaling pathway. Leveraging isolation protocols that provide synthetically useful quantities of
complex alkaloids directly from their natural sources, we will employ late-state diversification techniques to
rapidly generate novel derivatives that probe ligand-receptor interactions within the κOR and monitor their ability
to initiate opioid signaling cascades. We expect the results from this research will reach beyond the nAChR and
κOR and can be applied to other therapeutically relevant LGICs and GPCRs, thereby having a significant impact
on drug discovery by revealing new directions to rationally design ligands for these important membrane
receptors."
11020173,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The glymphatic-lymphatic system plays an essential role in immune surveillance and clearance of metabolic
waste. Dysfunction of the system is closely associated with neurodegenerative disorders. While the existence of
brain lymphatic vessels (mLVs) was proposed more than 200 years ago, it was only reliably confirmed with solid
experimental evidence in 2015. Fluorescent imaging and gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) have since
been used to probe the brain’s glymphatic-lymphatic system in rodents and nonhuman primates. However,
current strategies for imaging the glymphatic-lymphatic system have several limitations that preclude their use
for in vivo imaging and application in the clinical setting. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3
(VEGFR3), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is expressed exclusively by the lymphatic endothelium. Deletion of
VEGFR3 in mouse pups led to a nearly complete lack of mLVs and compromised waste clearance. In addition,
VEGFR3 may also contribute to clearing parenchymal wastes in the glymphatic system through the bidirectional
water channel aquaporin-4. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a sensitive and noninvasive imaging
modality (nM to pM) used to clinically assess metabolism, enzymes, receptors, and transporters at the molecular
level. In response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Availability of Administrative Supplements to INBRE
Awards to Fund Research Collaborations (NOT-GM-22-001), we assembled a team with the Delaware State
University (DSU). We hypothesize that fluorine-18 labeled VEGFR3-specific radiotracers can be used for real-
time PET imaging of the whole brain’s glymphatic-lymphatic system. To test our hypothesis, we propose two
aims. In Aim 1, the Co-Project Leader from DSU will use their knowledge of biomolecules and biochemical
pathways to identify a systematic biomarker relevant to whole-brain waste clearance and protein aggregation in
neurodegenerative disorders. In Aim 2, the Co-Project Leader from Nemours will design and synthesize new
imaging agents targeting the biomarkers with high binding affinity and selectivity and optimize the imaging agents
in terms of stability, BBB penetration, easy radiolabeling, and metabolic profile. The innovative proposal and
interdisciplinary collaboration will lay the foundation for further real-time live animal imaging in neurodegenerative
disorders and clinical translation for new diagnostics and therapeutics development. The pilot project will lead to
the discovery of new biomarkers in the CNS, improved imaging techniques, and ultimately, better diagnosis and
treatment of CNS diseases. Furthermore, preliminary data from this INBRE supplement will inform an R01
application by targeting PAR-23-165."
11020219,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Depression is one of the most common perinatal complications, with 1 in 7 mothers qualifying for a diagnosis of
postpartum depression (PPD). Sexual and gender minority (SGM) people experience PPD at comparable or
higher rates as cisgender, heterosexual people. Yet, extremely little is known about risk factors for PPD that are
specific to SGM people (e.g., minority stress) and there are no studies of PPD prevention or treatment among
SGM pregnant people. This project addresses these major gaps in knowledge that limit available, effective
services for preventing PPD among SGM pregnant people. It tests associations between minority stress, general
stress (i.e., cortisol), and PPD symptoms. It also examines, quantitatively and qualitatively, the benefit of a
universal (i.e., not SGM tailored) perinatal preventive intervention for PPD, delivered in English and Spanish, for
SGM pregnant people. The PPD prevention program, ROSE, is designed to increase access, scalability, and
address the mental health needs of underserved populations (e.g., racial and ethnic minority people). This
administrative supplement will leverage data collected in the parent R01, a randomized clinical trial that is testing
a virtual version against the in-person version of an evidence-based preventive intervention in a randomized
controlled trial (RCT). Data collected as part of this administrative supplement guided by minority stress and
LGBTQ health equity theories in every aim, will produce: (1) basic science on PPD among SGM and (2) a mixed-
methods evaluation of an efficacious PPD prevention program among SGM pregnant individuals. This project
will test the following aims: 1: Incorporate measures of stress relevant for sexual and gender minority individuals
across levels of analysis and examine associations of SGM-specific stress (i.e., minority stress) and general
stress (i.e., cortisol) with PPD symptoms. 2: Test if the hospital-based PPD prevention program is as effective
for SGM participants as for their cisgender, heterosexual counterparts, if the same hypothesized mediators
improve for SGM participants (e.g., social support), and examine if program effects are moderated by SGM
minority stress 3: Explore through rich qualitative data, program experiences, benefits (e.g., social support), and
unmet needs among SGM participants who completed the ROSE program, including across intersections of
minoritized SGM and racial/ethnic identities. This team, led by MPIs Davis and Rhoades, with support from Co-
I Perry, an expert in SGM health, will ensure this project’s success. The discoveries generated by this supplement
will narrow gaps in our understanding of how to effectively prevent PPD for SGM pregnant people."
11015517,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL) at Boston University (BU) was established to
generate essential information about new and reemerging infectious pathogens and the diseases they cause,
to facilitate development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, and to train future generations of scientists
to safely study pathogens with pandemic potential. It is one of two National laboratories housing both high
(Biosafety Level 3) and maximum (Biosafety Level 4) containment labs established by the National Institute of
Health (NIH) at academic medical centers as part of the Biodefence Research Program. Increasing frequency
of new and reemerging high consequence pathogens causing human (and animal) diseases and the limited
availability of proven safe and effective medical countermeasures highlight the need to improve operational
efficiency for research on Risk Group 3 pathogens. NEIDL was designed in 2003, completed in 2008, and
approved for containment research in 2018. Shortly after research operations had begun, NEIDL investigators
were faced with the need to urgently pivot to work on the new pandemic pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. This effort
revealed infrastructure deficiencies in the facility that impeded research flexibility, reduced operational
efficiency and turnaround time between studies, limited the number of pathogens and arthropod vectors that
could be investigated concurrently, and slowed scientific productivity and the development of essential medical
countermeasures and diagnostics. The following three modernization goals identified will significantly improve
our ability to manage the facility and better meet these future research needs: Goal 1. Modify Biosafety Level
(BSL)-3 and Animal Biosafety Level (ABSL)-3 spaces to facilitate individual room isolation for
decontamination and essential maintenance, allowing uninterrupted work in other BSL-3/ABSL-3 areas.
Updating the original room air pressure control systems will preclude inadvertent positive pressurization of
adjacent spaces, while the installation of additional in-parallel high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter
housings will increase capacity for extended or phased Risk Group 3 studies in animals and room by room
annual maintenance and certification. Goal 2. Renovate Arthropod Containment (High) Level space to add
capacity for tick research and permit concurrent mosquito vector studies, facilitate direct vector-to-host
transmission studies in animal models of human disease, and improve vector biosecurity when doors are
opened and closed. Goal 3. Modernize and convert the BSL-4 air locks to MicroChem as an option to
gaseous phase decontamination to reduce the required process time from days to minutes and expedite
turnaround time for studies to resume."
11007819,"ABSTRACT
HIV strains vary considerably in both genetic and phenotypic features, but all variants use CD4 as the primary
receptor and consequentially CD4+ T cells are the major target for viral infection. However, variants may use
two distinct co-receptors, CCR5 and/or CXCR4 to facilitate steps in the entry process subsequent to CD4 binding.
Both CCR5-using viruses (R5 viruses) and CXCR4-using viruses (X4 viruses) are often present during chronic
and later stages of HIV infection, but new infections are almost always seeded by R5 viruses. The host factors
that contribute to this transmission bottleneck may hold clues to host biological determinants of HIV risk, but
these factors have remained elusive. We have identified a host gene expressed in CD4+ T cells that restricts X4
virus replication and enhances R5 virus replication. Thus, this gene, SLC35A2, regulates HIV infection in a
manner that mirrors what is observed during transmission. This is the first example of a gene that specifically
restricts X4 virus infection. Because this gene was only recently discovered, its role in infection in mucosal CD4+
T cells, which are particularly important in sexual HIV transmission, has not been defined. We propose here to
examine the effect of SLC35A2 on R5 versus X4 virus infection in primary mucosal CD4+ T cells using both
single virus infections as well as virus competition experiments. Our proposed experiments will also test the
hypothesis that SLC35A2, which is a transporter of UDP-galactose and thus plays a role in glycosylation, acts
through the coreceptor early in the viral lifecycle, during fusion. These proposed high-risk, high-pay off studies
have the potential to reveal a unique role for SLC35A2 in HIV transmission biology and address a long-standing
puzzle in the field - namely why are R5 viruses selected for transmission."

The overarching goal of this research project is to enhance the understanding and prediction of heavy drinking
episodes during initial recovery (IR) from alcohol use disorder (AUD). Leveraging the latest advancements in
wearable biosensor technology and artificial intelligence (AI), this project aims to address the significant gap in
current scientific knowledge regarding the fluctuating nature of AUD recovery. Our objective is to utilize cutting-
edge wearable biosensors, like the VitalConnect VitalPatch and SCRAM-CAM, combined with sophisticated AI
methodologies, including convolution neural networks and Hidden Markov Models, to elucidate the complex
interplay of physiological and neuroclinical factors in AUD recovery. Preliminary studies utilizing AI to analyze
wearable sensor data have shown promising results in identifying behavioral phenotypes indicative of alcohol
use risk, highlighting heart rate variability (HRV) as a particularly sensitive biosignal. The proposed research
encompasses two primary aims: 1) To develop real-time predictive models using wearable sensor data that
can accurately forecast heavy drinking episodes during IR. By integrating data from electrocardiograms and
transdermal alcohol sensors with traditional self-report and behavioral assessments, we aim to construct
comprehensive profiles that can anticipate periods of heightened drinking risk. 2) To identify and understand
the neuroclinical and physiological mechanisms that contribute to or mitigate against shifts toward heavy
drinking during IR. Through repeated biopsychosocial assessments and application of explainable AI
techniques, we intend to uncover critical factors influencing recovery trajectories. Crucially, this project is
supported by a dynamic and interdisciplinary team, bringing together experts in AUD treatment research,
wearable biosensor technology, and cutting-edge AI and computational methods. This collaborative approach
ensures a multifaceted perspective on the challenges of AUD recovery and enhances the project's capacity for
innovative solutions and advanced data analysis. This project represents a novel integration of mobile health
technologies and AI analytics in the study of AUD recovery. It has the potential to transform our understanding
of IR, leading to the development of personalized, just-in-time interventions for individuals battling AUD. The
collaboration with a state-funded community-based outpatient clinic specializing in SUD treatment provides a
unique opportunity to validate our models in a real-world setting, enhancing the potential for these findings to
be translated into practical, scalable monitoring and intervention tools."
11030651,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lysosomes are the primary catabolic site of cells, serving to degrade extracellular material internalized by endocytosis
and intracellular components earmarked for turnover. These items and the hydrolytic enzymes that
degrade them are delivered to lysosomes by multiple membrane trafficking pathways, which are operated by
cellular protein machineries that are evolutionarily conserved from yeast to man. Mutations that disrupt the activities
of these machineries are linked to genetic diseases, and pathogens exploit these trafficking pathways to
establish infection. Many of the molecular mechanisms that operate membrane trafficking machineries are unknown.
My lab addresses fundamental questions about membrane trafficking to lysosomes using the budding
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a genetically tractable model organism. The major questions we plan to
address over the next five years include the following. 1) What are the physiological mechanisms that regulate
the trafficking of cell-surface receptors to the hydrolytic interior of the lysosome? This trafficking pathway functions
at endosomes to sort endocytosed receptors into membrane-enclosed transport vesicles that are delivered
into the lysosome lumen. Recent progress from my lab has revealed that the formation of these vesicles
is coordinated with other processes that are vital to cellular physiology, including ubiquitin protein homeostasis
and endocytic pH regulation. We plan to identify the machineries that interface these different cellular systems
and determine how they exert control over the protein machinery that mediates the formation of vesicles transported
to the lysosome lumen. These results will define ways in which receptor degradation is coordinated with
cellular physiology. 2) What are the mechanisms that mediate the delivery of newly synthesized transmembrane
proteins that are destined to function at the lysosomal membrane? Using novel genetic tools we created
for discovery and diagnostics, we recently identified two specific cellular machineries and several additional
candidate machineries that function in this trafficking pathway. We plan to define the mechanisms by which
these machineries function in transport, which will establish fundamental principles that underly the biogenesis
of lysosomes. Our work is bolstered by ongoing productive collaborations that employ diverse interdisciplinary
techniques, including high-resolution microscopy, biophysical analyses of protein assemblies reconstituted in
vitro, proteomics, and genetic screening. Moving forward, our overall vision is to continue exploiting yeast for
discovering and mechanistically understanding membrane trafficking to lysosomes while also addressing the
extent to which these mechanisms are conserved in human cells. The information gained from this work will
provide an understanding of how membrane trafficking pathways to lysosomes operate under normal physiological
conditions and how they are vulnerable in disease states."

the trial by a smartphone app. Research staff will collect assessments by telephone at baseline, 1- and 3-
months post-randomization. Potential participants (for all study aims) will be identified using data available from
the VA/DOD Identity Repository (VADIR) and recruited by invitational mailing and follow-up telephone calls.
Inclusion criteria: 1) U.S. Veteran that separated from military service in the past 12 months (any discharge
type); 2) >18 years old; 3) experiencing suicidal ideation; 4) low intent to seek help; 5) capable of
understanding the goals of the study; 6) willing and able to provide verbal consent; and 7) smartphone
ownership and willing to download/use study mobile app (for Aims 2 & 3). Exclusion criteria: 1) currently (or in
the past 12 months) in formal mental health treatment services; 2) deemed impaired during eligibility
screening; and 3) currently institutionalized. Women and minorities will be included in the study. Next
Steps/Implementation: If the intervention is found effective, we will work with our VA operational partner to
include messages in future outreach approaches to prevent Veteran suicide and use findings to improve
current communication performance measures."

seeking for recently separated Veterans at risk for suicide and resistant to initiate mental health care. Aim 3:
Examine facilitators and barriers of message use to identify methods for effectively reaching and engaging
Veterans at risk for suicide in the first year following separation from service. Methodology: We propose a
four-year mixed methods study that uses a sequential embedded design to collect data from nationwide
samples of Veterans at risk for suicide not in mental health treatment who separated from the DoD in the past
year. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, individual interviews will first be conducted to guide the
design of effective public messages that will be subsequently tested in a two-arm RCT to determine exposure
effects among targeted audience vs. control group. Messages will be disseminated to study participants during
the trial by a smartphone app. Research staff will collect assessments by telephone at baseline, 1- and 3-
months post-randomization. Potential participants (for all study aims) will be identified using data available from
the VA/DOD Identity Repository (VADIR) and recruited by invitational mailing and follow-up telephone calls.
Inclusion criteria: 1) U.S. Veteran that separated from military service in the past 12 months (any discharge
type); 2) >18 years old; 3) experiencing suicidal ideation; 4) low intent to seek help; 5) capable of
understanding the goals of the study; 6) willing and able to provide verbal consent; and 7) smartphone
ownership and willing to download/use study mobile app (for Aims 2 & 3). Exclusion criteria: 1) currently (or in
the past 12 months) in formal mental health treatment services; 2) deemed impaired during eligibility
screening; and 3) currently institutionalized. Women and minorities will be included in the study. Next
Steps/Implementation: If the intervention is found effective, we will work with our VA operational partner to
include messages in future outreach approaches to prevent Veteran suicide and use findings to improve
current communication performance measures."

 Recent progresses in microbial genome sequencing and synthetic biology have created
a renaissance in natural product discovery. This timely combination offers great promise to find
natural products displaying new structures and biological activities. Notwithstanding such
potential, it remains difficult to i) predict product structures directly from biosynthetic gene
clusters (BGCs). This is because our knowledge of enzymes that are involved in natural product
biosynthesis remains limited, especially with regard to the highly programmed enzymes from
eukaryotic organisms such as filamentous fungi; ii) prioritize BGCs that can lead to new-to-
nature chemical structures. This is primarily due to the focus of the field on well-studied natural
product families and core biosynthetic enzymes; and iii) connect the biological activity with
BGCs in genome mining efforts. This represents a gap between genome mining and traditional
phenotypical screen-based discovery in which natural product isolation is guided by biological
activity. This MIRA grant will address these limitations with a comprehensive research program
focused on fungal natural product discovery and biosynthetic investigation.
 The first general area of this MIRA project is to gain fundamental understanding of core
enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of fungal natural products. In particular, we will
focus on understanding the iterative programming rules of fungal PKSs and NRPSs. Other
aspects of core enzyme programming rules, including cyclization and noncanonical domains will
be investigated. We will also investigate the unusual tailoring enzyme activities of fungal
biosynthetic pathways, with emphasis on PLP-dependent and oxidative enzymes. A number of
compound driven biosynthetic investigations will be conducted. The second general area of this
MIRA project is to develop and refine tools for genome mining. The most important research
activity in this area is based on our recently developed resistance gene guided target genome
mining, in which we use an co-clustered, resistant variant of the natural product target in the
BGC as a guide to discover natural product of desired biological activity. This strategy can also
be used to assign biological activities to known natural products. The objectives here are two-
fold: 1) to expand the list of targets that may be identified via resistance gene, to enzymes and
proteins in the central dogma, protein transport, metabolism, etc. Here we will perform genome
mining and/or natural product bioactivity characterization to link metabolites to targets; and 2) to
understand the mechanism of resistance, which will teach us how Nature evolves resistant
enzymes, and refine our understanding of how to overcome potential resistance."
11031036,"GPCRs are the largest family of mammalian membrane receptors with an established relevance in therapy,
representing a third of the currently FDA-approved drugs. Particularly GsPCRs via cAMP are involved in many
physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Classically considered to originate solely from the plasma
membrane, this view was recently challenged by observations showing that GsPCRs, upon internalization, can
sustain cAMP signaling from intracellular compartments. Most importantly, this second endocytic cAMP phase
was strictly associated with nuclear transcriptional events responsible for the generation of specific biological
responses, like chronic inflammation, chronic pain, and migraine, conditions that affect millions worldwide.
However, the molecular mechanisms involved in sustained signaling are still unknown. Their characterization
should deepen our understanding of the GPCRs’ spatiotemporal organization and function and may provide
novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. We have identified a novel GαS-independent CAP1-Rap1-AC9
regulatory unit and its potential involvement in sustained signaling will be addressed in this proposal.
The scientific premise for this proposal is based on the identification of a novel GαS-independent CAP1-Rap1
complex directly regulating AC9. Utilizing novel optogenetic actuators and targeting strategies, we will test the
hypothesis that upon the first plasma membrane-generated GαS-dependent cAMP wave, this new intracellular
GαS-independent CAP1-Rap1-AC9 regulatory unit is responsible for the sustained cAMP phase.
Four integrated specific aims are proposed to experimentally test this hypothesis. In SA #1 we will characterize
AC9 as the CAP1-Rap1-sensitive tmAC isoform involved in the potentiation of cAMP dynamics in cells. In SA #2
we will identify and characterize key residues in AC9 that discriminate GαS and Rap1 binding. In SA #3, we will
use the ALFA-tag targeting strategy to bring sensors (AC9-ALFA/Nb-ALFA-H188) close to AC9 to test the
hypothesis that the AC9-CAP1-Rap1 ternary complex establishes a compartmentalized positive feedback loop
responsible for the GPCR sustained cAMP wave. Finally, in SA #4, we will use GαS- and Rap1-targeted
disruptors to uncouple functional GαS- and Rap1-dependent cyclase activation events in the plasma membrane
and intracellular AC9 compartments.
Our laboratory’s long-standing interest is to understand the spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP-dependent
signaling events. A multidisciplinary approach combining biochemistry, optogenetics, and nanobody-targeted
strategies will be exploited to test the role of AC9-CAP1-Rap1 in compartmentalized cAMP signaling.
Successful completion of the proposed studies should provide new insights into the mechanism/s cells utilize
to compute (code/decode) the relay of the cAMP signal (i.e., fidelity, specificity, efficiency) and provide us
opportunities in the identification of new subcellular localized targets for pharmacological intervention of this
critical second messenger pathway."
11031063,"Project summary (From R35)
 “Evolutionary innovation” refers to the origin of entirely new traits, as opposed to the modification of
existing traits. Although such novelties are relatively rare, all the complexity and diversity of life have
ultimately been shaped by evolutionary innovations that occurred in a nested pattern, with every innovation
dependent on many earlier novelties. Despite their critical importance for everything from geological nutrient
cycles that support all life on Earth to human sentience that distinguishes us from our closest relatives, the
molecular mechanisms of evolutionary innovations are understood far less than the evolution of existing traits.
This is true at all levels of biological organization, from single molecules to the most complex features of
animal form and function. We understand the evolution of existing organs and cell types better than the origin
of new ones; quantitative variation in gene expression has been explored in greater detail than the origin of
new regulatory pathways; much more is known about the evolution of existing genes than about the origin of
new genes, and so on. It is this gap in knowledge that motivates our work.
 To achieve a comprehensive understanding of evolutionary innovations, it is necessary to connect
novelties at all levels of biological organization: from new functional elements in the genome, to new genetic
pathways, to new morphological structures. Research in our lab will advance in several directions, using the
Drosophila model system. First, we will identify the key DNA sequences changes responsible for the origin
of a new morphological structure that evolved recently in Drosophila. Second, we will characterize the cell
differentiation pathway that translates these changes into novel morphologies and reconstruct how this
pathway was assembled in the course of evolution. Third, we will look more broadly at how ancestral genes
acquire new expression patterns. We will test whether cooption of old genes into new tissues involves
modification of existing regulatory sequences or the origin of new regulatory elements. Finally, we will
reconstruct the origin of new regulatory elements from non-functional ancestral sequences. By focusing on
new genes that evolved within natural populations of a single species, we will identify the series of mutations
that create new regulatory elements in the genome. Together, these approaches will promote a deep
mechanistic understanding of evolutionary innovations."
11017252,"ABSTRACT
STING (stimulator of interferon genes), a cytoplasmic sensor for cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), plays a crucial role
as an adaptor molecule for a number of intracellular DNA receptors. The upstream DNA sensors that signal
through STING include cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), IFN-inducible proteins, and DExD/H-box helicase
family proteins, highlighting an important function for STING in controlling multiple DNA recognition pathways.
STING has been crucial in host defense against viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens, and also to the
development of autoimmune disease. Abnormalities in this defense mechanism can underpin a spectrum of
conditions, including cancer and autoinflammatory diseases. STING is thus a highly promising drug target.
Recent studies have underscored the role of STING in regulating intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis. As
high levels of microbiota-derived DNA and CDNs are present in the gut, these stimuli could contribute to local
activation of STING at steady state. Sting-/- mice have been reported to develop more severe colitis upon acute
inflammatory insult. Our preliminary data demonstrated that T cells expressed STING at levels higher than that
in dendritic cells (DCs). Furthermore, activation of STING signaling promoted T cell production of IL-10 and IL-
22 but inhibited IL-17 production, indicating that STING may potentially regulate intestinal homeostasis and colitis
development by promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10/IL-22 and inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine production by
T cells. In this application, we will test whether STING promotes T cell production of IL-10 and IL-22 by inducing
IRF4 and AHR expression mediated by the production of type I IFNs by both T cells and dendritic cells, which
would lead to the preservation of intestinal immune homeostasis and inhibition of IBD. Furthermore, we will test
whether STING agonists can prevent and treat colitis."

application is to buildout a multi-disciplinary 16,000 square foot integrated shared service core facility ;
""Expanding Infrastructure for Translational and Health Disparities Research at Florida A&M University""
(FAMU-EIR) to facilitate the growing demands for physical space, required for collaborations between
biomedical and behavioral research focusing on solutions for minority health and health disparities. FAMU
is a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) first established in Tallahassee, Florida in 1887,
which today makes it geographically ideal for serving the surrounding counties with large African
American populations. FAMU is also an institute of emerging excellence (42 USC 283k(c)(2)) and a
Carnegie R2-High Research Activity University. FAMUs College of Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences,
Institute of Public Health (CoPPS, IPH), is one of the many FAMU research intensive facilities with
minority student bodies abiding in a unified central principal mission to serve and educate the African-
American community through instruction, research, and community outreach, in order to reduce health
disparities. The proposed FAMU-EIR will overcome major deficiencies in physical infrastructure stemming
from logistical inefficiencies such as workflow dispersed across three separate buildings (one of which is
slated for future demolition); to the University as a whole, an outreach center for community engagement
is sorely needed. A centralized FAMU-EIR facility is in alignment with FAMUs 2030 defined goals; to
obtain classification as a Carnegie R1-Very High Research Activity Institution ; as well as those of its
research funding agencies such as NIH-funded U54 Research Centers for Minority Institutions (RCMI)
and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) U54 Funded Florida-California (CARE2) Health Equity Center.
The proposed space for the facility is present and allocated for this very purpose, on Level 4, as one of 2
open- empty shell floors, in the Phase 2 New Pharmacy building (NPB), a five-story addition to the NPB
Phase 1 funded by the Florida Legislature in 2014-2015. The building is architecturally sound and Level 4
will be built out using LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) concepts developed by the
U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) abiding in efficiency, life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) for optimized
sustainability, quality and function. The much needed FAMU-EIR facility will serve as a central
multidisciplinary service hub, strategically designed to encourage intercommunication between
researchers in a tandem workflow with the behavioral/public health/community engagement center
fostering ongoing trans-disciplinary workflow and innovative translational technologies, leaving a lasting
legacy of societal impact.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), consisting of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, is a common
and consequential public health problem affecting up to 600,000 adults in the United States annually. VTE
requires timely detection and treatment, but the VTE diagnosis workflow in ambulatory care is fraught with
challenges, including delays, inaccuracies, and misdirection, influenced by multiple factors including
nonspecific symptoms and a lack of systematic measurement and quality improvement tools. VTE is
associated with health disparities (highest in black and African American populations) and missed or delayed
VTE diagnosis can have serious consequences for patient and healthcare cost outcomes, resulting in
increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stays. These issues may be further compounded
by variation in the types of ambulatory care practices (primary care versus urgent care) and the geographical
locations and socio-economic status where patients seek care.
Our team developed an electronic clinical quality measure (eCQM) that uses structured and unstructured EHR
data to measure Diagnostic Delay of Venous Thromboembolism (DOVE) in primary care settings that was
recently endorsed by the Partnership for Quality Measurement. Using this eCQM, the rate of delayed VTE
diagnosis in urban, metro, and rural primary care practices across three large healthcare systems using
different EHR systems was found to be consistently over 70%, suggesting that this is an important type of
diagnostic error (DE) with likely negative impacts on patient outcomes.
Building on our preliminary work, we propose to leverage EHR data and stakeholder expertise to gain an
understanding of VTE DE risk factors, disparities and outcomes. We will develop artificial intelligence (AI) and
statistical learning tools to identify, factorize, and address vulnerabilities in a range of VTE DE workflows
including delayed and missed VTE diagnosis in both ambulatory and urgent care settings. This study brings
together a strong interdisciplinary team of experts in primary care, VTE diagnosis, informatics, data science
(natural language processing and machine learning). The advanced data-driven eCQM will be refined using
high-dimensional EHR data (structured and unstructured) to quantfy timely, delayed and missed VTE
diagnoses. To increase generalizability of the results, we will use multiple data sources from 220 primary
care/urgent care practices and clinics associated with 13 hospitals from urban, metro and rural clinics in the
Northeastern and Southern United States (2 different EHR vendors). If successful, this approach will
substantially improve our understanding of DEs and related risk factors, VTE DE related costs and build a
foundation for improving VTE diagnostic accuracy and precision and diminish disparities in healthcare
outcomes."
11007442,"Project Summary/Abstract
 HIV remains a major global health issue; strict adherence to combined antiretroviral therapy can reduce
a patient's active virus to undetectable levels, but the presence of latent viral reservoirs necessitates lifelong
adherence to antiretrovirals. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a major target in the treatment of HIV as it is
responsible for producing a double stranded DNA copy of the viral genome, which can be integrated into the
host. RT inhibitors fall into two major classes: nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs) which are incorporated into the
growing DNA chain but usually lack the 3' hydroxyl group needed to continue reverse transcription, and non-
nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) which bind to an allosteric pocket 10Å away from the active site, causing a
conformational change which alters the rate of chemical catalysis. These two classes of inhibitors are typically
combined when treating patients to provide more protection against inevitable drug-resistant mutants. In cells,
NNRTIs have shown synergy with NRTIs, but some in vitro experiments suggest that NRTI incorporation and
NNRTI binding are mutually exclusive. The molecular mechanism which underlies these drug interactions
remains unclear. Additionally, recent studies have revealed that a subset of NNRTIs can enhance RT
homodimerization and induce HIV-specific pyroptosis by prematurely activating the viral protease. This subset
of compounds may be promising components of new “shock and kill” therapies, which aim to cure HIV by
activating viral reservoirs and killing HIV-infected cells. While these dual function NNRTIs would represent an
exciting advancement in HIV treatment, the mechanistic and structural features of this process are not yet
understood. The proposed project will provide insights into the allosteric interactions underlying these
two key processes using complementary kinetic, structural, and dynamic methodologies. In Aim 1, I will
investigate the mechanism for crosstalk between the active site and the NNRTI-binding site. To do this, I will
use transient kinetic analyses to determine whether incoming nucleotides can be incorporated in the presence
of a covalent NNRTI, which cannot be displaced. Additionally, I will identify long-range interactions responsible
for allosteric inhibition with HDX MS experiments. In Aim 2, I will identify key structural characteristics of
dimerizing NNRTIs and the underlying mechanism by which they mediate this dimerization effect. To do this, I
will use complementary X-ray crystallography and cryoEM techniques to determine the structures of NNRTIs
bound to the p66/p66 homodimer and p66 monomer and identify the interactions between dimerizing NNRTIs
and their binding site(s) which are responsible for this effect. I will also monitor the progression from p66
monomer to p66 homodimer in the presence of dimerizing NNRTIs by HDX MS to determine the mechanism
by which they enhance dimerization. The insights gleaned from the proposed experiments will lay the
foundation for the development of novel NNRTIs which have better synergy with NRTIs and are more potent
enhancers of RT homodimerization."

 The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop and test the prototype of an online alcohol prevention
game appropriate for 13-15 year olds. The game emphasizes the prevention of alcohol use and misuse as well
as using other drugs and engaging in antisocial activities. While empirical studies confirm that there are
numerous paths adolescents who use and misuse alcohol follow, there is strong empirical evidence that
several psychosocial variables can play a key role in deterring the onset and progression of alcohol use.
Among the key elements that prior research supports is strengthening perceptions that involvement with
alcohol does not fit with a desired lifestyle. Research also supports a normative education approach that
reinforces the belief that use among the peer group is not as common nor as acceptable as some might think.
Further, teaching skills to form friendships with positive peers and eschew affiliating with high-risk peers also
provides protection and reduces the risk of using alcohol and engaging in other illicit and antisocial behaviors.
 Classmates is designed to address these psychosocial risk and protective factors by engaging players in
an experience that simulates the process of finding new friends and engaging in activities that either support or
detract from pursuing one’s life’s goal and desired future. Players will select a future to pursue from among six
possibilities, to be: creative, fit, popular, rich, talented, or smart. Each of 12 non-playing characters (NPCs) in
the game will have a profile that matches one of the possible futures the player selects. Players will be
rewarded when they form friendships with NPCs who share their desired future. Through the development of
friendships, players will learn what activities are congruent with their life’s goal. NPCs will also be randomly
assigned a level of behavioral and psychosocial risk. Higher risk NPCs will occasionally invite players to
engage in antisocial or illicit activities, including alcohol and other forms of drug use. Game mechanics will
challenge players to identify NPCs who can help them further their future aspirations. At the same time players
will learn to identify and eventually avoid NPCs who will increase their risk of alcohol and other illicit and
antisocial behaviors. Choosing among NPCs and activities will accommodate multiple game play strategies.
 Working with our partners, Filament Games and High Point University’s game design program, we will craft
and test a prototypical version of the game. We will recruit 20 adolescents to provide feedback and guidance
about game details. Pairs of interviewees will then meet online and discuss topics related to their lives and
common social interactions. Transcriptions will allow us to create a natural language library that can be used
as a resource for crafting NPCs’ dialog. A separate group of 20 adolescents will play the prototype, provide
think aloud feedback, and rate playability of the game. The Phase I trial will result in both qualitative and
quantitative outcomes that will demonstrate the feasibility of the game and the viability of a Phase II project."
11008950,"The International Association for Dental Research, (DBA International Association for Dental, Oral, and
Craniofacial Research) (IADR), intends to facilitate the attendance and active participation of the most
promising graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, and early career faculty at the 9th World Workshop on Oral
Health & Disease in AIDS – Translating Knowledge to Improve Equitable Oral Health (WW9). Despite
advances in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment, communities such as at-risk populations of men who have
sex with men, transgender people, sex workers, people who use drugs, and adolescents, still lack access to
HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care services that they need due in part to HIV-related stigma and
discrimination which impedes the current response to HIV/AIDS around the world.
Specific Aims:
1. To provide an overview of current trends and strategies of prevention and treatment in the management
of AIDS patients with special emphasis pertaining to oral health and disease.
2. To identify research gaps where further research would lead to new and exciting translational
approaches and successfully contribute to the global research agenda in the field.
3. To address oral health and disease in high-risk populations including transgender communities.
4. To provide a means by which researchers at the earliest stage of their careers are exposed to the most
recent HIV/AIDs research findings from around the world.
WW9 will appraise the advances in HIV/AIDS research since the last conference in this series and is a unique
opportunity to integrate and share recent HIV/AIDS research from all parts of the world. No other meeting
provides researchers in fields related to the oral aspects of HIV infection the chance to meet in such a convivial
setting. The workshop's intent is to bring together oral health clinicians and investigators to share worldwide
perspectives, knowledge and understanding of oral health connected to HIV/AIDS; and to identify research
gaps considering worldwide perspectives and opportunities.
This funding request is to provide travel support for early career investigators to participate in the workshop
that will help to shape the future of HIV/AIDS oral research. It is anticipated that those receiving support from
this conference grant will take the knowledge acquired at the workshop back to and apply it in their own
programs, thus contributing to HIV/AIDS research, care, and education in their own countries.
WW9 proceedings will be submitted for publication and will summarize research priorities for the future of the
field. The proceedings from WW9 will serve as an invaluable tool for funding agencies, institutions, scientific
societies, and individual investigators in the field of oral health and HIV/AIDS research."
11007965,"Summary
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a ubiquitous impact on human health. ROS are directly involved in
maintenance of homoeostasis and implicated in disease when misregulated. Currently there is a gap in
technologies capable of characterizing and quantifying these important analytes in physiologically relevant
conditions (e.g., whole blood). This Phase II SBIR continues development of a quantum sensing technology to
perform accurate and accessible kinetic measurements of ROS in minimally processed biofluids. Once
developed, the new technology will improve the understanding the roles these species play in disease
pathogenesis. It is also expected to enable new modalities for drug and biomarker discovery which could
potentially aid in clinical diagnostics. The translational capability of quantum sensors lies in equipping biomedical
researchers and clinicians with new measurement tools offering improved sensitivity, resolution, and speed
compared to classical sensors. The proposed new family of robust quantum sensors is based on nitrogen-
vacancy (NV) centers fabricated in nanodiamonds (NDs). NDNV sensors possess unique magneto-optical
quantum properties, where the optical output of the NV depends on its spin state, while the spin state, in turn, is
highly sensitive to paramagnetic species/free radicals present nearby. The value of the proposed technology is
that the measurements may be reproducibly performed in a media with a high background fluorescence, like
whole blood. To achieve this goal, this Phase II SBIR aims at developing a prototype instrument which will be
further commercialized in Phase III of this project. We will also continue development of the ND-NV sensor and
validation of its performance with measurements in translationally relevant whole blood samples. Our team has
complementary expertise in ND processing and commercialization and instrumentation prototyping (Adámas),
development of cutting-edge detection/validation schemes in electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and
chemical synthesis (NCSU), and clinical research (Duke Medical Center). The outcome of this project will be a
sensor with the capability to perform measurements of ROS in whole blood with minimal processing. We
anticipate that the greatly reduced assay time and preserved sample integrity will increase the reliability of ROS
measurement in basic biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. We aim to provide the full technology
solution to end users including an instrument and consumable reagents for conducting Quantum Sensing ROS
assays."
11017367,"Increasing efforts are being made to understand whether early intervention after HIV-1 infection can enable long-
term viral control and reduction of the viral reservoir through the preservation of HIV-1-specific immune
responses. Recently, the pioneering eCLEAR phase 1b/2a clinical trial led by MPI SØgaard, found that
administration of the HIV-Env specific broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) 3BNC117 at antiviral therapy (ART)
initiation enhanced CD8+ T cell viral immunity and enabled viral control amongst participants harboring
3BNC117-sensitive viruses. However, the mechanisms underlying this outcome remain largely unknown.
Understanding The goal of this collaborative R01 (M Betts, UPenn, B Jones, Weill-Cornell University, and
O. SØgaard, Aarhus University) is to define the mechanisms underlying this protective outcome in order
to inform future development of targeted immunotherapy at ART initiation as an HIV cure strategy. We
hypothesize that the partial success of eCLEAR can be defined in terms of both specific mechanisms of
efficacious CD8+ T-cell responses and of the features selected in remaining reservoir-harboring cells. We will
address this hypothesis in three integrated Aims using samples directly from the eCLEAR study. In Aim 1, we
will define phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic features of the adaptive T cell immune responses that are
modulated by bNAb treatment at ART initiation (SØgaard). In Aim 2, we will define how the HIV reservoir is
differentially modulated after prolonged ART treatment and within post-therapy viral controllers vs. non-
controllers who received 3BNC117 (Betts). In Aim 3, we will define the ability of CD8+ T cells from eCLEAR
participants who did or did not exhibit post-ART control to mediate viral control in vivo using a novel humanized
mouse model. In addition, we will modulate CD8+ T cell functions within this system to uncover specific control
mechanisms. The anticipated outcomes of our project are i) A comprehensive characterization of the
immunologic and reservoir features associated with the partial efficacy of eCLEAR, ii) Validation of underlying
mechanisms, to guide future iterations of clinical interventions at the time of ART initiation."
11015561,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. As a Comprehensive Cancer Center with a mission to `understand,
prevent and cure cancer', Roswell Park has long recognized the value of human biospecimens linked with
clinical and outcomes data for driving research discoveries. As such, the institute has supported the collection
and banking of remnant tumor tissue from surgical procedures in the Pathology Network Shared Resource
(PNSR) and the collection and storage of peripheral blood samples in the Hematologic Procurement Shared
Resource (HPSR) and the DataBank and BioRepository (DBBR). Furthermore, samples from specific research
initiatives, including large multi-institutional team science grants, have also been banked for research use.
Unfortunately, these efforts have all arisen independently of each other with no coordinated vision or
standardized operating procedures, resulting in scores of -80 and liquid nitrogen (LN2) freezers spread across
the Roswell Park campus. The haphazard and fragmented growth of these resources and the fact that some of
these collections have inventories that cannot be electronically queried by the Roswell Park research
community has made access to these samples difficult and has delayed advances in biomedical research.
Importantly, with some epidemiological studies including thousands of participants with multiple aliquots of
blood components for each, retrieval of samples for analysis is an extremely laborious and time-consuming
process, and keeping freezer doors opened for long periods of time to retrieve samples jeopardizes sample
integrity. Here we propose to consolidate sample procurement, processing and banking for the three existing
shared resources (PNSR, HPSR, and DBBR) and external studies into ONE Biorepository – a comprehensive
and unified biobanking system with accompanying services at Roswell Park. We will also construct a state-of-
the-art biospecimen storage facility on the first floor of GBSB, centered around acquisition of a Hamilton BiOS
M6, an ultra-low temperature automated storage system with robotic sample handling and retrieval, such that
freezer doors are never opened, thereby maintaining the highest levels of biospecimen integrity during storage,
tracking and accession. ONE Biorepository will be accompanied by a renovated laboratory space that can
accommodate the operational needs of all three preexisting biobanks and their research services. The newly
renovated Biorepository and laboratory facilities enable streamlined and efficient practices for the processing,
banking and use of human samples to advance biomedical research, at Roswell and with our regional and
national NIH-funded partners."
11020050,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Submitted in response to RFA-DA-24-063, we propose to develop novel, brain-penetrant, small molecule biased
allosteric modulators (BAMs) of the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) to attenuate relapse to opioid seeking in
individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). NTSR1 is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is highly
expressed in dopamine (DA)-rich brain regions and modulates brain DA signaling. NTSR1 ligands counter the
effects of multiple classes of misused drugs. As a GPCR, NTSR1 signals via heterotrimeric G proteins and β-
arrestin proteins. While NTSR1 has long been recognized as a promising target for the treatment of chemical
addictions, development of balanced NTSR1 agonists that active both pathways is precluded by on-target side
effects (i.e., hypothermia, hypotension). Our collaborative team developed a series of first-in-class β-arrestin
BAMs of the NTSR1, which attenuate psychostimulant drug effects without the side effects characteristic of
balanced NTSR1 activation. While NTSR1 is a well-established therapeutic target for stimulant use disorders,
and its mechanism of action suggests utility that spans drug class, its validity as a target for OUD has not been
rigorously established. The limited data available on NTSR1’s effect on opioid action is promising. Our data
suggest that first generation β-arrestin NTSR1 BAMs act via a reward mechanism conserved across drug classes
and attenuate both stimulant and opioid drug self-administration. In aim 1, we will validate NTSR1 as a drug
target for the treatment of OUD with our optimized lead BAMWe will leverage a mouse model of relapse to
intravenous (IV) opioid seeking, NTSR1 knockout (NTSR1-/-) mice, and our extensive knowledge of β-arrestin
BAM pharmacology. Recently, we discovered that these compounds block NTSR1 signaling via some G
proteins, but permit signaling via others. Because balanced NTSR1 agonists promote drug seeking, we
hypothesize that this G protein permissiveness detracts from the therapeutic utility of these BAMs in OUD. In
aim 2, we will discover next generation β-arrestin BAMs for NTSR1 with improved β-arrestin selectivity
to test this hypothesis. We conducted comprehensive signaling characterization for a panel of ligands from our
lead series. In addition, we have robust cell-based assays (and appropriate counter-screens) to reliably monitor
NTSR1 activation of more than 14 transducers. Leveraging these assets, we will conduct a medicinal chemistry
campaign to increase the potency and β-arrestin selectivity of BAM scaffold, with a flow scheme consisting of
cell-based receptor signaling assays and early assessment of ADME, brain penetration, and central NTSR1
engagement. We have stringent criteria for second-generation leads. Compounds that match this profile will be
advanced to efficacy testing in a model of relapse to IV remifentanil seeking in wild-type and NTSR1-/- mice. This
multidisciplinary research plan capitalizes on the unique scientific and drug discovery expertise of our team and
is a critical step towards our goal of developing therapeutics to facilitate recovery in individuals with OUD."
11018935,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Opioids exert a plethora of behavioral effects that include clinically beneficial analgesia and untoward
euphoria that leads to their abuse. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to opioids is associated with the
development of dependence and tolerance that drive relapse and contribute to overdose and grave side- effects.
All of these effects are mediated by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), strategically positioned in neurons that form
reward and nociceptive circuits. Furthermore, MOR signaling is involved in development of addiction to a wide
range of drugs of abuse. The overarching goal of our efforts is to dissociate the behavioral effects associated
with activation MOR signaling in neural circuits to curb the development of dependence. Our strategy to achieve
this goal is to use large scale, unbiased approaches to identify novel modulators of MOR signaling and then
apply high throughput chemical biology strategies to target these components with small molecule compounds.
 By conducting an unbiased forward genetic screen we have recently identified several novel receptor-like
components that exert “anti-opioid” activity by modifying MOR signaling. Proof-of-principle experiments with
knockout mice show that elimination of these elements profoundly alters behavioral responses to opioids
diminishing the dependence and tolerance while increasing analgesia. Based on these observations we
propose to use high throughput approach to develop pharmacological tools for redirecting MOR signals to
specifically manipulate with opioid responses modifying addictive behaviors.
 Specifically, we plan to follow up on the discovery of the diverse set of compounds identified in high-
throughput screening campaign, optimizing them using medicinal chemistry for achieving selective and specific
alterations of MOR signaling. We will characterize the compounds and undertake their development efforts
culminating in studying the effects on modifying opioid responses with circuit specific resolution using innovative
optical strategies for recording neuromodulation in brain slices. Finally, we will investigate in vivo actions of the
developed tool compounds testing their activity in rodent models of pain and addiction using a comprehensive
battery of behavioral assays. These efforts will be paralleled by conducting in vivo pharmacokinetics,
pharmacodynamics and toxicology studies. It is expected that this effort should result in a development of
precision tools for understanding opioid receptor signaling and dissociating opioid effects with circuits and
molecular specificity."

Bones in the craniofacial complex are susceptible to various disease conditions due to sustained functional
demand associated with essential activities for survival, such as mastication, respiration, and swallowing.
Craniofacial bones are highly adaptable to external forces, as exemplified by the classical functional matrix
hypothesis; paradoxically, craniofacial bones have limited inherent regeneration potential. While significant
progress has been made in unraveling mechanisms of congenital craniofacial bone deformities, there is a
fundamental gap in knowledge regarding how craniofacial formation is dynamically regulated in response to
incessant functional demand in later life. This gap leads to an insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of
craniofacial bone diseases that clinicians commonly observe in dental practice settings. Dr. Noriaki Ono is an
orthodontist-scientist and a mid-career bone biologist with a steadfast focus on skeletal stem cells and bone
development, with a highly productive research program and a substantial track record of contribution to the
bone research field. The overall vision is to establish a craniofacial bone disease program focusing on
skeletal stem cell plasticity as a central mechanism of craniofacial bone formation in intramembranous
and endochondral pathways. This proposal aims to develop a research program to address fundamental
mechanisms of craniofacial bone diseases from the perspective of skeletal stem cells and their lineage
plasticity. The proposed research program will capitalize on the team's established expertise in mouse genetic
in vivo lineage-tracing approaches and collaborations with single-cell computational biologists. Program 1:
The first program investigates craniofacial skeletal stem cells in the intramembranous pathway. We will
interrogate the fates and functions of periosteal and endosteal stem cells using intersectional genetic
approaches to define how these cells contribute to bone formation in load-bearing craniofacial bones under
normal and regenerative conditions. Program 2: The second program investigates craniofacial chondrocyte
plasticity in the endochondral pathway. We will use high-dimensional single-cell level spatial transcriptomics to
define mechanisms regulating chondrocyte plasticity in the cranial base synchondrosis and mandibular
condylar cartilage. Program 3: The third program capitalizes on two novel craniofacial bone disease models of
idiopathic condylar resorption (endochondral) and osteonecrosis of the jaw (intramembranous) induced by
genetic manipulation in resident stem cell populations. We will delve into in-depth molecular and cellular
mechanisms governing skeletal stem cell plasticity in load-bearing craniofacial bones and how its dysregulation
leads to these disease conditions. The avenue for future clinical translation will be laid with highly collaborative
oral and maxillofacial surgeons at UTHealth Houston. Together, these research programs are expected to
establish skeletal stem cell dysregulation as a fundamental tenet of craniofacial bone diseases, which will
serve as a critical therapeutic target of clinically prevalent conditions in autotherapies."
11008082,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fetal lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO) is a severe birth defect that results in damage or malformation of
the bladder, kidneys, and lungs. LUTO is associated with an up to 80% mortality risk, and survivors continue
to suffer life-long complications associated with their kidneys and urinary and pulmonary systems. LUTO can
be treated by performing fetal surgery (usually in the second or third trimester) to implant a vesicoamniotic
shunt (VAS). This creates an alternate channel between the bladder and amniotic space that bypasses the
bladder obstruction, improves amniotic fluid volume, and rescues lung development during gestation.
 Existing VAS are associated with a dislodgement rate up to 80%, which often necessitates repeat invasive
procedures to replace the shunt. Due to the risks of the operation and its high inherent failure rate, VAS
treatment is typically performed in the most severe LUTO cases (~10%). This indicates a large unmet need.
 Vortex Medical is developing a novel fetal VAS that incorporates enhanced anchors (fixation) to reduce
dislodgement, materials that enhance the shunt's visibility on ultrasound to optimize shunt deployment, and a
reinforced channel that resists kinking and can extend as the fetus grows. We have prototyped the design and
tested the device's performance in bench tests and a pilot study in fetal sheep. These studies suggest the
Vortex shunt is superior to currently available shunts, delivering proof-of-concept for our design.
 In the proposed Fast-Track SBIR project, we will refine the design of the Vortex shunt and complete
preclinical testing. In Phase I, we will optimize the design of the conduit and the method for joining the conduit
and anchors. We will subject prototypes to gestation-equivalent fatigue and then verify performance to ensure
the design is robust to fetal movements. Subsequently, we will hold a pre-submission meeting with the FDA to
solidify the preclinical testing plan. In Phase II, we will optimize the design of the delivery system, develop
scalable manufacturing methods, conduct verification and validation testing, and complete usability studies
with fetal surgeons in a simulated clinical environment. These efforts will provide the foundation for our IDE
application to the FDA to begin first-in-human trials. The Vortex shunt will follow the same regulatory pathway
as current shunts with a humanitarian use designation (HUD).
 The proposed efforts will lay the groundwork to bring the Vortex shunt one step closer to impacting the
long-term outcomes for prenatal LUTO patients. The Vortex shunt will improve the efficacy of prenatal LUTO
treatment, which will reduce mortality and complications and result in healthcare savings of millions of dollars
annually in the US alone. Furthermore, by improving the safety and reliability of VAS therapy, it will extend the
potential for treatment to many patients who currently have no option."
11008153,"1 Abstract – More than 500,000 surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States to address
 2 peripheral nerve injuries at a cost of more than $1.1B. Fewer than 50% of patients report satisfactory functional
 3 recovery following nerve injury repair procedures, likely due to slow axonal regrowth and difficulty in bridging
 4 across the sites of injury due to inflammation, scarring, and axonal misdirection. Poor recovery from nerve injuries
 5 leads to significant impacts on patient quality of life. For example, motor and/or sensory impairment from nerve
 6 injuries can prevent patients from performing basic daily activities, can be accompanied by chronic pain, and
 7 result in severe psychosocial impacts. Injuries to proximal segments and gaps > 1 cm are challenging and have
 8 inconsistent outcomes, while gaps larger than 3 cm seldom achieve any meaningful recovery. A number of
 9 products used for nerve gap injury repair such as conduits and allografts exist; however, none has shown
10 compelling clinical improvements in functional outcomes, particularly when compared to the “gold standard”
11 autograft. Renerva has developed Peripheral Nerve Matrix (PNM), a tissue-based hydrogel derived from porcine
12 nerve that can be used as a nerve conduit filler for the purpose of improving functional outcomes following the
13 repair of challenging gap injuries. PNM has been shown to modulate key early events in the nerve regeneration
14 process including macrophage recruitment, macrophage polarization towards a pro-regenerative/angiogenic
15 phenotype, and Schwann cell recruitment. In a sub-critical (0.8 cm) rodent nerve gap injury model, silicone
16 conduits filled with PNM were shown to increase axon extension (10x empty conduit control) and improve
17 functional recovery (compound motor action potential; 2x control), which was equivalent to the improvements
18 obtained using control autografts. While promising, PNM has yet to be tested in critical nerve gap defect models,
19 and additional optimization of the PNM formulation could yield results exceeding the performance of nerve
20 autografts. In this Phase I project, Renerva will optimize the PNM formulation (gel concentration and residual
21 chondroitin sulfate content) and mechanical properties (rheologic and compressive modulus) with the goal to
22 exceed the performance of the gold-standard nerve autograft in a rat critical nerve gap injury model (1.5 cm). An
23 established suite of longitudinal motor and sensory endpoints will be employed over a period of 12 weeks to
24 assess in vivo recovery. Electrophysiologic function as well as multiple histologic and immuno-labeling endpoints
25 will be performed at termination. Renerva will further test the shelf stability of the optimized PNM formulation via
26 in vitro and in vivo studies. The proposed objectives address critical requirements for regulatory and future clinical
27 use of PNM, and will critically de-risk PNM to enable Phase II of this project. Phase II will determine the optimized
28 PNM's ability to promote recovery in clinically relevant large gap injuries (>3 cm) in a large animal model and
29 support the completion of the safety tests required for commercializing the optimized PNM product. This project
30 will advance the field and allow clinicians to offer an effective product for critical size nerve gap injuries."

In collaboration with the Shelby County Health Department, which has jurisdiction over Memphis as well as
rural northwest Mississippi and Arkansas, we propose to inform policy decisions towards improving HIV
outcomes for population-level and subgroup-specific HIV goals in three diverse settings that together typify
high incidence locations in the U.S. HIV epidemic (New York City, Memphis, and northwest Mississippi).
We will use mathematical modeling to simulate alternative ways to distribute resources across interventions,
settings, and target populations to reduce HIV incidence and improve overall health. Our analyses will be
distinguished by incorporating screening and responding to CASM conditions (Conditions of Alcohol,
Substance and Mood), measures of inequality-aversion (i.e., willingness to trade-off some aggregate benefit in
order to distribute it more equally) towards vulnerable subgroups, and the promising new modalities of long-
acting-injectable PrEP and ART. Our partners at the Shelby County Health Department and their larger group
of stakeholders will provide context on local HIV infection patterns and feasibility and acceptability constraints
to inform modeling analyses."
11009178,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Significance: Young women account for 63% of all new HIV infections in sub-Saharan
Africa and are thus a high priority population for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Because adherence and
persistence to PrEP as oral emtricitabine/tenofovir have generally been low, new interventions are needed to
facilitate PrEP use. Injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) and the dapivirine vaginal ring, as well as choice of
adherence support, are promising approaches to increase PrEP use; however, a key remaining need is a
mechanism to effectively engage with young women over time. Intervention: PrEP My Way is a novel PrEP
delivery system based on Social Cognitive Theory involving clinic-based PrEP initiation, followed by peer-
delivered kits for HIV self-testing, PrEP refills, vaginal swabs for sexually transmitted infection (STI) self-
sampling, pregnancy tests, and family planning, if desired. Pilot research demonstrated high feasibility and
acceptability of PrEP My Way as an effective means to engage young women in care. PrEP use was modest
overall although improved compared to clinic-based delivery. When combined with choice of PrEP formulation
and adherence support tools, PrEP My Way is well positioned to create an optimized means to promote PrEP
use for young women in sub-Saharan Africa. Innovation: PrEP My Way is the first, to our knowledge, peer-
delivered kit for holistic sexual health services that enables choice of PrEP formulation and adherence support,
combining key complementary evidence-based approaches for promoting PrEP use among young women.
Approach: In Aim 1, we will augment PrEP My Way to include CAB-LA and the dapivirine vaginal ring, as well
as choice of peer-based adherence support (SMS, routine check-ins, or WhatsApp groups). In Aim 2, we will
conduct a type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial of PrEP My Way vs enhanced standard of care in Kisumu,
Kenya in 432 young women over 1 year. We will assess the intervention with and without STI testing to assess
the marginal impact of the most costly kit component beyond PrEP. Our primary outcome will be prevention-
effective PrEP persistence (i.e., continued use by those with ongoing HIV prevention needs) by documented
injection (CAB-LA) or drug levels (ring, oral) at Month 9. Secondary outcomes will be prevention-effective
persistence and adherence at other time points, STI testing, and use of family planning. We will also track
implementation, service, and participant metrics using the Proctor framework. In Aim 3, we will conduct cost
and cost-effectiveness analyses of the intervention with and without STI testing. Investigators/environment:
Our team has the critical expertise needed for the success of this proposal: PrEP adherence/persistence and
implementation science (Dr. Haberer), PrEP/sexual health service delivery (Dr. Bukusi), PrEP formulation and
adherence support choice (Dr. Ngure), cost-effectiveness analysis (Dr. Barnabas), and intervention design
(ARK Africa, Dr. Siegler). Future directions: The Kenya National AIDS/STD Control Program (Dr. Wafula) will
be involved with all stages of this proposal to facilitate rapid integration and scale-up should it prove effective."
11009197,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Thanks to the advent of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), life expectancy has dramatically increased in
people with HIV (PWH) and the spectrum of diseases related to HIV has shifted towards non-infectious chronic
illnesses including cardiopulmonary disorders. Pulmonary vascular disease (PVD) is amongst the most
devastating cardiovascular complications of HIV. However, the etiopathology of pulmonary vascular remodeling,
the critical structural alteration and pathological feature for PVD, has yet to be determined. Herein, we will test
whether HIV-derived proteins, which remain in circulation despite cART and well-controlled viremia, contribute
to the development of PVD. We provide novel exciting preliminary data in two mouse models of HIV supporting
a role for CD4+ T Cells, HIV-Tat, and Podocan-like protein 1 (Podnl1) in PVD. We demonstrate that expression
of HIV-derived proteins in Tg26 mice promotes PVD as shown by remodeled pulmonary arteries (PAs), increased
right ventricular systolic pressure and right ventricle hypertrophy, decreased pulmonary artery acceleration time
(PAAT) and ratio of PAAT/pulmonary ejection time, as well as increased circulating Interleukin-1α (IL-1α) levels
in male and female mice. We also report that these cardiopulmonary alterations are exacerbated with aging.
Remarkably, we show that bone marrow transplant (BMT) from Tg26 to wild type (WT) mice fully recapitulate
the cardiopulmonary phenotype of Tg26 mice, which supports a role for viral proteins derived from hematopoietic
cells in PVD. Using RNA Seq analysis, we identified a new marker of PVD, Podnl1. Its levels are increased in
the lungs of both intact and BMT Tg26 mice, but more importantly in the lungs of PWH on cART. We
demonstrated that overexpression of Podnl1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) increases collagen levels
and that of PCNA, a marker of cell proliferation. Using a newly developed “T cell- blood vessel” co-culture system,
we show that exposure of discarded human aorta and pulmonary artery specimens to Tg26 T cells elevate
Podnl1 expression. Remarkably, we report that HIV-Tat is the only viral protein detectable in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from PWH on cART and show that chronic treatment of mice with Tat
reproduces the cardiopulmonary complications of intact and BMT Tg26 mice. Strikingly, we provide preliminary
evidence of high IL-1α levels in PBMCs from PWH and found higher IL-1α levels in CD4+ than in CD8+ T cells
isolated from Tg26 mice. Together, these exciting and novel findings form the core hypothesis of this proposal
that CD4+ T Cells expressing Tat promote PVD via IL1α-induced, Podnl1-mediated pulmonary artery
remodeling. We will test this hypothesis in three aims. In aim 1, we will test whether HIV-encoded proteins
accelerate PVD via Podnl1-dependent mechanisms. In aim 2, we will investigate whether HIV-associated PVD
involves CD4+ T cell-mediated, IL-1α-induced PVD, while aim 3 will test the hypothesis that HIV-derived Tat
protein promotes Podnl1 production and mediates the development of HIV-PVD. We anticipate that this proposal
will lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for the prevention of HIV-associated PVD."
11009270,"Abstract
Sexual Minority Men (SMM), particularly SMM 18-34 years old are disproportionately affected by HIV in the
United States (U.S), accounting for 68% new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. Moreover, over half of new HIV
diagnosis among SMM were among those 18-34 years old. There are many effective ways to prevent HIV,
including daily oral PrEP. However, PrEP adherence rates among SMM consistently fall short of the optimal
adherence thresholds. Drug use, particularly methamphetamine use, is associated with PrEP nonadherence.
Engaging in safe sex (such as consistent condom use) is another effective HIV prevention method. Yet,
methamphetamine, often used by some SMM during sex, makes people less cautious and more likely to
engage in sexual risk behaviors (SRBs, e.g., condomless anal sex (CAS)) increasing the risk of HIV
transmission. Taken together, PrEP nonadherence, methamphetamine use and engaging in SRBs all represent
suboptimal choices that fit into the behavioral economic concepts of preferring immediate rewards over future
benefits (delayed discounting) and overvaluation of rewards (demand). Past studies indicate that people who
are not adherent to medications, those who use drugs and those who engage in SRBs often have high levels
of delayed discounting and demand. Therefore, an intervention targeting delayed discounting and demand may
also positively benefit PrEP nonadherence, methamphetamine use and SRBs. Episodic Future Thinking (EFT)
is a novel intervention that has shown promising results in improving delayed discounting, demand, substance
use, and medication adherence but has not been tested among SMM. The current project aims are to refine
(Aim 1) and assess (Aim 2) the feasibility and acceptability of EFT for improving delayed discounting, demand,
PrEP nonadherence, methamphetamine use, and SRBs among SMM. In Aim 1 (Phase 1), we will conduct
formative evaluation of the EFT by enrolling n=10 SMM with recent (i.e. in the past three months): PrEP
nonadherence, methamphetamine use and CAS (or recent STI diagnosis) to participate in semi-structured
interviews to solicit feedback and explore aspects of the intervention that need to be refined. In Aim 1 (Phase
2), we will use findings from Phase 1 to modify elements of the EFT, resulting in a refined EFT. In Aim 2, we will
conduct a six-month pilot randomized controlled trial comparing EFT versus a control condition (brief
information and supportive counseling) in a sample of 60 SMM, using a 1:1 randomization to each group. EFT
and control condition will be delivered on participants smartphone using an ecological momentary intervention
platform. Primary outcomes will be the feasibility, and acceptability of the EFT intervention, alongside
preliminary efficacy of the EFT on improving delayed discounting, demand, PrEP nonadherence,
methamphetamine use and SRBs. Findings from this study will provide preliminary data and lay the
groundwork for conducting a larger-scale (R01) trial to formally determine efficacy."
11018009,"Title: NRF transcription factors in Environmental Stress and Disease Intervention
PROJECT SUMMARY
 My broad research program includes in-depth mechanistic investigations of arsenic pathogenesis/NRF
signaling and the translation of basic mechanistic knowledge to preclinical drug development. Chronic
exposure to arsenic, an environmental contaminant that affects an estimated 160 million people worldwide, is a
global public health concern correlated with an increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, as well as
type II diabetes. However, a critical gap still exists in our knowledge concerning the precise pathologic
mechanisms of arsenic, and generation of viable therapeutic approaches. Over the past decade, my research
has revealed that dysregulation of the NRF2 signaling pathway is a key driver of arsenic-based pathologies.
 Accordingly, my overarching vision is to harness our body's defense systems—specifically the NRF2
response—to alleviate the damage or pathogenesis induced by arsenic. Transcription factor NRF2 controls the
cellular stress response following exposure to environmental insults. Since the discovery of the NRF2 pathway
in 1999, NRF2 has been viewed as a “good” transcription factor that protects against oxidative stress-related
diseases, including cancer, and controlled activation of NRF2 using NRF2-inducing compounds to prevent
cancer initiation is well recognized. However, in 2008 my lab unveiled the “dark side” of NRF2—uncontrolled
NRF2 activation is a driver of cancer progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. Furthermore, recent
unpublished work from my lab has indicated that prolonged upregulation of NRF2 may also contribute to the
diabetogenic effects of arsenic. Therefore, specific NRF2 inhibitors will be powerful probes for dissecting the
“dark side” role of NRF2 in disease. A big challenge in the field is that there are no NRF2-specific inhibitors
available despite the efforts made.
 Therefore, the key scientific questions that need to be addressed, and as such are the focus of this R35
proposal, include: (i) the molecular basis of diseases associated with arsenic exposure (focusing on lung
cancer and type II diabetes); (ii) the effects of environmental stress on the NRF2 signaling network; (iii) the
ways by which we can harness the NRF2 response to improve human health; and (iv) the distinct roles of the
cap'n'collar (CNC) family members NRF1, NRF2, and NRF3. My lab will pursue answers to these questions
through innovative and rigorous experimental approaches, which will allow us to fill current gaps, advance
environmental health research, and ultimately improve human health."
11020022,"Hospital Variations in Postpartum Care Access, Quality, and Outcome: The Intersectionality of
Residence Location and Race/Ethnicity
Summary
The United States (U.S.) is amid a maternal health crisis, with increasing postpartum readmissions (PPR)
and maternal mental and substance use disorders. Rural and racial disparities in these postpartum care and
health outcomes especially persistent in the Southern U.S.. Most importantly, South Carolina (SC) ranked top
7th for the highest maternal mortality rate in the U.S.. In such a rural state where nearly 30% of reproductive-
age women were Black population and where racial inequities in adverse maternal outcomes have been
unacceptably persistent, the need to improving postpartum health outcomes is acute. Yet, addressing the
increase in PPR requires a localized holistic approach that encompasses improved preconception, antenatal,
and perinatal care to reduce healthcare disparities. Our primary goal is to quantify hospital variations
in postpartum health and health care inequities in racial underrepresented and rural
postpartum women. We will analyze >300,000 childbirths in SC from 2018-2023 by leveraging statewide
population-based vital records and hospital-based inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department records
from preconception, pregnancy, through 12 months postpartum. These data will also be linked to hospital
surveys for a variety of hospital factors. The aims of our study are to: Aim 1: Investigate the intersections of
residential rurality and race/ethnicity on the postpartum care access, quality, and outcomes throughout 1-year
post-birth. Aim 2: Examine the roles of hospital attributes (obstetric patient race/ethnicity mix, perinatal care
level [Level I-IV], obstetric workforce models [obstetricians, family physicians, and/or nurse midwives],
annual delivery volume) play on health inequities in postpartum outcomes. The proposed research is
significant by identifying hospital factors for postpartum inequities, to inform targeted sustainable practice
and policies for the improvement of maternal health and elimination of rural and racial/ethnic inequities at
hospital maternity care settings. It builds on our multidisciplinary research team from U01HD110062 and
3R01AI127203-05S2 with extensive experience in 1) rurality and race/ethnicity, 2) social and structural
determinants of health, 3) perinatal care equity, 4) mental health and substance use disorder, and 5) health
behaviors. This research is innovative in leveraging population-based all-payer healthcare records-vital
statistics linkage data that captures underrepresented and underserved perinatal populations that were often
underreported in health care claims data from preconception, pregnancy, intrapartum, through 12-month
postpartum, allowing us to identify postpartum inequities resulting from different perinatal periods.
Considering striking racial disparities in postpartum outcomes, racially diverse population, and historical
systemic racism in SC, the results will highlight opportunities for improvement in postpartum discharge
planning especially for marginalized people who are at highest risk of adverse postpartum outcomes."
11020053,"Project Summary/Abstract
Depression is a common, serious form of psychopathology that is associated with suffering, disability, and
suicide. Young people who identify as sexual or gender minority (SGM) are at strikingly high risk for
experiencing depression, putatively because of their experience of SGM-specific stress. Yet the mechanisms of
the association between stress and depression in SGM youth have been relatively neglected, with studies to
date limited by cross-sectional designs and a lack of focus on clinical neuroscience.
Depression is characterized by disrupted reward function and typically begins during adolescence, a key
developmental period for change in neurobehavioral systems supporting reward. The dopamine (DA)
neuromodulatory system is consistently associated with depression, considered a mediator of stress-depression
associations through the influence of inflammation, and thought to be specifically influential for anhedonia, a
cardinal symptom of depression that involves difficulty with motivation for or enjoyment of pleasant
experiences. Understanding the role of DA in depression requires examining reward function over time and
across domains, including frontostriatal reward circuitry, dopamine availability, reward-driven behavior, and
reward-focused experiences in real-life settings.
The proposed supplement activities will contribute to the parent R01 by examining associations of SGM
identity and related stress with (1) depression/anhedonia and (2) reward function (e.g., DA availability,
frontostriatal circuitry, behavior, real-life experience, and phone sensor-based movement). Exploratory work
will investigate the exacerbating or buffering role, respectively, of SGM-related stress and protective factors.
This work will contribute to the aims of the current, R01-funded DRIVE Study (MH127014), which uses a
translational clinical neuroscience approach to examine associations between depression and DA. In addition
to enrolling a new sample of 35 SGM youth with depression and varying in SGM-specific stress, the proposed
activities include adding rigorous measures of SGM identity and related stressors and protective factors to the
original R01 and administering DRIVE procedures and a 6-month follow-up visit to new SGM participants.
Methods include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess DA function (striatal tissue iron, brainstem
neuromelanin) and frontostriatal circuit function; ecological momentary assessment of reward processing and
reward-seeking behavior; smartphone-based passive sensing of motor activity; behavioral reward tasks; self-
report of depression, anhedonia, and reward function; and blood draw and assay for measurement of
circulating inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, IL-6). Findings will have relevance to the course and treatment of
depression and will increase the impact of the parent R01 while elucidating a pathway toward disparities."
11020835,"Summary
The objective of this grant is to develop a fully automated, Electronic Health Record (EHR)-integrable software
application, “DR-SCRN”, to improve patient’s compliance to diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening; by predicting
a patient’s risk of DR based on the analysis of patient’s own health data, and educating the patient as well as
notifying the provider of the patient’s DR risk and screening needs. DR-SCRN will analyze the readily available
health data of patient from EHR to identify and predict a trend of DR risk over next 3 years. The core innovations
of this project are: a) demonstrate a fully automated and EHR-integrated tool to predict patient’s DR risk. b)
improve screening compliance by educating the patient with visual and numerical data, c) calculate DR risk
based on patient’s health data, readily available from EHR, d) develop software to notify the provider of patient’s
screening needs and to assist with planning of the recommended screening schedule.
The main motivation for DR-SCRN is to improve patient’s compliance to DR screening by predicting their DR
risk using their own health data and making themselves and their care-provider aware of the potential risks. DR
is preventable with early detection through periodic screening and timely intervention. Although DR screening
examinations are readily available, only 18 to 40% of diabetics undergo the recommended annual eye exam. Low
compliance to DR screening results in vision loss and a $4.3 billion burden to the US due to vision loss treatment,
surgery, and diminished productivity. Low compliance results from patient’s ignorance, financial constraints,
lack of access, and lack of symptoms or knowledge that vision loss was associated with diabetes. Patient’s
ignorance and lack of knowledge have been the most common barriers even when others are minimized. DR-
SCRN attempts to improve the compliance by promoting the education of patients and providers on health
condition and potential risks and providing a seamless system for both patients and providers to make the
screening examinations easily accessible to the population in need.
The objectives of this project will be accomplished through three specific aims. In aim 1, we will develop an
automatic algorithm to calculate DR risk based on patient’s health data, using a retrospective dataset of N=5000
diabetic patients selected from VisionQuest’s proprietary retinal screening database. In aim 2, we will develop
an extrapolation or trend estimation algorithm to predict future DR risk based current DR risk trend, using a
separate longitudinal database of N=2500 diabetic patients. In aim 3, we will develop educational material for
patients and providers to improve screening compliance, that provides: a) Numerical DR risk prediction over
next 3 years, b) Visual representation of how the DR risk may change, c) Proposed DR screening schedule.
Further in Phase II, we will pursue three objectives: (1) a large-scale, longitudinal DR screening clinical study,
(2) validation of the algorithms and software application using the clinical study data, (3) developing a bridging-
software to integrate DR-SCRN with an EHR system, to demonstrate a complete application prototype. Our
primary measure of success in Phase II will be the integration of DR-SCRN into the EHR of our existing network
of clinics in Mexico and at Retina Global, which are already using our automatic diabetic retinopathy screening
system."
11008902,"Project Summary Abstract
Objectives and Specific Aims: The overarching objective is to develop and validate a diagnostic tool for
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), Deep Learning-enhanced Transmembranous Electromyography (DL-tmEMG),
to enable convenient point-of-care, and accurate detection of OSA for widespread use by any practitioner
evaluating patients for OSA. In phase 1, this proposal aims to establish feasibility of tmEMG to diagnose OSA
patients with good accuracy and to optimize the DL algorithm. Phase 2 aims to demonstrate generalizability
and accuracy of DL-tmEMG in a diverse population, identifying differences in important subpopulations and the
benefits of multimodal data integration, while progressing regulatory approval.
Health-relatedness: This project addresses the urgent need for efficient and accurate diagnostics for OSA, a
widespread and serious disorder impacting an estimated 1 billion people worldwide, while undiagnosed OSA
costs the U.S. approximately $149.6 billion annually. Successful development of DL-tmEMG will enhance
personalized OSA management and improve healthcare accessibility. Efficient screening for OSA in under-
resourced areas and for patients pre-surgically and perinatally are relevant to this proposal.
Design: Phase 1 Study#1 (9 months) is a case-control observational feasibility study of 60 adult patients.
Phase 2 Study #2 (18 months) involves a large single center prospective observational cohort study of 200
adult patients referred for PSG testing at the UCSD Sleep Center.
Methods: DL-tmEMG is a new diagnostic that incorporates two novel technologies: 1) a non-invasive
transmembranous sensor of muscle activity (tmEMG), and 2) deep learning algorithms applied to EMG signal
to provide an automatic interpretation (EMGNet). The combination of these two innovations obviates the need
for an expert electromyographer, key to allowing for widespread use to fulfill the unmet need for improved
diagnostics in OSA. In Phase 1 Study #1, 30 healthy and 30 patients with moderate to severe OSA will
undergo DL-tmEMG within 30 days of polysomnography. We will compare DL-tmEMG classification results
with PSG results and calculate performance metrics. Phase 2 Study #2 utilizes a similar methodology as
Study #1 but differs in size as well as population pretest probabilities, being a cohort study design. Patients will
undergo DL-tmEMG within 30 days of PSG, which will classify patients as OSA (AHI>5) or non-OSA (AHI<5).
The performance of DL-tmEMG will again be compared with PSG results. Recruitment will be adjusted to allow
performance to be evaluated in important sub-populations.
Results of this prospective study will provide strong evidence for validity and reliability of DL-tmEMG as a novel
diagnostic tool for OSA and will be used to support a multicenter study (a phase IIB proposal) that will further
evaluate the performance of DL-tmEMG across sites and diverse patient populations to meet FDA submission
requirements, as part of a 510(k) premarket notification or a premarket approval (PMA) process."
11008046,"PROJECT Summary: The Chiron Project: Using Virtual Reality to Prevent Substance Use
Disorder in Healthcare Workers Facing Burnout
Stress and burnout at the workplace are associated with increases in substance abuse and
alcohol consumption, and the healthcare setting has been widely studied as an example of a
field with exceptional rates of burnout and workplace stress. Astonishingly, nearly 50% of
physicians and 62% of nurses in the US are affected by burnout. Despite the magnitude of this
problem, fully 2/3 of physicians report no access to workplace services offering relief from
overwhelming stress and burnout in part due to burnout-related stigma. It is indeed worrisome
that options to serve those in need are few and the cost of clinicians leaving the healthcare field
is estimated at $990K per physician exit and $4.6B per year. To address the worsening
epidemic of workplace stress and burnout in healthcare settings, See Yourself Health proposes
to develop The Chiron Project workspace platform, an immersive virtual care and collaboration
workspace access with mobile devices or VR headsets that enables health professionals group
educational programs to master self-compassion, resilience and self-management skills, access
confidential peer support, and receive timely evidence-based care to better cope with burnout
and avoidance of alcohol and substance use disorders. Phase I Project Goal: We aim to assess
the feasibility and usability of The Chiron Project. Specific Aim 1: To build the SYH immersive
world platform to address workplace stress and burnout using virtual reality and WebXR gaming
technology with telehealth capabilities and tailored educational content in mindful self-
compassion. Specific Aim 2: To test the usability of The Chiron Project platform using Rapid
Iterative Testing and Evaluation (RITE) with 30 health professionals. Specific Aim 3: To test the
feasibility of using The Chiron Project for health professionals over a 2-week period in a real-life
setting. Plan for Phase II: We aim to assess the comparative effectiveness and implementation
potential of the Chiron Project platform in a fully powered hybrid clinical trial."

Rotator cuff tears are the most common tendon injury observed in adults. The risk for rotator cuff injury
significantly increases with age, affecting approximately 25% of the population older than 60 years and 60% of
those over the age of 80 years old. Currently, the standard of care for most rotator cuff tears is arthroscopic
surgical repair, with nearly 500,000 of these procedures performed annually in the United States and direct costs
of over $7 billion per year. Rotator cuff repair (RCR) outcomes are dependent upon successful rehabilitation,
with proper healing and functional recovery of the rotator cuff following surgical repair substantially decreasing
the high incidence of retears. Healing and recovery after RCR are dependent upon strict adherence to a delicate
rehabilitation process during which the repaired tendon must be unloaded by carefully performing controlled
movements that do not inadvertently activate contraction of the shoulder muscles. The complexity of these
movements can make it challenging for patients to maintain compliance during rehabilitation, and thus require
extensive guidance on movements during rehabilitation following RCR to reduce the risk of repair failure and
retear. There exists a clear need for the development of technologies that provide continuous, real-time guidance
to patients during rehabilitation following RCR and enable the continuous and efficient integration of valuable
patient-specific data into the design of custom rehabilitation programs. This Phase II SBIR application will build
upon promising outcomes from Active4D’s funded SBIR Phase I project which resulted in the successful design
of a wearable biofeedback system – the MyoGuard system - and demonstrated the accuracy and reproducibility
of its continuous monitoring and biofeedback of muscle activity and joint angle. The goal of the MyoGuard system
is to expedite patient return to normal activity and prevent retears following rotator cuff repair by enabling
increased patient compliance with rehabilitation exercises and improving the customization of care. This Phase
II SBIR project will focus on preparations for the commercialization of the MyoGuard system. In Aim 1, we will
optimize the design of the MyoGuard system for scalable manufacturing and increase the accessibility of the
MyoGuard phone application to better facilitate independent use of the device. In Aim 2, we will conduct human
subjects research to obtain normative activity data and evaluate human factors, including ease of use and patient
compliance. The successful completion of this SBIR Phase II project will provide strong baseline evidence to
support decision-making and the design for our future Phase I clinical trial that will test the efficacy of the
MyoGuard system in reducing complications, particularly retears, following rotator cuff repair. These key data
will ultimately allow us to seek 510K FDA regulatory approval and support rapid commercialization and
deployment of this product, accelerating recovery and improving outcomes for the more than 500,000 patients
undergoing rotator cuff repairs every year in the United States."
10804717,"Project Summary
The Georgia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Project is a statewide,
ongoing population‐based survey that collects information on women with a recent live birth in
Georgia. Georgia PRAMS initiated sampling with January 1993 births. PRAMS survey data
complements Vital Records data by collecting information about mothers’ attitudes, behaviors,
and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. Survey topics include
preconception health, pregnancy intention, prenatal care, health insurance, oral health during
pregnancy, substance use, breastfeeding, safe sleep behaviors and environment, intimate
partner violence, maternal stressors, contraception use and methods, and supplemental topics
as emergent public health issues arise (ex: Zika Virus, Coronavirus Disease 2019), among
others. Each month, a stratified random sample of approximately 110 women is drawn from
birth certificate records accessed through the State Office of Vital Records. The current
stratification variable is preterm birth (gestational age greater than 20 and less than 37 weeks
versus all other births). The stratification scheme can vary by year and is used to ensure
adequate representation of key subgroups in the sample. Sampled PRAMS participants are
surveyed two to six months after delivery of their infant first by mail and then by phone if a mail
survey response is not received. Each mother’s survey is linked to her infant’s birth certificate.
The goal of the Georgia PRAMS Project is to provide population-based data on maternal
experiences and behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy and during early infancy which
can be used to reduce the risk of adverse birth outcomes and improve the health of mothers
and infants in Georgia. Georgia PRAMS is the only data source for many key indicators of
maternal and child health in the state, providing essential data to identify disparities, select
maternal and child health priorities, inform and evaluate programs, and inform policy changes to
improve the health of all mothers and infants in Georgia."

This is a request for a continuation of the Biostatistics and Epidemiology in AIDS Training Program at the
Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). The program prepares predoctoral and postdoctoral
trainees in the application of biostatistics and epidemiology to HIV research, and the development of new
methodology relevant to this research. The program is an active collaboration between the HSPH
Departments of Biostatistics and Epidemiology. Trainees receive high-quality instruction in core biostatistical
theory and methods, such as probability, statistical inference, computing and data analysis. The program
also provides training in specialized topics of particular relevance for HIV applications, such as survival
analysis, longitudinal and multivariate data analysis, causal inference, and genetics, with options in the
increasingly important areas of computational biology/bioinformatics and health data science.
The training also includes substantive course work in HIV-related topics, most commonly in HIV
epidemiology; topics in immunology, virology and infectious diseases; or HIV-related health policy. Trainees
participate in a collaborative HIV-related project with clinical and laboratory science researchers; a regular
“HIV Working Group” seminar series where faculty, trainees and other researchers present their HIV-related
research; and seminar discussions about the design of developing clinical trials and observational studies in
HIV research organized by the HSPH Center for Biostatistics in AIDS Research (CBAR). An important focus
of training is the opportunity to work with faculty on HIV-related biostatistical and epidemiological methods
research including, for predoctoral students, the development of a doctoral thesis. Trainees participate in
formal courses on scientific integrity in the conduct of research and reproducibility of research, and
workshops on effective writing, public speaking, and career development.
Since its inception in 1988, this training program has emphasized strong links to HIV research, particularly
through the large statistical centers at CBAR working with international HIV clinical trials research networks
and the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study, and through collaborations with the Botswana Harvard Health
Partnership and other sub-Saharan HIV-related projects. The Program has a particular focus on supporting
a pipeline of applicants from underrepresented minority groups and their success in completion of training.
The focus on interdisciplinary training at HSPH, as well as its talented and diverse student body and faculty,
makes it well suited for a training program in biostatistics and epidemiology applied to HIV research."
11022589,"PROPOSED PROJECT ABSTRACT
Immigration can be a traumatic experience, and it is well documented that exposure to trauma negatively
impacts the mental health and well-being of Latinx immigrants. Specifically, exposure to immigration-related
exposures such as violence and detention during immigration, can result in post-traumatic stress, depression,
and anxiety. Studies show that exposure to immigration-related trauma as well as high levels of acculturative
stress are associated with psychological distress and PTSD. Specifically, 1st generation Mexican immigrants
often experience psychological distress, as evident in suicide behaviors and depression and stress related to
undocumented status. Second generation Mexican immigrants also experience discrimination and financial
stressors. All these stressors make it imperative to have equitable access to mental health services for this
population. While valuable research is available at national level to indicate that both 1st and 2nd generation
Mexican immigrants experience mental health challenges and are less likely than white Americans to seek
treatment due to related stigma and lack of health insurance, one shortcoming of this literature is lack of state-
specific data. This is important because Latinx’s immigration settlement patterns across the US have varied,
with North Carolina (NC) seeing a significant increase to more than a million in the past decade, of which 54%
identify of Mexican decent. The overall objective of this supplemental application is to collect data from the
participants in the parent award to better understand the challenges and barriers that 1st and 2nd Mexican
immigrants living in NC experience when needing and seeking mental health services. This supplement will
also support the candidate’s training goals regarding conducting qualitative interviews, quantitative data
collection, and data dissemination (manuscripts and conference presentations). The candidate will achieve this
by analyzing data from questionnaires regarding mental health access, needs and challenges, and in-depth,
semi-structured interviews. This data will enable us to address the following specific aims: (1) Assess and
compare the type of mental health care services sought and utilized, as well as challenges and barriers to
obtaining those services among 1st and 2nd generation Mexican immigrants (N=200), and (2) Delineate the
barriers, challenges, and needs associated with seeking and utilizing mental health care as well as the factors
contributing to successes with help seeking among 1st and 2nd generation Mexican immigrants (N=45).The
proposed work is expected to have a positive impact because it will bridge the gap in the literature for region-
specific data on the mental health needs and barriers experienced by 1st and 2nd generation Mexican
immigrants."

11014853,"ABSTRACT
 Thyroid cancer is less frequent but deadlier for individuals who self-identify as African American/ Black or
Latino/Hispanic in comparison to individuals who self-identify as White/European American. Thyroid cancer
mortality in individuals who self-identify as Hispanic is higher than in individuals who self-identify as
White/European American. At the same time, thyroid cancer patients who self-identify as African American/
Black are associated with worse overall survival than patients who self-identify as White/European Americans.
There are many reasons for these disparities in survival and mortality including lack of insurance, poor access
to care, and low quality of health care; however, there is emerging evidence that biology may also play a role.
In our funded R01, we aim to validate the DNA methylation panel with 373 biomarkers to improve pre-operative
early detection of thyroid cancer. This does not include genetic ancestry. To date, we have obtained 779 of
4550 thyroid biopsies from six highly diverse centers; 100 biopsies are from individuals who self-identify as
non-Hispanic White, and 49 from individuals who self-identify as African American/Black. Here we aim to
perform a comprehensive gene expression and DNA methylation analysis of thyroid nodules from individuals
who self-identify as non-Hispanic White or African American/Black and compare with individuals who self-
identify as non-Hispanic White and test for race-specific differences. The analysis will be done based on
genetic ancestry.
 Our goal is to identify race-specific differences in gene expression and DNA methylation to better
understand disparities in thyroid cancer mortality and survival. We plan to accomplish our overall objective for
this project by pursuing the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Analysis of race-specific transcriptional activity in benign and malignant nodules from Hispanic
Whites, African Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites.
 Aim 2: Analysis of race-specific DNA methylation in benign and malignant nodules from Hispanic Whites,
African Americans, and non-Hispanic Whites and alignment of these data with race-specific gene expression.
 This proposal addresses two important cancer disparity questions: the role of gene activity, and the role of
epigenetic changes in thyroid cancer disparities, respectively. By elucidating biological mechanisms driving
thyroid cancer disparities, our study has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with thyroid
cancer disparities and promote health equity."

Alzheimer’s disease is devastating for individuals and society. Impaired learning and memory,
particularly in the context of spatial navigation, is one of its early and major symptoms. Similarly,
rodents recapitulating aspects of Alzheimer’s disease also exhibit early impairments in spatial
navigation. A preponderance of evidence suggests abnormal cortical-hippocampal
communication in humans with Alzheimer’s disease. Hippocampal-cortical interactions during sleep
are thought to be critical for consolidation of newly acquired memories. However, no studies have
assessed these brain dynamics during sleep in rodents modeling Tau and amyloid beta
(Aβ) aggregation aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, the proposed research will explore the
functionality of brain dynamics during sleep in the hippocampal-PC network in animal models of
Tau and Aβ aggregation (TAβA). To do this, we will use a triple transgenic mouse where three
major genes associated with familial Alzheimer’s disease are expressed leading to TAβA. This
mouse model mimics plaque and tangle pathological hallmarks of the disease, with a distribution
pattern similar to human patients, including synaptic changes in the limbic system. In addition, all
findings will be confirmed in a transgenic rat with Aβ accumulation, plaque formation, tau
accumulation, cell loss, and spatial memory impairments. Specifically, we will: 1) assess the
relationship between spatial learning and memory, as well as brain dynamics during sleep, both
within and across the hippocampus and cortex; 2) use a novel targeted optogenetic approach
to functionally dissect the relative contributions of TAβA in the hippocampus to impaired
hippocampal-cortical coupling during sleep and impaired spatial learning. 3) test the efficacy of
a non-invasive visual stimulation approach, known for clearing cortical TAβA, to relieve
impaired hippocampal-cortical coupling during sleep and impaired spatial learning. This project
will provide insight into the normal function of a circuit that is dysfunctional in Alzheimer’s disease
and allow us to probe dysfunction in this circuit that emerges in very early stages of disease
progression in rodents modeling TAβA aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. This research will allow
us to begin understanding changes in this network which may underlie the emergence of cognitive
impairments observed in Alzheimer’s disease and begin testing the efficacy of a non-invasive
treatment for reversing the functional brain abnormalities and impaired cognition."
11022976,"Project Summary. Project 1: Longevity Association Contexts, Trajectories and Predictions
Understanding the multifactorial nature of human longevity and aging-related outcomes is crucial for advancing
geriatric research and optimizing healthspan. Large-scale genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies have
identified numerous biomarkers related to age-associated diseases and longevity. However, the influence of
sex, genetic diversity, and environmental factors on the predictive value of these biomarkers remains
underexplored, particularly in the context of diverse populations. Project 1 (P1) of the Longevity Consortium
(LC) seeks to utilize robust integrated approaches to evaluate the mechanistic underpinnings of the predictive
relationships between biologic factors and aging-related outcomes, their context dependence, and their
relevance to longevity and healthspan separately from the reflection of age, thus addressing Objective 1 of the
RFA. P1 will develop and implement a combination of harmonization schemes, statistical analyses, and
machine learning techniques in collaboration with other Projects and the Integrative Analysis Core (IAC)
through these major activities: 1. Expand the harmonized LC legacy data to include genomics, longitudinal
health assessments and chronic condition diagnoses, as well as updated mortality information by utilizing the
NIA-LINKAGE program along with data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). 2.
Characterize the context-dependency (e.g., sex and genetic background) of the association of factors with
longevity and age-related health trajectories. 3. Access additional relevant data sets, including the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS), Arivale study, Young Finns Study (YFS), Danish Health Registry (DHS), UK Biobank
(UKB), and Study of Muscle, Mobility and Aging (SOMMA) to expand the legacy LC studies and generalize the
findings to more diverse populations. We will endeavor to harmonize data across studies as possible, and/or
collaborate with international cohort curators on validation studies. 4. Develop and apply methods to build
multicomponent predictive models of longevity, aging trajectories and other age-related phenotypes. 5. Assess
the performance and utility of the models in different contexts and populations. As a key component of the
highly integrated Longevity Consortium, P1 will participate in the exchange and assessment of newly
discovered longevity-related factors, variants and/or signatures and determine the nature of their associations
with longevity phenotypes, aging trajectories or health decline (frailty). These integrated activities will enable
the ultimate goal of LC, which is to identify and develop drug targets, biomarkers, and predictive models of
longevity and assess their translational potential."
11022979,"Project Summary: P4
The goal of P4 is to improve our ability to discover “geroprotectors,” i.e. drugs that can slow aging and extend
lifespan by postponing age-dependent changes that impair health and lead to death. The plan makes use of
new ideas and methods in complementary in silico and in experimental approaches. The chemoinformatics
group headed by Thomas Girke will develop and use strategies for identifying drugs and targets likely to show
effects on aging and and age-dependent declines, based on LC research and data in the public domain (Aim
1). The second team, headed by Richard Miller, will evaluate candidate geroprotectors in mice (Aim 2), and in
exploratory studies in humans (Aim 3) and dogs (Aim 4). The plan for mouse work is based on the concept of
“Aging Rate Indicators (ARI),” defined as molecular tests that discriminate slow-aging animals from normal
controls. Unlike the familiar “biomarkers of aging,” which are surrogates for biological age and interpretable
only if tested at multiple ages in older subjects, ARIs are surrogates for the rate of aging. They can therefore
be evaluated at a single time point, even in young and middle-aged individuals. Past LC work has discovered a
set of ARIs, measured in plasma, fat, muscle, liver, and brain, that are altered significantly in 10 different
varieties of slow-aging mice, including four in which aging was slowed by anti-aging drugs. Aim 2a will refine
the ARI battery using tissue samples from 40 drugs for which lifespan effects will be known by Year 2 of the
proposed award, to improve the set of ARI assays that discriminate effective from ineffective candidate
geroprotectors. Aim 2b will use known geroprotectors to document the time course over which ARIs change
after drug exposure. Aim 2c, the heart of P4, will then evaluate the candidate geroprotectors selected under
Aim 1 using the optimized test conditions developed in Aim 2b, to see which ones resemble authentic anti-
aging drugs in their ability to alter ARIs. The results of Aim 2c will help us validate and improve the selection
algorithms of Aim 1 in an iterative, reciprocal process involving both lab teams. Aim 2d extends these concepts
to normal mice, to test the predictions that ARIs can identify adult mice destined (a) for long lifespan; and (b)
for preservation of cognitive ability at older ages. Aim 2d will also include plasma metabolomic data and
extensive analysis of brain histochemistry to test a range of inter-related hypotheses. Aim 3 will evaluate
plasma ARIs and fat/muscle mRNA data obtained from healthy human septuagenarians, to see if ARIs can
discriminate subjects with unusually good preservation of youthful abilities. Aim 4 will conduct similar analyses
on plasma of dogs involved in the Dog Aging Project. Anticipated outcomes of P4 include (a) a list of candidate
geroprotectors that deserve testing in mouse lifespan protocols and in human and mouse disease models; (b)
optimized in silico methods for nominating promising anti-aging drugs; (c) a validated test battery that can be
used in future work for short-term assessment of proposed geroprotectors in mice; and (d) initial attempts to
translate the mouse findings for research on a second mammalian model (dogs), and in humans."
11023751,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Plasma concentrations of biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are strongly
correlated with their levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and with amyloid and tau burden in the brain on
PET scans. Not surprisingly they have also been found to correlate with cognitive functioning in older adults,
raising the possibility of early identification of sub-clinical ADRD pathology in midlife, and early intervention to
stave off ADRD before potentially irreversible damage has set in. The midlife has a demonstrably huge
influence on old age health and functioning, and cognitive function starts declining from peak levels in midlife.
At least 2 studies have indeed found that blood-based biomarkers in midlife are associated with impaired
cognition decades later, but it is not known if these biomarkers can predict who declines early and whether
midlife changes in biomarkers impact future trajectories of cognitive functioning. Other open questions are
whether there are Black-White differences in the strength of the association between blood-based ADRD
biomarkers and measured cognition in midlife, and whether there are synergies between vascular risk and
ADRD biomarkers in midlife. Race modification of associations with cognition and synergy with vascular risk
are both seen with CSF-based biomarkers in older adults; whether these translate to blood-based biomarkers
in midlife is not known. Accordingly, the objectives of this administrative supplement to the SWAN Aging U19
are to 1) quantify midlife change in plasma concentrations of the ratio of Aβ1-42 to Aβ1-40, neurofilament light
chain (NFL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and pTau181 and serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) from the 12th follow up SWAN visit (V12; median age 60) to 15th follow up (V15; median age
65); 2) estimate the association of these biomarkers (and 5-year within-woman change in biomarkers) with
concurrently measured performance (and V12-to-V15 change in performance) on tests of cognitive processing
speed, episodic memory, and working memory; 3) estimate Black-White differences in biomarker levels in
midlife women, and if present, the degree to which they explain racial disparities in cognitive processing speed
and memory and their rates of decline; and 4) explore whether the associations of blood-based biomarkers
with scores on tests of cognition are modified by a) race (Black vs. White) and b) cardiovascular risk."
11009095,"Abstract
Microglia (Mg), the brain residential macrophage, play critical roles in maintaining adult brain homeostasis. Mg
can function as multi-players such as housekeepers, guards, and warriors under both physiological and
pathological conditions. Accumulating evidence reveal that Mg also play vital roles in brain aging. Reversing or
eliminating senescent Mg and replenishing with new-born Mg have been suggested as treatment for aging and
neurodegenerative disease. Recently, Mg depletion and repopulation (MgDR) has been tested as a potential
therapeutic approach for acute brain injury and Alzheimer’s diseases. Mechanically, the repopulated Mg show
homeostatic phenotype with restoring BDNF signaling or increasing the activity of IL6 pathway to improve brain
functions. It has been well-accepted that sustained and lower levels of Mg activation promote Mg senescence
and contribute to HAND pathogenesis. Several anti-neuroinflammatory drugs have been proposed as alternative
approach for HAND therapy. However, whether MgDR could be a novel therapeutic approach to mitigate
neurological deficiency in chronic HIV (+) individuals have never been explored. We initiated pilot studies and
obtained these preliminary data: (1) Both HIV transgenic (Tg) rats and HIV-inducible (i) mice show increased
LDAM in the brains compared to age-matched counterparts; (2) HIV-iTAT mice show dysregulated lipid profile
in the brain hippocampus; (3) MgDR by PLX3397 restored locomotion coordination ability in HIV-iTAT male mice.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that LDAM contribute to the pathogenesis of HAND and
neuropsychiatric symptoms and MgDR can exert therapeutic effects on brain dysfunctions in the context of
chronic HIV infection. The hypothesis will be tested in the following two specific aims (SA): SA1: Investigate the
effects of MgDR on HAND and neuropsychiatric symptoms in HIV-Tg26 mice. SA2: Explore the detailed
mechanisms underlying the effects of MgDR on brain pathology in vivo. This proposal will explore the therapeutic
effects of MgDR on brain pathology in the context of chronic HIV infection. If succeed, we could open a new
research direction to identify effective therapy to improve the life-quality of chronic HIV (+) individuals."
11009104,"PROJECT SUMMARY
What is the shortest path from the human antibody repertoire to sera that protects from an HIV-1 challenge?
We propose here that this pathway starts from B-cell receptors (BCRs) with long, tyrosine-sulfated heavy-
chain CDR3s (HCDR3s) encoded by D3-family of diversity (D) chain segments. This path ends with broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting the V2-glycan or ‘apex’ epitope of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein
(Env). That is, the most direct way to prevent many HIV-1 transmission events through conventional
vaccination is to induce a defined subset of circulating HCDR3s to bind the Env apex.
This hypothesis is supported by several observations: (1) Apex bnAbs do not require extensive or rare
hypermutations. (2) Neutralization by key apex bnAbs, notably those of the PG9/PG16 and VRC26 families,
is largely mediated by their HCDR3 regions. (3) These key bnAbs bind their distinct apex epitopes through
HCDR3 encoded by long (>24 amino-acid), tyrosine-sulfated D3-family diversity (D) segments, specifically
via ‘YYDF’ motifs encoded by the D3-3 segment. (4) BCR bearing HCDR3 with these properties are present
in humans at a frequency of 1 in 2000, far more frequently than other proposed bnAb precursors. Further, (5)
when we introduced with CRISPR/Cas12a only the HCDR3s of PG16 and VRC26.25 into a diverse population
of murine BCRs, B cells encoding these chimeric BCRs affinity matured and generated potent neutralizing
sera in recipient mice immunized with trimeric Env (SOSIP-TM) antigens. (6) When we similarly edited murine
B cells to express the HCDR3 of the VRC26-family unmutated common ancestor (UCA), they similarly affinity
matured and generated potent neutralizing sera in recipient mice. Finally, as we show here, (7) SOSIP-TM
proteins can be modified to bind common D3-3-encoded HCDR3 from HIV-negative persons while continuing
to engage mature apex bnAbs. In summary, potential apex-bnAb precursors with long D3-family HCDR3 are
common, these precursors can bind SOSIP-TM variants with unmodified apex epitopes, and they can affinity
mature in response to SOSIP-TM antigens in wild-type mice engrafted with human HCDR3-edited B cells.
Our goals then are to refine our definition of accessible apex bnAb precursors found frequently in uninfected
persons, and to identify sets of SOSIP-TM antigens that affinity mature these precursors so that they generate
polyclonal sera and monoclonal bnAbs that protect from multiple HIV-1 isolates. To do so, we will use our
useful variant of mammalian display technology (Yin et al., PNAS 2021) and our novel mouse models for
vaccine evaluation (He, Ou et al., Immunity 2023; Yin et al., Nat Biomed Eng, 2024). These models rely on
our ability to introduce human HCDR3, or whole human antibodies, directly into their appropriate VDJ (VJ)-
recombined loci of murine B cells, and then affinity mature the resulting BCR chimeras in vivo.
Collectively, these studies will determine the best antigens and vaccination strategies to generate apex bnAbs
in uninfected persons. In doing so, they will complement parallel efforts to elicit other classes of bnAbs."

HIV disproportionately impacts Latino sexual minority men (SMM), particularly youth and young adults. HIV
incidence in young Latino SMM is in part driven by low uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) due to
multilevel barriers. In my prior work, I led a community-driven media campaign entitled “PrEPárate” (“Be
PrEPared”) which promoted PrEP information and a website with affordable and bilingual options to access
PrEP. The campaign was associated with increased PrEP awareness and use but had limited reach to highly
marginalized young Latino SMM (e.g., those without insurance, those with limited English proficiency). In this
K23 career development award, I propose to develop, pilot, and evaluate a multilevel intervention that
combines a refined media campaign and peer-based strategy, informed by social network analysis. For youth
and young adults, social networks of peers and family are especially influential in decision making and present
an opportunity to promote PrEP among marginalized communities. Through this award, I will receive new
training and mentored experience in (1) social network analysis, (2) multilevel intervention development, and
(3) implementation science. This K23 will lay the groundwork for an R01 application to conduct a randomized
controlled trial studying the effectiveness of a multilevel intervention to increase PrEP use among young Latino
SMM. This proposal will advance understanding of how cultural and developmental factors shape young Latino
SMM social networks and also will help identify optimal strategies to address PrEP disparities for youth and
young adults. Through this training, I will gain the skills required to transition to independence as an
investigator with expertise in interventions to address HIV-related disparities among marginalized youth and
young adults."

Cardiac IKr is a critical repolarizing potassium current shaping the human ventricular action potential. It is
conducted by heteromeric assemblies of the human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG1) 1a and 1b subunits.
These subunits are encoded by alternate transcripts of the hERG/KCNH2 gene and differ only in their amino-
terminal regions. hERG1a/1b heteromerization is vital for normal CM function, as the imbalance of subunit
expression and/or function results in cellular pro-arrhythmic behaviors. hERG1a/1b assembly is mediated by
the co-translational association of the encoding mRNAs in HEK293 cells, cardiomyocytes derived from human
induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs), and human myocardium. Evidence suggests that interaction
between the nascent proteins is not required for the co-translational complex assembly. This grant's
preliminary findings indicate that this complex assembly occurs post-transcriptionally and is promoted by direct
interactions between hERG1a and 1b mRNAs governed by their secondary structures. In preliminary studies,
RNA binding proteins DDX3X and DDX5 were identified as part of the complex, and purified DDX3X promoted
hERG1a/1b mRNAs' association in vitro. In the K99 phase, I will define the mRNA structural features
promoting the co-translational association and determine the affinity and energies of the RNA/RNA interaction
using in vitro systems, isothermal calorimetry (ITC), mutagenesis, hybrid protein-RNA immunoprecipitation
(RIP), and live-cell imaging. I will also determine whether DDX3X and DDX5 affect hERG1a and 1b mRNAs
stability, translation, and association in hiPSC-CMs using qPCR, electrophysiology, Western Blot, ribosome
profiling, RIP, and single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH). I will use quantitative ITC and in
vitro reconstitution approaches to determine the specificity, affinity, and energies of the interaction between
purified DDX3X and DDX5 with hERG1a and 1b mRNAs. I will also evaluate if DDX3X and DDX5 promote the
association of the mRNAs in in vitro systems. In the R00 phase, I will determine whether the stability,
translation, and association of hERG1a and 1b mRNAs are impaired in arrhythmias associated with type 2 long
QT syndrome (LQT2). I will use hiPSC-CM disease models to evaluate half-life, translation rate, and
association of the mRNAs with qPCR, ribosome profiling, RIP, and smFISH. These experiments will contribute
to understanding ion channel biogenesis and elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying LQT2 related
arrhythmias. This proposal is designed to fulfill my short-term goals of expanding my skills in cardiovascular
research and biophysics and transitioning into the independent phase of my career. This will ultimately allow
me to obtain my long-term purpose of linking RNA and ion channel biophysics to translational cardiovascular
research."

Pancreatic cancer has a depressing 5-year survival rate estimated at 12%. The dismal outlook is
due to myriad issues, including the fact that patients are asymptomatic in early stages combined
with the lack of screening tools. One window to earlier detection is through pancreatic cystic
lesions detected incidentally in routine imaging analyses for diagnosis of unrelated disorders.
These patients are at an increased risk for pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, imaging is insufficient
for distinguishing benign cysts from those likely to progress to cancer forcing clinicians to rely on
biochemical analyses of acellular cyst fluid. The current assays display poor accuracy and require
large volumes of fluid not always available limiting their clinical utility. There is a profound unmet
clinical need for diagnostics that accurately grade dysplasia in mucinous pancreatic cyst fluids.
The objective of current SBIR Phase I grant (CA277913-01A1 effective May 2023) is to develop
and conduct clinical translation of a diagnostic assay panel using ultrasensitive detection methods
to grade dysplasia in pancreatic cysts. This assay will stratify
patients most at risk for progression to cancer thus providing high clinical utility.
The platform: Amplified Sciences has utilized a proprietary platform to translate to the company
roscopy platform is robust and readily
adaptable to other proteolytic enzymes as needed for this grant. To date, the company has made
strong progress on the Aims. The team has built a new direct-detection SERS ligand binding
platform (prototype stage) for two of the biomarkers, and adapted the existing enzymatic activity
assay for a third. Over 90 retrospective clinical samples have been procured, and all clinical
testing and statistical analysis should be complete by end of Phase 1. The company is on track
-ready assay protocol for full clinical validation and algorithm development in a
Phase 2 grant.
Several challenges have been met and overcome. Technical challenges including delays in the
supply chain have been overcome by securing new suppliers for chemicals, etc. Administrative
challenges include delays from securing invoices from vendors, so more frequent reminders have
been implemented. Finally, commercial challenges include limited funding for market research
with doctors and payers to gain the insights needed to prepare for commercial launch and
challenges in accessing clinicians at large academic centers. To overcome this, the company has
leveraged current clinical investigators for introductions. Finally, the current capital market for
fundraising is very challenging so the company has supplemented investor funds with non-dilutive
funding totaling $1M of research use only revenue and state and federal grants.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Validate a combination of three (3) protease activity markers to accurately distinguish
low- grade from high-grade mucinous pancreatic cystic neoplasms.
Aim 2: To develop quantitative assays for a panel of three (3) markers in low-volume mock cyst
fluid samples that enable diagnostic power evaluation in a clinical sample cohort.

The goals of the Biomedical Engineering (BME) Core within the Kansas Institute of Precision Medicine COBRE
is two-fold: (1) Provide pioneering tools for the isolation of Liquid Biopsy Markers (LBMs) and small molecules
of biological or clinical importance (Liquid Biopsy Unit); and (2) generate innovative microfluidic and nanofluidic
devices in plastics for translational research (Plastics Engineering Unit). Outputs from both units has generated
microfluidic tools to allow for the efficient isolation of disease biomarkers with the ability to process blood, plasma,
saliva, and urine samples. The unique infrastructure of the BME Core and its outputs assist the KIPM COBRE
members, including Research Project Leaders (RPLs) and Pilot Project Leaders (PPLs) as well as researchers
outside of the KIPM to advance their science and effectively competing for federally funded research projects.
Under the auspices of the BME Core, we have developed state-of-the-art assays and the associated microfluidic
tools to support discovery and translational work. Some of our microfluidic tools are used for the efficient isolation
of liquid biopsy markers, including extracellular vesicles (EVs), cell free molecules, and rare biological cells. EVs
are an evolving liquid biopsy marker – related markers include lipid nanoparticles, and polymer nanoparticles –
due to the high abundance found in biological fluids and the molecular cargo they carry in spite of their small
size (<200 nm). Accurate characterization (i.e., size, concentration, presence of specific surface proteins) of
these particles remains elusive requiring an array of optical instrumentation and highly trained personnel to infer
vague conclusions from indirect measurements and assumptions to deduce their properties. Peer review data
suggest that Spectradyne’s ARC™ particle analyzer delivers direct, accurate, and fast measurements that will
help users of our BME Core for securing tangible results and enabling new discoveries. The Spectradyne’s
technology allows for unique analyses of EVs and other nanoparticles such as polymer nanoparticles, liposomes,
viruses, bacteria etc. that can play a central role in the field of precision medicine, the central theme of the KIPM.
Ultimately, the novel analytical capabilities of this technology will allow for a better understanding of novel
biomarkers, such EVs or lipid/polymer nanoparticles allowing for concentration and payload determinations."

The HPTN 084 OLE allows for participants to discontinue contraception and if becoming pregnant to
continue active dosing with CAB LA throughout pregnancy and breastfeeding. The HPTN 084
pregnancy substudy will provide important information for prevention of HIV in people of reproductive
potential, when they are often most vulnerable to HIV. In addition, the pregnancy substudy will
provide valuable information about the safety and pharmacokinetics of CAB LA for pregnant and
lactating people and their infants.
Specifically, this substudy will contribute information about the incidence of pregnancy in a cohort of
women on oral and long-acting PrEP, assess maternal safety outcomes (Serious adverse events,
AEs, and weight gains), pregnancy outcomes (such as the rates of spontaneous abortion, ectopic
pregnancy, low birthweight, and early or full-term births), and infant safety outcomes (SAEs, AEs, and
growth). In addition, the substudy will assess pharmacokinetic parameters during the pre-pregnant,
pregnant, and post-partum periods, including concentration time profiles and trough CAB
concentrations. Utero/peripartum exposure will also be assessed by examining CAB concentrations
in cord blood and corresponding maternal plasma. Infant exposure through breastmilk will be
examining by analyzing CAB concentrations in maternal plasma, breastmilk, and infant plasma.

11017552,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Falls by older adults are often predictable and preventable, yet there is a notable lack of research evaluating
interventions to reduce the occurrence of recurrent falls in older adult Emergency Department (ED) patients.
Dr. Goldberg’s Beeson K76 project GAPcare II, the Geriatric Acute & Post-acute Care Coordination Program
for Fall Prevention in the Emergency Department, addresses this lack of research by further refining and
examining the intervention she created in her GEMSSTAR R03 project. In this intervention, patients,
caregivers, physical therapists (PTs), pharmacy specialists, and clinicians provide a patient-centric,
collaborative approach to fall prevention that bridges the ED visit with outpatient resources. PTs evaluate
geriatric patients in the ED immediately after their fall, perform a focused assessment of future fall risk and
determine the safety of discharge home. Pharmacists in the ED perform a medication therapy management
session aimed at reducing/tapering fall risk increasing medication. ED clinicians, patients and caregivers in
turn incorporate the advice offered by these professionals before the patient leaves the ED.
 In her Beeson K76 GAPcare II project, Dr. Goldberg will build on the lessons learned from the GEMSSTAR
R03 work. GAPcare II’s specific aims are to: (1) conduct field testing with geriatric patients with and without
cognitive impairment and their caregivers to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the Apple
Watch to objectively measure fall-related outcomes; (2) refine the GAPcare intervention and study protocol
based on lessons learned and findings from the GEMSSTAR R03 GAPcare I pilot study and conduct a small
open trial of the GAPcare II intervention; and (3) conduct a pilot randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of the
GAPcare II (n=200) intervention to obtain initial estimates of efficacy of GAPcare II to decrease recurrent falls
at 12 months relative to usual care. This investigation will provide Dr. Goldberg with critical pilot data and
expertise to submit a R01 proposal to NIA for a full-scale, multi-center, comprehensive RCT.
 Dr. Goldberg’s Beeson K76 award overarching aims are to develop and test an ED-based and post-discharge
protocol that reduces recurrent falls in older adults and to launch her physician-scientist career as an emerging
leader in geriatric emergency medicine. To achieve this goal, Dr. Goldberg will obtain additional training in
qualitative research, digital health, longitudinal data analysis, clinical trial methods, and leadership. This
expertise will be achieved through advanced coursework, leadership training, and intensive interactions with
her mentorship team. Her primary mentors, Dr. Roland Merchant, emergency medicine physician and
epidemiologist, and Dr. Vincent Mor, health services researcher and health policy expert, will provide training
in epidemiology, health services research, and leading policy initiatives. Her mentorship team also includes
experts in qualitative research, digital health, rehabilitation measures, longitudinal data analysis, clinical trial
methods, fall prevention and geriatric medication management."
11022861,"Cognitive decline in the aging brain is driven by overlapping neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathologies. Over 80% of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients co-present with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the vascular deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ). Though CAA and parenchymal Aβ plaques intersect at the levels of Aβ generation and clearance—and share APOE4 as their strongest risk factor—they trigger distinct disease processes: CAA develops insidiously to erode vascular structure and function, induce microbleeds, foment neuroinflammation, and complicate anti-Aβ antibody therapies. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of CAA formation, insult, and clearance in the context of Aβ plaque pathology and APOE genotype is essential to effectively target intertwined neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular pathways in dementia. Yet, the molecular and cellular processes underlying CAA remain incompletely understood. Single-cell genomics has provided insights into various neurological diseases—but not yet CAA because of a lack of high-quality human tissue at scale and the inability to effectively capture brain vascular cell types. Further, animal models of AD have lacked the ability to precisely control CAA formation for its mechanistic study. To address these challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise spanning vascular neuropathology, clinical imaging, single-cell genomics of the neurovascular unit, AD models, microglia, and APOE biology. We have organized 200 human postmortem brains along CAA progression from ROSMAP with rich demographic, genomic, pathologic, MRI imaging, and longitudinal cognitive data. We will profile these samples with our new brain vascular and immune cell-capturing VINE-seq and spatial genomics approaches. Further, we recently established in mouse models of AD a new paradigm where modulating microglial function is sufficient to control the timing and burden of CAA and microbleeds. We hypothesize that in the healthy aging brain, microglia consolidate soluble Aβ into dense core parenchymal plaques to prevent more damaging vascular Aβ—and this process is disrupted by APOE4 and vascular dysfunction. Thus, we expect enhancing or impairing microglial function will modulate the balance of CAA versus parenchymal Aβ plaque burden. With parallel mechanistic studies in mouse models of CAA and molecular analyses of CAA in human tissue, we will elucidate key microglial mechanisms regulating the formation of vascular CAA versus parenchymal Aβ plaques, define single-cell and spatial human brain immunovascular signatures of CAA, and reveal how brain vascular Aβ clearance mechanisms synergize with microglia to clear CAA. With hypothesis-driven functional studies and foundational human molecular datasets of CAA informing one another, our integrated studies will advance fundamental understanding of CAA to inform the development of sensitive blood biomarkers and new approaches to enhance the safety of anti-Aβ immunotherapies."
10808886,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a heterogeneous group of rare inherited diseases caused by 
mutations in genes involved in protein glycosylation. The most common CDG, PMM2-CDG, results from 
mutations in the gene phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2), encoding an enzyme that converts mannose 6- 
phosphate (M6P) to mannose 1-phosphate (M1P). Defects in PMM2 limit the production of GDP-mannose, a 
nucleotide sugar essential to synthesize precursors needed for N-linked glycosylation. Reduced GDP- 
mannose causes protein hypoglycosylation and numerous clinical phenotypes. The connection between 
hypoglycosylated proteins and phenotypes is unclear, creating a major gap in our knowledge of CDG 
disease pathogenesis. PMM2-CDG patients exhibit variable penetrance indicating that genetic and/or 
environmental factors modify disease. We characterized a zebrafish model of PMM2-CDG and identified two 
classes of enzymes, the protein proconvertases (PCs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as candidate 
drivers of pathology. Analyses of cartilage defects in pmm2 mutant zebrafish revealed a block in early 
chondrocyte development that is associated with defective processing of the cell adhesion molecule N- 
cadherin. N-cadherin is sequentially cleaved by furin PCs and MMPs, and both exhibit altered activity in pmm2 
mutant zebrafish. The proposed studies address the hypothesis that reduced glycosylation alters the 
activity of PCs like furin, initiating a cascade involving MMPs that disrupts processing of key cell 
adhesion molecules, including N-cadherin. We will define how hypoglycosylation of protein processing 
enzymes alters tissue development; determine whether there is a common mechanism among CDG subtypes; 
and identify genetic modifiers of CDG disease severity. Toward these goals in Aim 1 we will develop novel 
zebrafish lines that express wild type and glycan-deficient FLAG-tagged forms of several PCs and MMP 
enzymes. We will use these tools to define how hypoglycosylation of individual enzymes contributes to 
impaired chondrogenesis in PMM2-CDG. In Aim 2 we will perform RNA sequencing on several zebrafish 
models of PMM2, STT3A and STT3B-CDG to identify the pathogenic mechanisms and molecular networks 
that are commonly or uniquely altered in CDG. Using these analyses in combination with novel Drosophila 
models we will also pursue genetic modifiers of CDG disease severity. The molecular and genetic pathways 
identified as sensitive to hypoglycosylation will provide foundational information to develop much needed 
therapies. Further, the platform established within this proposal will create the road map to ultimately study 
how disruption of other N-glycosylation genes causes disease."
11013492,"Rare diseases collectively impact more than 30 million individuals in the United States and 300-400 million 
individuals worldwide. There are an estimated 7-10 thousand known rare diseases, of which approximately 
80% have a genetic etiology. Although important, genetic sequence data alone is insufficient to determine 
mechanism and diagnosis of rare genetic disorders (RGDs). In-silico variant pathogenicity prediction and 
phenomic information are also critical, though even with these, diagnostic rates remain frustratingly low. Novel 
research paradigms, such as a gene-to-patient approach that samples individuals with high confidence in-silico 
predicted pathogenic variants from large databases and asks if they share a common phenotype could 
promote novel discovery and improve diagnostic rates; however, this approach is hampered by the inability to 
easily extract phenotypic information from unstructured data and reliably identify a shared phenotype among 
individuals. RGD research that combines genomic and phenomic with other ‘omics’ data also has potential for 
improved diagnostic yield and mechanistic understanding; however, these endeavors face significant 
obstacles, notably a dearth of multiomic data fusion and analysis methods. Practical RGD clinical diagnosis 
additionally requires patient specific diagnostic pathways, the lack of which has resulted in unacceptably 
complex and lengthy diagnostic odysseys that places significant burden on individuals suffering with RGDs. 
Our proposal addresses these critical limitations through novel artificial intelligence (AI) method development 
that will integrate information rich biological ontologies with multiomic data. We will first extend graph neural 
network node representation learning methods and develop a custom genetic search algorithm to enable 
discovery of a shared population phenotype among individuals in the absence of a disease specification, thus 
enabling a gene-to-patient research paradigm. We will further apply these methods to integrate node 
representations for a tissue-to-gene expression knowledge graph with genetic sequence data and clinically 
accessible tissue (CAT) transcriptomic results in a transformer based deep learning model to predict tissuespecific aberrant splicing pathogenicity. Finally, we will combine these methods in a pilot clinical decision 
support system to recommend personalized genetic testing and clinical tests to support RGD diagnosis. This 
pilot system will leverage large language models anchored to biological ontologies to enable clinicians and 
patients to pose questions regarding reasoning, benefits, and risks of recommended clinical tests in an 
efficient, flexible, conversational form. In combination, these outcomes will dramatically improve researchers’ 
ability to utilize multiomic data to elucidate the mechanisms by which variants affect phenotype and guide 
clinicians in the diagnosis and care of individuals with RGDs, thereby substantially reducing patient burden and 
improving health outcomes."
11013494,"Mendelian disease affects approximately 1 in 17 people across the globe and has so far been associated with 
over 4800 genes. There is a compelling need to improve our understanding of rare genomic variation; current 
genetic analysis techniques for Mendelian disease have a limited success rate meaning that despite 
comprehensive genomic testing, many patients and families are left without a molecular diagnosis. It is a pivotal 
time for rare disease research, diagnostics and genomic medicine, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) likely 
to be the method of choice for genetic analysis for the short to mid-term future. However, there are significant 
limitations with the current chemistry and informatics technology, and our understanding/interpretation of 
variants; Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) relies on short, paired-end read sequencing of up to 150bp which 
comprise limited genomic context, and to truly capitalize on WGS coverage, we must better understand the 
variation outside of gene panels and coding exons that remain the focus of clinical diagnostics. Thus, there are 
many contributors to the missing heritability including undiscovered genes, variants of uncertain significance 
(VUS), non-exonic variants and structural rearrangements and genes/variants intractable to NGS pipelines. The 
primary goal of this study is to better understand missing heritability in rare disease. Previous work in my 
laboratory has demonstrated that novel genes and non-coding variants in known inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) 
genes are a significant cause of disease and we have established methodology to be able to characterize the 
effect of splice variants using blood derived mRNA and nanopore sequencing. Simultaneous work on the utility 
of ultralong-read sequencing for difficult to resolve cases has shown promising preliminary results. This 
application aims to build on these findings and develop the studies in IRD genes, expanding to broader genetic 
disease patients and families who have undergone testing at GGC. Aim 1 will utilize existing anonymized WGS 
datasets from the 100,000 genomes project to identify novel candidate disease genes and pathogenic noncoding variants by applying cutting-edge bioinformatics tools. Up to two genes will be taken forward in functional 
studies in collaboration with other research groups as separate projects. Noncoding/VUS will be analyzed by 
RT-PCR/nanopore sequencing to determine damaging effects and thus reclassify those variants as pathogenic. 
Aim 2 will investigate the potential utility of adaptive sampling targeted nanopore sequencing for clinical use in 
unsolved patients and families, and those where it is suspected that the culprit gene is intractable to NGS. For 
this exploratory work, we will use the model of IRD to test this in the first instance, targeting genes including 
OPN1LW/OPN1MW, ABCA4, USH2A, EYS, PRPF31, TYR, genes known to have limitations with coverage, 
phasing or haplotypes that limit the ability of NGS for diagnosis. Further targets will be investigated in 
collaboration with GGC leadership. We will examine the ability of adaptive sampling long-read sequencing to 
provide sufficient coverage, depth and read length to enable full characterization of clinically relevant intractable 
genomic regions. These studies are novel, being at the cutting edge of genomics for human disease and 
capitalize on the expertise of the applicant and the outstanding research environment of GGC."
11013540,"Excess adipose tissue (obesity) has been identified as a leading risk factor for developing fatty liver disease and 
type 2 diabetes. Paradoxically, the marked absence of adipose tissue (lipodystrophy) also leads to these 
comorbidities. These observations suggest that adipose function, not quantity, is critical for systemic metabolic 
regulation. The primary function of healthy adipose tissue is the regulated storage of lipids when nutrients are 
abundant and mobilization of free fatty acids and glycerol when nutrients are scarce, but dysfunction of these 
processes leads to ectopic lipid storage in the liver, which drives metabolic disease. Dogma suggests excessive 
free fatty acid export from visceral adipose dumps into the portal vein, overwhelming hepatic metabolism leading 
to hepatic steatosis. Obese patients have a reduced capacity to store fatty acids in adipose tissue and 
dysregulated lipolysis. However, recent studies suggest that ~40 % of hepatic lipids are derived by hepatic de 
novo lipogenesis (DNL), the conversion of carbohydrates to lipids within the liver. Hepatic DNL is regulated by 
the nutrient-sensing AMP Protein Kinase (AMPK), which suppresses the activity and expression of many DNL 
enzymes. The goal of this 3-year project is to establish the mechanistic links between adipose tissue dysfunction 
and dysregulated hepatic DNL. In adipocytes, triglycerides are generated through the glycerol-3-phosphate 
pathway. The penultimate step is the generation of diacylglycerol through the phosphatidic acid 
phosphohydrolase activity of lipin 1 (gene name Lpin1). Our preliminary data shows that in humans adipose, 
LPIN1 expression positively correlates with insulin sensitivity and negatively corelates to hepatic DNL. In line 
with this, we have generated mice lacking lipin 1 in adipose tissue, which display a lean, yet metabolically 
unhealthy phenotype that includes hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Importantly, these mice also have 
increased rates of hepatic DNL and expression of DNL enzymes that AMPK normally suppresses. Together 
these data suggest that inhibiting adipose tissue triglyceride synthesis activates de novo hepatic lipid synthesis 
from alternative carbon sources. We hypothesize that dysfunctional adipose tissue reduces hepatic nutrient 
sensing capacity through chronic AMPK inactivation driving DNL and hepatic steatosis. We also hypothesize 
that re-activation of hepatic AMPK will restore hepatic nutrient sensing serving to lower DNL and hepatic lipid 
storage. Because obesity is an acquired disease, we will use a model of adult-onset adipose dysfunction, an 
inducible adipose specific lipin 1 KO model. We will use comprehensive metabolic testing combined with 
phospho-proteomics to assess AMPK activation of hepatic DNL. We will overexpress constitutively active AMPK 
in livers of our adipose dysfunction models to rescue hepatic metabolism by suppressing DNL. We will also use 
multi-organ biopsies from the same patients undergoing abdominal surgery to confirm that LPIN1 expression 
inversely correlates with hepatic AMPK activation and identify additional novel molecular relationships between 
adipose tissue dysfunction and hepatic disease progression using a multi-omic approach."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an existential threat to global human health, causing ~1.3M deaths and ~50M
years of life lost annually. Antibiotics are the cornerstone of modern medicine, and we stand to lose advances in
treating myriad diseases if we lose the arms race with AMR. There is an urgent need for novel antibiotics with
unique chemical structures and differentiated mechanisms of action (MOA). The ability of bacteria to rapidly
mutate and develop resistance necessitates the selection of targets that are not only essential but also the
products of multiple genes. The membrane represents such a target and has been successfully exploited by
host immune systems, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), AMP-like therapeutics such as polymyxins, and
antiseptics. Membrane-targeting small molecules have certain favorable properties relative to AMPs, such as
simpler manufacturing and the potential for better pharmacokinetics. However, despite the promise, membrane-
targeting small molecules have yet to obtain regulatory approval due to challenges with selectivity for bacteria
and safety in vivo. We have discovered a novel class of membrane-modifying antimicrobials, called Anti-infective
Conjugated Electrolytes (ACEs), that we aim to develop into life-saving treatments for the greatest AMR threats
such as lower respiratory infections caused by K. pneumoniae. ACEs are highly selective for bacteria, rapidly
bactericidal, active in vivo, and have anti-biofilm activity, low cytotoxicity, and no hemolytic properties. Subtleties
of the MOA are still under investigation, but ACEs are not lytic and do not exert their antimicrobial activity through
non-specific membrane permeabilization or depolarization. Instead, ACEs induce membrane remodeling, which
is suspected to cause mislocalization or dysfunction of essential membrane proteins. ACE structure-activity
relationships (SAR) have been elucidated and laid the foundation for our recent partnership with NIH Center for
Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria (CC4CARB). New ACE scaffolds co-designed with CC4CARB serve as
the initial subject matter for this project. We will assess ~40 ACEs synthesized by CC4CARB to elucidate
additional SAR and utilize this information to design an additional ~40 ACE derivatives of promising subfamilies
(Aim 1). From this composite set of ACEs, we will identify promising leads via a gated-tier approach (Aim 2). The
activity of derivatives will first be assessed against a panel of critical gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens.
ACEs with high activity and low cytotoxicity will pass to the second tier of in vitro activity and safety testing. The
highest performing 6-8 ACEs will then be assayed for their bactericidal kinetics and antibiofilm activity against
K. pneumoniae. Additionally, the activity of these derivates will be determined in host-relevant media as well as
a Galleria infection model. 4 ACEs will be selected for assessment of resistance development, efficacy in murine
models of lung infection caused by K. pneumoniae, in vivo safety, and pharmacokinetics (Aim 3). Successful
completion of this Phase 1 project will validate the ACE platform, identify new lead ACE subfamilies, and provide
SAR insights that can be exploited in subsequent lead optimization as part of a Phase 2 project."
11008243,"Project Summary
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the leading cause of viral hospitalization and death in infants and young
children, and also a major cause of respiratory illness in immunocompromised and elderly. Unfortunately, for
the millions infected with RSV each year, there is no currently no treatment option available.
 Like many respiratory pathogens, RSV spreads in the lungs by shedding daughter virions from infected
cells exclusively back into the airways. From there, RSV must traverse the airway mucus (AM) before
infecting other neighboring cells, remaining restricted to the airways with little-to-no systemic viremia. This
important mechanism of spread makes RSV difficult to target by systemically dosed therapies; the antiviral
drugs need to make their way to the airway mucus in order to inactivate virions and halt infection. We believe
an RSV-specific, safe, and effective antiviral therapy that can be inhaled directly into the respiratory tract using
a hand-held device at home would provide a powerful treatment option.
 To meet this goal, Inhalon has been advancing IN-002, a mAb that binds and neutralizes RSV F protein
with picomolar affinity, and has minimal risks of viral escape. Importantly, in addition to the well-established
IgG Fc effector functions, IN-002 is also engineered to possess Fc N-glycans optimized to trap RSV in AM.
Once trapped, RSV virions are quickly purged from the airways via natural mucociliary clearance mechanisms.
We have further formulated IN-002 to be stably nebulized using a portable vibrating mesh nebulizer. In a
neonatal lamb model of RSV infection, nebulized IN-002 reduced RSV viral load in the lungs and BALF to
almost non-detectible levels within just 3 days. Inhalon has already manufactured clinical trial materials, and
completed the full range of IND-enabling studies including GLP inhalation tox, tissue cross-reactivity and
nebulization characterization studies. Inhalon is thus in position to execute a Phase 1 study for IN-002 in 2024.
Inhalon has strong experience carrying out clinical studies with its inhaled mAb pipeline, being the first
company to successfully complete a Phase 1 study for an inhaled mAb therapy for COVID (IN-006), and more
recently executed a Phase 1b study to directly compare pulmonary distribution of the same mAb given by IV
vs. by inhalation. This makes Inhalon exceptionally well positioned to execute a Phase 1 study for IN-002.
 In this proposal, we seek to obtain support to complete the non-clinical activities associated with the
Phase 1 study, including processing of collected clinical trial biospecimens to determine drug levels in nasal
swabs and serum, perform biostatistics calculations and PK modeling, and perform the medical writing to
complete the clinical study report. These activities would in turn put Inhalon in a position to initiate a Phase 2
study to determine the efficacy of IN-002 in RSV-infected individuals. The work will further aid the development
of future generations of inhaled, mAb-based therapies for a variety of pulmonary indications."
11008244,"Project Summary/Abstract
 There are 2.5 million patients in the United States annually who receive knee surgeries, such as knee
replacements and ligament repairs and as the population rapidly ages the number of these surgeries is
expected to more than triple by 2030. These procedures account for over $7 billion in spending by Medicare
alone and as such, Medicare has identified knee surgery as a major target for cost reduction. While the surgery
itself has a relatively high success rate, patients must undergo extensive physical therapy to fully recover.
Physical therapy costs are high, usually requiring a significant number of in-person physical therapy sessions
combined with daily at-home exercises. Furthermore, full recovery can be difficult to achieve as decline in
muscle strength is often associated with knee injuries and surgery - patients cannot exercise with typical loads
during recovery.
 This SBIR project will reduce the cost of recovery from lower limb orthopedic injury or surgery through the
development of a telerehabilitation device that provides motorized exercise modes coupled with blood flow
restriction to enhance the effectiveness of low-load exercise while recording data and sharing progress with the
patient’s care team, whether the patient is in a clinic or at home. Restricting blood flow during exercise offers a
promising model for recovery from orthopedic surgery as high-load weight training cannot be performed, while
low-load training alone often leads to muscle atrophy. Benefits of an all-in-one device include significant
reduction in clinic visits (reduction in cost, workforce burden, and patient burden), better support for patients in
rural communities, reduction in risk of muscle atrophy, reduction in pain during exercise, higher at-home
exercise compliance, clinician access to data and trends, and opportunities for aggregate data trending to
inform optimal exercise plans.
 The specific aims of this project are to develop, test, and evaluate a lightweight and cost effective device that
provides actuated stretching and strengthening of the user’s knee joint, while restricting the flow of blood from
the leg to enhance the benefits of the exercise. Evaluation of the system will comprise two pilot usability
studies, one with experienced physical therapists and one with patients recovering from ligament
reconstruction. In Phase II, the system will be further refined and then evaluated with a larger, statistically
significant study to determine safety and efficacy of the device. Commercialization of the technology should
lead to significantly reduced costs, better outcomes, and a lower logistical burden to recovery by reducing the
number of in-person physical therapy sessions for some of the most common surgical procedures in the US."

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic, with ongoing substantial HIV

test-and-treat strategies are successful at reducing HIV transmission, population-level trials have shown mixed
effectiveness of test-and-treat strategies to reduce HIV incidence. There is evidence of disparities in testing
and treatment engagement, particularly among marginalized populations. Furthermore, these disparities are
frequently along the same characteristics as sexual network clustering. Therefore, a potential explanation for a
smaller than expected incidence impact is sexual network clustering, partnering of like-with-like, by HIV testing
and treatment. Indeed, my preliminary work showed that couples in South Africa who reported never testing for
HIV were nearly 2 times more likely (1.9, 95% CI=1.8-2.0) to be partnered with one another than expected by
random chance. But this finding needs replication, as there is little empirical evidence to support these claims.
Through network analyses and simulations, contextualized with community interviews, this career development
award will assess whether sexual network clustering impacts the effectiveness of HIV treatment as prevention.
These results will inform population-level treatment targets. Further, they will allow me to test the utility of
network-driven strategies to drive testing and treatment and provide clear guidance to maximize the impact of
these interventions. Research aims will include: 1) Identify the network context of HIV test-and-treat
interventions in SSA by (A.) Characterizing the sexual network position of people engaged in test-and-treat,
and (B.) Estimating the level of sexual network clustering by test-and-treat; 2) Evaluate the impact of network-
driven strategies of HIV interventions using network models parametrized with data on engagement in HIV
test-and-treat and sexual network context; 3) Translate modeling and network analyses to real-world settings.
This proposal will leverage previously collected data from Uganda, Malawi, and Nigeria: the Rakai Community
Cohort Study, the TRUST/RV368 Study, Population-based HIV Impact Assessments, and the Likoma Network
Study, and collect original qualitative data in Rakai, Uganda. These sources include data on both “general
populations” and “key populations,” specifically fisherfolk and men who have sex with men and transgender
women, at increased risk of HIV infection. This work will build on my existing global collaborations, while
developing my expertise in network science and translation through a mentorship team with extensive
experience in network data collection and conducting community-informed work. Building on these findings,
future funding will be sought to collect expanded sexual network data and develop network-level intervention
strategies. My training plan will include gaining experience in participatory modeling and qualitative work, a
novel skillset among network modelers. This career development project will provide me with expertise to
begin an independent career as a leader in HIV and sexual network research."
11009109,"People living with HIV (PLWH) face a high risk of neurocognitive impairments in depression and experience
higher levels of impulsivity. The lifetime prevalence of cognitive depression in PLWH is twice that of HIV
seronegative individuals. Cocaine abuse has been shown to enhance the incidence of HIV-1 associated
cognitive depression and exacerbate its severity. Prolonged exposure to HIV-1 viral proteins causes
dysregulation of monoamine transmission despite the advent of combination antiretroviral therapies (cART),
which has been implicated as a key factor in developing impulsivity, cognitive depression, and cocaine abuse
among HIV positive population. Results from our previous funding cycles have demonstrated that in vivo
expression of HIV-1 Tat protein dysregulates monoamine transmission by its allosteric interaction with
dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) in inducible Tat transgenic (iTat-tg)
mice. Furthermore, our preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the in vivo Tat expression
increases serotonin (5-HT) release and decreases 5-HT uptake through serotonin transporter (SERT) in the
midbrain of iTat-tg mice, however, EcoHIV infection decreases 5-HT release in the midbrain and SERT-
mediated 5-HT uptake in hippocampus of humanized mice for chronic HIV infection. These findings suggest
that HIV-1 viral proteins dysregulate monoamine homeostasis via inhibition of monoamine transporters, which
may potentially increase vulnerability to developing impulsivity, cognitive depression, and cocaine abuse in
HIV-infected individuals. Studying single Tat protein allow us to identify targets in the brain for Tat binding and
develop therapeutic intervention for HIV-induced neurological damages. Indeed, a novel allosteric inhibitor of
monoamine transporters, SRI-32743, attenuates not only Tat-inhibited DA transport via DAT but also 5-HT
uptake via SERT, and alleviates Tat-potentiated cognitive impairments and depressive-like behaviors. We
hypothesize that HIV-1 Tat, acting via the unique binding sites, perturbs the monoamine transporter regulatory
network and exacerbates cocaine-induced pathophysiological changes in monoaminergic transmission,
resulting in impulsivity and depressive-like behaviors in the context of NeuroHIV. Three specific aims are
proposed in investigating this hypothesis: (1) through computational modeling and experimental validation,
identify the recognition binding pockets on human SERT for Tat, cocaine, allosteric modulator and explore the
potential interactions with Tat and cocaine, (2) characterize the pathophysiological role of the SERT in Tat- and
cocaine-dysregulated monoaminergic transmission, and (3) perform the proof-of-concept studies using a
pharmacological approach with chemical probes to establish their potential for therapeutic application in
treating impulsivity and depression. Collectively, this proposal is anticipated to provide both new therapeutics
and mechanistic insights into how HIV promotes dysregulation of monoamine transmission in the context of
poor impulsivity control, cognitive depression, and cocaine abuse."
11009359,"Project Summary: Significance: Although disproportionally affected by HIV, people of color experience
significant disparities in the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care continuum. The accessibility of community
pharmacies and patient trust in pharmacists suggest that pharmacists can contribute significantly to increasing
equity in PrEP care. Pharmacist-led PrEP programs are expanding in the United States, with positive outcomes
in PrEP initiation and retention in care for those taking PrEP. Despite great potential for pharmacy-based PrEP
care, implicit racial bias is common among healthcare providers, including pharmacists, and may reduce the
effectiveness of pharmacist-led PrEP delivery. Candidate: I am a Ph.D.-level pharmacist with a strong
foundation in general pharmacy-related research; however, my research interests have pivoted in recent years
to HIV and racial disparities in care. My long-term goal is to become an independent NIH-funded clinical
investigator focused on developing and implementing pharmacy-based interventions to reduce healthcare
disparities in HIV treatment and prevention. I am therefore pursuing additional mentored training in key areas for
this new career path. Training aims: I propose training in (1) designing and conducting qualitative research
using implementation science frameworks; (2) implicit bias intervention adaptation; (3) simulation-based learning
in healthcare research; and (4) designing and executing clinical trials. Mentor team: Dr. Jessica Haberer
(primary mentor; clinical trials), Dr. Sheree Schwartz (implementation science), Dr. Nao Hagiwara (healthcare
providers’ bias and racial disparities), and Dr. Christina Psaros (qualitative methods. Advisor team: Dr. Musie
Ghebremichael (statistical methods), Dr. Aleda Chen (cultural competency), and Dr. Samreen Vora (simulation).
Research aims: The primary goal of this proposal is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
impact of an adapted, evidence-based intervention to reduce implicit racial bias among pharmacists who have
experience with or are willing to prescribe PrEP. In Aim 1, I will use a qualitative approach with the Health Equity
Implementation Framework to elicit the opinions of pharmacy interns, pharmacy managers, and policymakers
on relevant factors for implementing an evidence-based intervention to reduce bias. In Aim 2, I will use Aim 1
data to adapt the intervention to fit community pharmacy settings. In Aim 3, I will conduct a pilot trial with 70
pharmacy interns who will be randomized 1:1 to the adapted intervention vs control (a course on implicit bias) to
test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the adapted intervention in reducing implicit bias.
Feedback on the trial findings will also be obtained through interviews of pharmacy managers and policymakers.
Impact: Based on my solid foundation in pharmacy practice research, outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring
team, a strong institutional commitment, and this innovative research area, I am well-positioned to complete this
project, achieve my training goals, and become an independent clinical investigator to committed to reducing
healthcare disparities among disadvantaged people with HIV or those at risk of acquiring the infection."
11022329,"PROJECT ABSTRACT - PARENT AWARD
CANDIDATE: I am currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care
at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine (WUSM). My career goal is to become an
independent, federally funded physician-scientist who utilizes rigorous implementation science and community-
based participatory research methods to improve the lives of patients with asthma, especially those from
disadvantaged backgrounds. To date I have received funding from the NIH Loan Repayment Program,
institutional T32 and KL2 awards, and the American Lung Association. While this past support has been
foundational, to reach my long-term goals, advanced training in implementation science and community-based
participatory research is required. In this proposal, I am mentored by world-renowned leaders in these areas.
Together, we have designed a research project and career development plan that, we believe, is impactful and
will provide me the training necessary to be competitive for R01-level, or equivalent, support before its
conclusion.
PROPOSED ENVIRONMENT: This proposal occurs within three complementary settings. First, this research
occurs at WUSM. To date, I have benefited immensely from WUSM’s career development resources and will
continue to leverage them to reach my career goals. The second setting for this proposal is the Brown School
at Washington University, which is one of the leading institutions for implementation science and community-
based participatory research. During a K23 award I will take two classes in advanced implementation science
methodology offered by its expert faculty. Finally, this study will be deployed within community health centers
in the St. Louis Integrated Health Network and complemented by didactic education and participation in
activities within the Center for Community Health Partnership and Research at WUSM.
RESEARCH ABSTRACT: The NHLBI’s asthma guideline body recommends single maintenance and reliever
therapy (SMART) for all patients with moderate/severe asthma. This recommendation is based on findings that
SMART decreases the risk of asthma exacerbations by one-third. However, within a network of federally
qualified health centers in St. Louis with whom we have partnered, <10% of asthma patients are prescribed
SMART. My team and I are developing and contextualizing a multi-level SMART implementation bundle, which
includes: clinician-level education with practice facilitation/supervision; an audit and feedback program; and
provision of patient-centered, electronic SMART education aides with updated asthma action plans. In this
proposed type 1 hybrid stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial, we aim to: 1) assess the effectiveness of the
SMART implementation bundle at increasing prescription of SMART (Aim 1, 1° effectiveness outcome), and
(2) utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide a quantitative and qualitative assessment of implementation
outcomes, including adoption (Aim 2, 1° implementation outcome)."
11030468,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity and the associated insulin resistance are the established risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although
more than 90% of T2D patients are overweight or obese, only about 30% of obese people develop T2D. One
major determining factor for the development of T2D in obese patients is islet −cell decomposition or failure,
resulting in relative insulin deficiency. It is well documented that islet failure has a strong genetic predisposition.
Genome-wide association study (GWAS) provides a powerful tool to associate genetic variants (SNPs) with T2D.
However, the vast majority of the diabetes risk SNPs from GWAS are found in the non-coding regions, posing
significant challenges to identifying the SNP-associated genes for T2D. 3’untranslated regions (3’UTR) are non-
coding sequences containing cis-regulatory elements (CRE), such as binding sites for miRNAs and RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs) that regulate mRNA fate and protein expression. Alternative polyadenylation (APA) at the 3’UTR
is an RNA-processing mechanism that generates mRNA isoforms with significantly different 3’UTR lengths with
distinct CREs. SNPs that regulate APA may lengthen or shorten 3’UTR, thereby altering gene expression and
function. We recently developed a novel 3’UTR APA quantitative trait loci (3’aQTLs) analysis tool to colocalize
disease-associated SNPs with APA. Using the 3’aQTLs tool, we found that the lengthening of 3’UTR of zinc
finger CCCH domain-containing protein 13 (ZC3H13) in the pancreas was highly associated with T2D. ZC3H13
is a key epitranscriptomic factor that forms an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification writer complex with
methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14). Both METTL3 and METTL14-
mediated m6A have been shown to be essential for -cell function. Our preliminary data show that longer
ZC3H13 3’UTR reduced ZC3H13 protein expression without changes to mRNA levels. Knocking down ZC3H13
suppressed insulin production in the cultured -cells. Furthermore, ZC3H13 heterozygous knockout mice
exhibited impaired glucose tolerance with reduced insulin levels when challenged with a high-fat diet. We,
therefore, hypothesize that the reduced ZC3H13 protein expression from 3’aQTLs-associated 3’UTR
lengthening contributes to the genetic predisposition of islet failure in T2D. We propose three aims to study what
SNPs cause ZC3H13 3’UTR lengthening, why ZC3H13 3’UTR lengthening reduces protein expression, and
how the reduced ZC3H13 protein impairs islet function. Aim 1: To identify the causal SNPs impacting APA of
ZC3H13 using functionally informed fine-mapping of 3'aQTLs. Aim 2: To determine the mechanisms by which
3’UTR lengthening reduces ZC3H13 protein expression. Aim 3: To investigate the mechanisms by which
reduced ZC3H13 expression impairs insulin production and islet function. Our studies will advance the field by
uncovering ZC3H13 APA as a novel genetic risk factor and elucidating ZC3H13-mediated epitranscriptomic
regulation as a novel mechanism for the impaired -cell function in T2D."
11024726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the US, pervasive and insidious disparities in maternal health are urgent public health concerns. Social
determinants of health (SDoH), such as poverty, exposure to racism, and limited access to care, critically shape
perinatal outcomes, resulting in greater risk of adverse maternal and neonatal health outcomes for low-income
and minority individuals. High-quality antenatal care supports optimal health, yet typically fails to meet the needs
of marginalized populations. Improving the health of pregnant people in a patient-centered, equity-focused
manner requires innovative models of care delivery across the spectrum of maternal care. One strategy
is patient navigation (PN), a longitudinal, barrier-focused, patient-centered intervention that offers support for
health services. Although antenatal care is an ideal setting for PN, the benefits of antenatal PN for overall
maternal and perinatal health have not been rigorously evaluated in randomized trials.
This proposal aims to test the efficacy of an innovative antenatal care PN model that extends and expands care
for low-income pregnant individuals via the Partnering with Antenatal Navigators to Transform Health in
Pregnancy (PATH) Trial. We will randomize 550 racially and ethnically diverse, nulliparous pregnant individuals
with low income (publicly funded antenatal care or income <200% of federal poverty line) to receive PN via PATH
versus usual antenatal care. Participants randomized to receive PATH will receive intensive, individualized PN
services throughout pregnancy. As a multilevel, multidomain, health equity-focused intervention, PATH is
grounded in understanding and addressing SDoH to promote self-efficacy, enhance access, support
communication, and sustain healthcare engagement. All participants will undergo surveys, interviews, and
medical record reviews at 5 study visits from enrollment (<20 weeks of gestation) through 9 months postpartum.
Aim 1 will evaluate whether PATH, compared to usual care, improves a composite of maternal adverse outcomes
(hypertensive disorders, preterm birth, postpartum hemorrhage, severe maternal morbidity, mortality) and (Sub-
Aim 1) healthcare utilization. Aim 2 will evaluate whether PATH, compared to usual care, improves a composite
of perinatal adverse outcomes (NICU, low birthweight, small- and large-for-gestational age, perinatal death) and
(Sub-Aim 2) healthcare utilization. Exploratory Aims 1 and 2 will evaluate whether PATH’s efficacy varies by age,
self-reported race/ethnicity, or chronic disease status. Aim 3 will evaluate patient, clinician, navigator, and health
system experiences with PATH, which will be guided by implementation science principles and accomplished
via serial collection of patient-reported outcomes, individual interviews, and process mapping exercises. The
PATH Trial will fill a significant evidence gap by demonstrating whether antenatal PN among low-income
pregnant individuals, who are disproportionately at risk for adverse outcomes, is an effective strategy
to improve perinatal health and reduce disparities. PATH represents a critical step in understanding how to
improve maternal health for disadvantaged individuals, thus achieving the goals of the NIH IMPROVE Initiative."
11022118,"Understanding the pathogenesis of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and vascular contributions to dementia (VCID) is increasingly important to help protect the cognitive and mental health of an aging population. Recent technological advances now permit us to measure thousands of proteins and metabolites simultaneously in body fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and single cell and spatial transcriptomics reveal tissue pathology at unprecedented resolution. Leveraging these new technologies to investigate CSVD and VCID will help to unravel the complex and heterogeneous mechanisms underlying these diseases. Here we take advantage of three resources led by our institution to best pursue these investigations. The first resource is a large collection of CSF samples from the Washington University Knight Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC) and Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts. The second resource is a collection of human brain tissue specimens from these same cohorts. The third is extensive neuroimaging and analytical pipelines that can identify dissociable patterns of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), which are a key neuroimaging feature of CSVD. By combining these resources together, our first aim is to identify specific CSF proteins and metabolites related to each of 5 different WMH spatial patterns (i.e., topographies). This approach is likely to identify both shared and separate molecular correlates for each of the WMH topographies, which differentiate vascular risk factors and Alzheimer’s disease related pathologies. We will also determine how identified CSF correlates of CSVD relate to the development of cognitive impairment. Our second aim is to sample 5 regions of the brain, based on each of the different WMH topographies, from Knight-ADRC and ADNI human brain specimens. These will then undergo single cell and spatial transcriptomics, as well as further analysis using a vessel enrichment technique. We will relate these transcriptional data to premortem imaging and postmortem histopathology features from each specimen. The third and last aim is to perform a parallel transcriptomic analysis in rodent models of hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, both without and with treatment. Comparing rodent data to the human results will shed light on the validity of these rodent models for understanding CSVD in humans and may potentially reveal specific molecular mechanisms that underlie these diseases. We intend to use the results from all three aims to identify potential biomarkers and druggable targets. We are strongly committed to sharing all of the data produced by these efforts openly, and collectively hope that they will lead to a clearer mechanistic understanding of CSVD and VCID."

holds considerable promise as a future treatment option for these prevalent disorders. However
initial work in the acceptability, tolerability, and safety of this approach must be conducted first.

11023018,"Project Summary
Studies examining the relationship between psychiatric illness and suicide from the Department of Veterans
Affairs indicate that individuals with bipolar disorder have the highest rate of suicide, which is even greater
compared to post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and major depression. When left untreated, bipolar
disorder has a 5-15% risk of death by suicide, making it a top priority for Veterans' mental health care.
Individuals with bipolar disorder behave impulsively – even during euthymic periods and understanding the
relationship between impulsivity and suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder may assist in the identification of
individuals at greatest risk for a future suicide attempt. Progress in understanding this relationship has been
significantly hampered, however, by the conflation of different measures of impulsivity. Impulsivity can be
measured as a relatively stable trait using self-report measures or as a state measure assessed through the
use of behavioral paradigms sensitive to changing environmental contingencies. Models of state impulsivity
have focused on (1) “rapid-response inhibition” involving difficulty inhibiting responses that are prepotent in the
context of changing environmental situations and (2) “choice impulsivity” defined as the inability to delay
gratification for a larger reward. These models correlate weakly, but strongly overlap with brain regions
implicated in the neurobiology of bipolar disorder. We propose investigating measures of state and trait
impulsivity in 40 euthymic Veterans with bipolar disorder (BD) and a suicide attempt history (BD+S), 40
euthymic Veterans with bipolar disorder and no suicide attempt history (BD-S) and 40 healthy controls (HC).
The primary suicide outcome measure in this study will be suicide attempts assessed using the Columbia
Suicide Severity Rating Scale and medical record review. This will be complemented through the use of a
broader composite suicide outcome measure based on the occurrence of any of 5 types of suicidal behavior
including: (1) death by suicide; (2) suicide attempt; (3) interrupted suicide attempt; (4) aborted suicide attempt;
or (5) preparatory suicidal acts. Following comprehensive baseline clinical, neuropsychological and
neuroimaging assessments all Veterans will subsequently complete 6- and 12-month in-person follow-up
clinical assessments of mood and suicidal behavior. Novel measures of trait impulsivity in this study will include
urgency and impulsive/premeditated aggression. We will assess the relationship between impulsive aggression
and social cognition, functional disability and neurocognitive functioning in BD+S. We will further investigate
two neural circuits tapping state measures of rapid response inhibition (using a go/no-go task) and choice
impulsivity (using a delay discounting task), respectively, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and
neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, which will provide novel measures of fiber arrangement and
neurite density in tracts connecting gray matter regions. Dynamic causal modeling will be used to empirically
test causal models regarding the interaction of brain regions comprising these two circuits respectively.
Machine learning will be used to integrate baseline trait and state measures of impulsivity to longitudinally
predict suicidal behavior over one year. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to investigate the relationship
between trait measures of impulsivity and suicide attempt history in Veterans with bipolar disorder; (2) to
investigate the neural circuitry underlying two models of state impulsivity and their relationship to suicide
attempt history in Veterans with bipolar disorder; and (3) to identify which combination of impulsivity measures
differentiates BD+S from BD-S and HC at a baseline timepoint and can be used to predict suicidal behavior
longitudinally over 1 year."

The ClearWorks respirator, developed by Applied Design Technologies, addresses the critical need for
comfortable and effective respiratory protection for healthcare workers (HCWs) in the face of infectious
diseases, like COVID-19. Current respirators often lack both optimal breathability and a secure seal, causing
discomfort and increased exposure risk. ClearWorks aims to revolutionize this field with its foam half mask
respirator design. The significance of this project lies in protecting HCWs' health and well-being, especially
considering the high mortality rates reported among healthcare workers due to COVID-19. ClearWorks
respirators offer a range of advantages, including exceptional breathability, a universal fit across different head
sizes, transparency for social acceptance and visual speech recognition, lightweight design, reduced CO2
levels, and minimal facial contact pressure. These features are expected to enhance overall comfort and
usability, thereby increasing the likelihood of consistent respirator usage during prolonged shifts, a challenge
reported by many HCWs. With its unique modular component architecture, ClearWorks provides opportunities
for cost-effective upgrades and customization, while its innovative foam seal design and pleated filters
contribute to comfort and breathability. To validate ClearWorks' effectiveness, the prototype will undergo
rigorous testing in this Phase I SBIR, including Fit Factor assessments and resistance testing, adhering to
NIOSH standards. These tests will demonstrate the product's superior performance in ensuring a secure seal
and minimizing breathing resistance. Additionally, third-party validation by a highly regarded testing provider
will provide independent confirmation of the research findings. The ClearWorks respirator project aims to
address a significant gap in respiratory protection for healthcare workers and essential personnel. By
combining innovation in design, materials, and fit, ClearWorks seeks to reshape the landscape of respiratory
protection, ultimately improving the safety and well-being of those on the front lines of infectious disease
control. The product's commercial potential is substantial, targeting the healthcare sector, home health nurses,
and broader essential worker categories."

The purpose of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to support Dr. Lauren Zalla as she transitions
into an independent research career focused on studying the modifiable place-based determinants of health
among people with HIV. The K99 Phase of the award period will be completed at the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Dr. Zalla’s long-term career goal is to design and conduct rigorous epidemiologic research that addresses the
structural determinants of health and health equity among people living with HIV. This award will allow her to
gain expertise in the role of the urban environment in shaping population health, and in methods for evaluating
the effects of neighborhood-level exposures and policy interventions on health and health equity. She will apply
these skills by studying the effects of neighborhood deprivation, residential relocation, and neighborhood
change on care continuum outcomes among people with HIV. The study will be based in Baltimore, Maryland,
a large and diverse “city of neighborhoods” with a history of disinvestment and a disproportionate burden of
HIV. The study will be nested in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (JHHCC), a cohort of individuals
receiving HIV care at the Bartlett Clinic in East Baltimore. The study will address the following specific aims.
Aim 1: Describe the association between neighborhood deprivation and care outcomes among participants in
the JHHCC. To accomplish this aim, individual-level measures of retention in care, viral suppression, and
mortality will be linked to area-level measures of neighborhood deprivation at the census block group level. Aim
2: Estimate the causal effects of residential stability and relocation to lower- or higher-deprivation
neighborhoods on care outcomes among participants in the JHHCC. To accomplish this aim, propensity score
matching will be used to estimate the average causal effects of different residential trajectories on care
outcomes. Aim 3: Quantify the impact of public and private investments in neighborhoods on care outcomes
among participants in the JHHCC. This aim will use a comparative interrupted time series design and g-
methods to estimate the causal effects of neighborhood investments, and will specifically consider the effects
of direct investments by a place-based nonprofit investment fund capitalized by the City and tax incentives to
private developers through the designation of federally-qualified Opportunity Zones.
This project will further our understanding of neighborhood effects on health among people with HIV. In doing
so, it will generate evidence that directly informs the clinical care and supportive services provided to people
with HIV and that shapes public policy aimed at reducing the onward transmission of HIV, improving health
equity among people with HIV, and ultimately Ending the HIV Epidemic."
11009445,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human APOBEC3 enzymes, particularly APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and stable haplotypes of
APOBEC3H, can induce G>A mutations in the HIV-1 genome. Often, these mutations, particularly those inflicted
by APOBEC3G, which is a potent anti-HIV enzyme, generate stop codons and lead to HIV-1 inactivation. Studies
have shown that APOBEC3 enzymes can also induce sub-lethal levels of mutations that lead to HIV-1
diversification and drug resistance. Mutations inflicted by different variants of APOBEC3 enzymes vary
substantially in terms of both their extent and sequence context. For example, APOBEC3H haplotype II often
induces many G>A mutations. By contrast, APOBEC3H haplotype I induces little or no changes in the HIV-1
genome. Analysis of all reported HIV-1 sequences from ~37,000 patients show that the extent and pattern of
viral mutagenesis by APOBEC3 enzymes are highly donor-specific. It is hypothesized that variations in both
APOBEC3 and HIV-1 genes are responsible for the observed differences in viral mutation profiles. The
preliminary data suggest these variations create a complex cascade of patient-specific interactions between HIV-
1 and APOBEC3 enzymes underlying HIV-1 health disparities including responses to antiretroviral treatments.
This proposal aims to integrate diverse viral and host datasets and use a combination of computational and
experimental techniques to identify the molecular determinates of differential viral mutagenesis, and elucidate
their roles in patient-specific responses to antiretroviral therapies."
11020869,"Project Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects over 50 million people worldwide1. For the vast majority
of patients, AD is sporadic, with no known etiology other than advanced age. The field of neuroscience has
understandably focused on cell intrinsic properties of neuronal cells as the basis for neurodegenerative
diseases, such as AD. However, about half of the cells in the brain are glial cells with ~15% of cells in the brain
accounted for by microglia2. Microglia are specialized macrophages of the central nervous system that help to
clear debris, pathogens, and neuronal synapses. Under homeostatic conditions, microglia provide support to
neurons, while under pathological conditions, microglia often prune synapses excessively, activate astrocytes,
increase inflammation, and reduce support to neurons3. Currently, a mechanistic understanding of microglia in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is unclear. To advance the scientific goals of aim 4, this project will study metabolic
neuron-microglia interactions in three-dimensional multicellular cultures. This project will test the hypothesis
that aberrant neuronal PKM2 challenges neuron-glia coupling, and that the microglial capacity to prune and
respond to inflammatory stimuli is influenced by their APOE (Apolipoprotein E) haplotype. The original proposal
indicated that astrocyte activation may be lacking in the absence of microglia to properly activate them. Since,
significant advances have been made in the Gage lab to address this issue through the incorporation of
microglia into organoids (In press, Cell. May 2023), which will complement the microcarrier data and provide a
separate piece of evidence. Metabolic changes in glia by APOE haplotype is well documented4,5, but the
impact on neurons is less clear. It is unknown how APOE ε4 allele influences AD onset and progression or how
APOE ε2 allele provides protection6. This lab has recently acquired commercially available human isogenic
iPSC lines that have been genetically altered to represent each APOE haplotype. Microglia will be generated
from each of these lines as previously described7 and cultured in multi-cell microcarriers and organoids.
Preliminary data from this lab suggests that microglia with APOE4/4 have AD related metabolic defects
associated with lipid metabolism, lysosomal and mitochondrial function. The goal of this project is to analyze
the transcriptome and functionality of microglia with different APOE haplotypes. By employing single cell RNA
sequencing, this project will identify differences in gene expression on a cell-type basis, between these groups.
These data will contribute to the overall proposal and reveal specific genes involved implicated in AD and age-
related lysosomal function and metabolism are downregulated by APOE. Through this mechanism, APOE4
microglia may actively contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, rather than solely reacting to AD pathogenesis.
The hypothesis of this project is that APOE4 microglia will exhibit decreased mitophagy and lysosomal
impairment, therefore increasing toxicity within cells, and ultimately impacting the way APOE4/4 microglia can
provide support to neurons, which this project will investigate through the microcarriers and organoid cultures."

The University at Buffalo (UB) requests funds for critical research renovations and infrastructure upgrades in the
Biomedical Education Building for the construction of a new Gnotobiotic Animal Research. Nearly 700 kinds of
microorganisms exist in the human oral cavity, making it one of the most complex microbial communities in the
human body. The effects of the oral microbiome on human health and pathology has become increasingly clear
over the past two decades, signaling a revolution in perspective regarding how the oral microbiome impacts
human health and disease. The oral microbiome has been associated with diverse disease, including systemic
disease phenotypes from inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer to osteoporosis and cardiovascular and
metabolic diseases. Due to the complexity of the microbiome and the influence of the microbiota on the host and
the host’s effect on the microbial communities, gnotobiotic animal models offer a carefully controlled arena to
interrogate microbiome-specific hypotheses. Using these models, human microbiomes from various disease
states can recapitulate and interface disease states in conventionalized germ-free animal hosts. Using this
approach, we can move from epidemiological association studies in humans into true experimental science
where hypotheses can be generated, tested, and validated producing transformative scientific discoveries.
Currently, the Western New York region lacks a centralized gnotobiotic facility to enable this type of research
and the closest other facilities in New York are located in New York City, almost 400 miles away. This proposal
will convert ~4,000 net sq. ft. of former primate animal research space into a new Gnotobiotic Animal Research
Facility. This facility will be an integral component of the growing UB Microbiome Center that will be accessible
to all research teams from UB, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and other regional universities. This
project will benefit numerous NIH-supported laboratory research programs, including 12 active NIH research
grants totaling approximately $4.6M in annual direct costs, with direct access to germ-free mice and gnotobiotic
facilities in order to advance their scientific discoveries. The goals of this application are to: 1) create a state-of-
the-art gnotobiotic animal research facility and physical home for the UB Microbiome Center Gnotobiotic Animal
Research Facility; 2) offer training for the next generation of scientists in the use gnotobiotic animals to allow
them to take the technologies and experiences into their next career phase; and 3) ensure a safe and appropriate
environment to support NIH-funded investigators and research programs focused on microbiome research on
all three UB campuses, at nearby Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, and other regional/national
universities. Planning was developed in consultation with architectural and engineering firms with extensive
experience in biomedical laboratory design and green design principles. The Project Management Team
includes the Senior Associate Dean for Research (PI), Director of Veterinary and Laboratory Animal Services
(Facilities Manager), and Assistant Director, Facilities Design & Construction (Project Manager)."

The underlying mechanisms that drive resiliency or, conversely, rapid decline, remain unclear. Moreover, models
of human aging, longevity, and resilience to disease that allow for the functional testing of potential interventions
are virtually non-existent. To directly address these gaps in understanding, we propose to build and harness
novel, complementary, in vitro human cellular models created from the fibroblasts and/or Peripheral Blood
Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of healthy young and old subjects and those experiencing mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) or clinically verified Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). We will also study and compare
cells generated from individuals who display exceptional longevity (EL) and/or resistance to or resilience against
ADRD. First (1), in combinatorial efforts, fibroblasts and PBMCs will be reprogrammed into iPSCs and
differentiated into neurons (iPSC-derived neurons) while, in parallel, the same starting material will undergo
direct conversion into induced neurons (iNs) which retain aging-associated signatures. Using this approach, we
harness both the flexibility and unlimited cell source provided by iPSCs while also capturing potential epigenetic
drivers of longevity or resilience by using iNs. Next (2), we will exploit these complementary cell-based models
to identify mechanisms underlying prevention (iPSC model) or reversal (iN model) of aging-related decline
including studies and models of dynamic resilience, DNA repair hotspots, and metabolic functionality. Lastly (3),
we will leverage iPSCs and iNs in functional validation studies of the genes, genetic variants, proteins,
metabolites, and other analytes found to be associated with longevity or decline across all projects in the
Longevity Consortium. These overlapping strategies present a unique opportunity for the cross validation of the
functional results, identified pathways, and signatures observed across systems and laboratories, a major point
of concern in the rapidly emerging geroscience field. This work combines innovative, complementary human
cell-based models capable of recapitulating human development with next generation omics and functional
assays to identify and validate the transcription factors, signaling pathways, and protein interaction networks that
are linked to longevity and act to sustain cellular integrity and functionality during disease and in old age. The
described work, to be performed by a collaborative team of uniquely skilled individuals, has the potential to make
substantial and meaningful advances in the fields of regenerative medicine and aging while unlocking a detailed
roadmap to healthful living and longevity."

Impairments in language development are common in children with autism and can have a profound influence
on their future developmental outcomes and quality of life. There is great variability in both language ability at
the time of autism diagnosis and in the rate of language gains during preschool years. Importantly, language
ability by early school age is one of the best predictors of future academic success, behavioral functioning, and
independence. However, our understanding of factors, including underlying neurobiological mechanisms,
impacting early language development in autism is limited, reducing our ability to develop effective
interventions and improve outcomes. Through harmonization of longitudinal and cross-sectional data collected
from 165 autistic children across four studies, the proposed secondary analysis aims to identify early EEG
indices of delays in language acquisition in ASD, and identify neurobiological, behavioral, and
environmental factors that prevent or promote further language gains. The goal of using this approach is
to identify specific mechanistic factors that impede language early language acquisition in autism. To do this
we will use neuroimaging data, language assessments, and natural language samples collected during early
development to (1) Characterize resting state electrophysiological differences in autistic children with and
without language impairment at 2–3 years of age; (2) Identify early neural markers that predict limited language
gains in ASD; and (3) Identify and characterize neurobiological, behavioral, and environmental factors that
predict greater language gains in 2-year-olds with ASD.
In alignment with the goals of the NIH Tackling Acquisition of Language in Kids (TALK) initiative, this proposal
leverages existing longitudinal and cross-sectional data sets to understand developmental trajectories of late
talking children with autism. Research activities include harmonization of EEG processing and behavioral
measures across multiple data sets, additional transcription and behavioral coding of parent-child interactions,
and re-consenting participants to make data available to NIH data repositories.
Results from this study will advance our understanding of neurodevelopmental pathways preventing or
promoting language development in autism and inform new methods for early detection and therapeutic
intervention."
11033261,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The aim of this project is to acquire a Particle Metrix ZetaView QUATT to characterize small vesicles and
particles by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The University of Delaware (UD) Bio-Imaging Center and its
satellite Flow Cytometry Core currently provide nanoparticle characterization of extracellular vesicles (EVs),
viruses, virus-like particles, and other nanoparticles used for drug delivery with electron microscopy and flow
cytometry. These approaches are invariably complemented and/or validated by NTA to determine size
distribution, concentration, and zeta-potential. Despite the ubiquity of the NTA approach, there are currently no
NTA systems in a fee-for-service core facility in Delaware. This project aims to fill this critical gap in capabilities
by placing the ZetaView NTA system in the UD Bio-Imaging Center, which will ensure that it is easily
accessible and well-maintained by core facility staff scientists. Bio-Imaging Center staff will also train users
how to run their own samples on the ZetaView and also provide NTA on the ZetaView as an “add-on” service
for individuals submitting EV or nanoparticle samples for electron microscopy and flow cytometry services.
Therefore, the ZetaView will directly complement recent investments in these technologies and further advance
our ability to support research on EV release in bone marrow cells, cancer cells, pathogenic microbes, and
nanoparticles developed from viruses, assembled peptides, and fabricated nano-vesicles."

DNA metabolic processes including replication, repair, recombination, and telomere maintenance occur on
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). In each of these complex processes, dozens of proteins function together on the
ssDNA template. However, when double-stranded DNA is unwound, the transiently open ssDNA is protected
and coated by the high affinity heterotrimeric ssDNA binding Replication Protein A (RPA). Almost all downstream
DNA processes must first remodel/remove RPA or function alongside to access the ssDNA occluded under RPA.
Formation of RPA-ssDNA complexes trigger the DNA damage checkpoint response and is a key step in
activating most DNA repair and recombination pathways. Thus, in addition to protecting the exposed ssDNA,
RPA functions as a gatekeeper to define functional specificity in DNA maintenance and genomic integrity. The
precise mechanisms of how RPA imparts functional specificity is poorly resolved. Towards addressing this gap
in knowledge, our long-term goals are to answer the following questions: a) RPA physically interacts with over
three dozen DNA processing enzymes. How are these interactions determined, regulated, and prioritized? b)
RPA binds to ssDNA with high affinity (KD <10-10 M). How do DNA metabolic enzymes that bind to ssDNA with
hundred-fold lower affinities remove RPA? c) RPA plays a role in positioning the recruited enzymes (with
appropriate polarity) onto the DNA. What are the structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties that regulate
this process? d) How are the DNA and protein interaction activities of RPA tuned by post translational
modifications such as phosphorylation? RPA achieves functional dexterity through a multi-domained architecture
utilizing several DNA binding and protein-interaction domains connected by flexible linkers. This flexible and
modular architecture enables RPA to adopt a myriad of configurations tailored for specific DNA metabolic roles.
This dynamic plasticity has hindered structural, biochemical, and biophysical investigations of full-length RPA.
Over the past eight years, our group has developed non-canonical amino acid based site-specific fluorescence
labeling tools to investigate the dynamics of the individual domains of RPA. While difficult to accomplish, our
breakthrough enabled us to reestablish how the individual domains of RPA bound, dissociated, and remodeled
during various DNA metabolic processes. The findings were in stark contrast to commonly assumed models for
RPA function and has opened numerous avenues to finally investigate and establish how RPA functions in
specific DNA metabolic processes. For example, we showed that the commonly assumed high-affinity DNA
binding domains of RPA were in fact the most dynamic and not bound to ssDNA in the context of the full-length
protein. Utilizing our powerful biochemical, structural, and biophysical toolkit we here seek to resolve how RPA
functions in the context of nucleosomes, R-loops, telomere, and in other DNA repair pathways."
11031093,"Project Abstract
Black children are at risk for misdiagnosis across categories of disability due to inappropriate assessment
materials and clinicians’ lack of knowledge regarding Black families’ cultural-linguistic practices. Criteria for
identifying children with late language emergence (LLE), otherwise known as late talkers, are based on the
communication norms of middle-upper class, monolingual, white families. Because communication practices
vary across cultures, typical language acquisition may also vary accordingly. Current assessment protocols,
including standardized tests, criterion-referenced measures, and questionnaires, are structured around one
specific culture’s expectations for communication. Without criteria that are consistent with the cultural-linguistic
practices of Black families, Black children are at risk for being mislabeled as a late talker due to a mismatch
between current criteria and their community language practices. The proposed study centers the expertise of
Black caregivers regarding their children identified as late talkers through the use of video-cued ethnography to
gather qualitative data. In addition, quantitative data will be gathered through direct assessment of the children,
which will be compared to the qualitative data. This mixed methods study will (1) characterize Black caregivers’
conceptualization of effective communication and late talking; (2) describe Black caregivers’ experiences and
evaluation of the language assessment process; and (3) investigate the relation between Black caregivers’
conceptualization of effective communication and current assessment protocols for identifying late talkers.
Black caregivers across socioeconomic status who have children identified as late talkers will respond to a
recording of a traditional language assessment of an unknown child and to questions regarding their
conceptualization of language and communication in individual interviews; participate collectively in a focus
group to discuss their experiences with language assessments; and provide real-time commentary as they
observe a language assessment of their own child. Video-cued analysis will be used to identify themes in
individual interview and focus group transcripts. Descriptive analysis will be used to compare caregivers’
qualitative responses to numerical data derived from the language assessment of the children. Emerging
themes across families will inform our understanding of the cultural practices that transcend SES and bear on
Black children’s communication and the evaluation thereof. Caregiver feedback on assessment protocols will
improve clinicians’ use of current assessment protocols with Black families and clinicians’ accuracy of their
description of Black children’s communication abilities."

11032546,"Project Summary
Cells sharing a common genome transcribe a subset of their available genes to perform different functions.
Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins contribute to cell specialization by binding and chemically modifying chromatin
around lowly-transcribed genes to further reduce (“silence”) their expression. Although many PcG proteins have
been identified, mystery surrounds the most interesting aspects of their function. The utility of silencing derives
from its selective imposition. However, unknown mechanisms determine when silencing begins or ends during
normal development. Furthermore, how PcG proteins epigenetically associate with different target genes in
different cells is poorly understood. It is important to resolve these questions because silencing mistakes disrupt
development and contribute to human cancers. The proposed research program uses a new model system,
Drosophila nurse cell differentiation, and new genetic and genomic engineering tools to study how silencing
initiation, maintenance, and reversal are developmentally regulated. The proposed model system overcomes
technical limitations of studying silencing initiation in early embryos and embryonic cell cultures. A new proposed
tool, termed UAS-gene swap, allows genetic substitution of PcG proteins with mutant versions in thousands of
cells, and is compatible with sensitive molecular approaches like ChIPseq. The first proposed research direction
will use UAS-gene swap to identify the interactions between PcG proteins and transcription factors that are
important for establishing or preventing silencing at each potential Polycomb target gene. A second research
direction will explore how a single PcG protein, Scm, is post-translationally regulated to time silencing initiation
in differentiating nurse cells and other developmental contexts. Finally, a third research direction will use a highly-
efficient genome engineering approach to explore how some Polycomb target genes are stably silenced while
others are not. These diverse directions will significantly advance our understanding of how development
regulates Polycomb silencing. They will also generate new tools to study gene expression control in developing
organisms that will be valuable to the broader research community. Lastly, this research program may reveal
potentially conserved mechanisms that regulate early embryonic development and prevent human cancers."
11034747,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Eukaryotic trans-Golgi network (TGN) has been extensively studied for its role as the major sorting
compartment and the center for terminal processing and modifications of newly synthesized proteins. While the
TGN is known for its dynamic nature associated with the constant flux of traffic, whether its structures can be
altered in microbe-eukaryote interactions and the subsequent consequences have remained elusive until
recently. Our previous study has discovered that multiple microbial factors (e.g., bacterial antibiotics nigericin
and gramicidin) are able to induce the disassembly of the TGN into vesicles. These dispersed TGN vesicles
then serve as a signaling platform for the assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3
pathway induces proinflammatory cytokines, and its hyperactivation has been closely associated with a wide
variety of human diseases, including autoimmune diseases, cancers, neurodegeneration, and metabolic
disorders. Importantly, these stimuli do not affect the closely associated cis- and medial-Golgi, indicating that it
is a tightly regulated reorganization event specifically targeting the TGN. Dissection of the detailed cellular and
molecular basis has been challenging because these stimuli are either small molecules or nonribosomal
peptides not encoded by genes. Recently, we have discovered two groups of microbial factors, i.e., pore-
forming toxins from bacteria and viroporins from viruses, as highly specific TGN-dispersing stimuli. The protein
nature of these stimuli has allowed us to easily track their translocation and genetically manipulate them to
study the effects on TGN remodeling. In addition, we found evidence that TGN remodeling is not only
important for inflammatory signaling, but also results in altered glycosylations. The ultimate goal of this MIRA
R35 proposal is to use these protein microbial factors as tools to study the detailed mechanisms and functions
of TGN remodeling. We will pursue three major questions: (1) What are the regions/motifs that are critical for
these stimuli to remodel the TGN? Our identification of novel TGN dispersion peptide motifs will greatly
facilitate future screening and identification of other TGN dispersion ligands in both microbes and eukaryotic
organisms. (2) What eukaryotic factors (e.g., TGN-localized GTPases and golgin family proteins) are involved
in TGN remodeling, and how conserved are their functions in other eukaryotic species such as yeast? (3) How
does TGN remodeling affect various eukaryotic cellular processes, including inflammatory signaling and
proteins modifications? Our proposed studies will help fill a critical knowledge gap on the mechanisms and
functions of TGN remodeling, as well as providing invaluable insights into the rational design of innovative
therapeutics to mitigate a wide range of human health problems."

Cells rely on precise sensing and prompt responses to mechanical and osmotic changes to maintain
functionality and survival. Recent breakthroughs, including the identification of mechanosensitive and
osmo-sensitive ion channels, have revolutionized our understanding of cellular responses to these
stimuli. Despite this, the pathophysiological mechanisms of these processes in disease remain
elusive. In this application, we aim to address this knowledge gap by creating a mouse model with a
human gain-of-function V44M mutation of TMEM63B, a newly discovered mechano- and osmo-sensing
ion channel. The V44M TMEM63B channelopathy is associated with a diverse range of human
symptoms, including epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, and distinctive blood cell disorders. Our
preliminary studies revealed an unexpected trait of the V44M mutation. This channelopathy mutation not
only alter the ion channel activity of TMEM63B but also bestows a novel function that has been lost in
TMEM63 proteins during evolution. Specifically, the V44M mutation enables lipid scrambling - the
bidirectional translocation of lipids across cell membranes. This function is reminiscent of the capabilities
seen in TMEM63B's evolutionary cousins, the TMEM16 lipid scramblases. To explore the in vivo
implications of this mutation in human diseases, we propose creating a TMEM63B-V44M knockin
mouse with controlled cell-type specific expression. This model will allow specifically dissect the
mutated ion channel's role and its newfound lipid transport property across various cell types and
disease contexts. Post-validation with our robust functional assays in this application, this mouse line
will be made available to researchers across diverse disciplines including hematology, neurobiology,
and more. This pioneering TMEM63B channelopathy mouse model will be invaluable to uncover the
unknown pathophysiology of this mysterious mechano- and osmo-sensing ion channels in health and
disease and shine light on therapeutics to treat TMEM63B related diseases."

 The major hurdle in developing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy for T-cell malignancies is
CAR-T cell fratricide by self-killing, which leads to insufficient numbers of CAR-T cells for infusion. CRISPR-
mediated genomic editing provides an alternative approach to enabling expansion of CAR transduced T cells
from allogeneic healthy donors. However, the safety and clinical implications of CRISPR-based gene editing
remain lingering. The objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to develop a non-edited, CD7 CAR-modified
allogeneic invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cell product for the treatment of relapsed and refractory patients
with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The rationale for this
study is based on our strong preliminary data. We propose two Specific Aims. Aim 1: To optimize the iNKT
cell primary stimulation for maximal proliferation and CAR transduction. We plan to test major
commercially available T-cell activation reagents, i.e., T-Cell Activation/Expansion kit (CD2/CD3/CD28
microbeads), T-Cell TransAct (CD3/CD28 microbeads), and CD3/CD28 Dynabeads in primary stimulation and
transduce them with lentivirus CD7 CAR. CD7 CAR-modified iNKT, control CD19 CAR-modified iNKT or mock
cells will be evaluated for cytotoxicity and IFN-? production against CD7+ T-ALL and AML, CD19+ B-cell tumor
cells, and ?GalCer pulsed CD1d+ target cells. In addition, expansion rate, CAR expression, and expression of
CD3 and invariant T-cell receptor (iTCR) will also be assessed. CD7 CAR-modified iNKT cells with a highest
expansion and CAR transduction while maintaining iNKT cell function and phenotype in primary culture will be
examined for expansion in secondary stimulation. Expanded final cell products will be characterized for their
expansion rate, cytotoxicity, cytokine profiling, phenotype, and expression of checkpoint receptors. Aim 2: To
determine the effect of IL-7 co-expression on enhancing CD7 CAR-modified iNKT cell survival and
efficacy. To test our hypothesis that IL-7 co-expression in CD7 CAR-modified iNKT cells can enhance their
survival and anti-tumor efficacy, we will initially examine IL-7 and/or IL-15 co-expression in CD7 CAR-modified
iNKT cells in response to CD7+ or CD7- tumor cells and characterize 1) secreted IL-7 and/or IL-15 levels, 2)
STAT5 phosphorylation to reflect IL-7 and IL-15 signaling, 3) cytotoxicity and IFN-? release, 4) fold expansion,
5) quantification of antiapoptotic factors (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, MCI-1), 6) serial tumor challenge assay to assess
enhanced survival, 7) frequency of naïve, central and effector memory T cell subsets, and 8) expression of
checkpoint receptors (PD-1, CTLA4, TIM3, LAG3). We will then evaluate their anti-tumor efficacy in our
established aggressive T-ALL xenograft model as assessed by reduced tumor mass via bioluminescence
imaging and prolonged survival. iNKT cell survival will also be assessed by flow cytometry."
11020490,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dogma in the cardiovascular field argues that the adult mammalian heart is essentially non-regenerative and
that this failure to regenerate is primarily attributed to the post-mitotic and polyploid nature of most
cardiomyocytes (CMs). Multiple pieces of evidence now support the idea that within the adult mammalian
myocardium, mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes (MNDCMs) are a privileged subpopulation of CMs that have
avoided this proliferative senescence. This attribute confers a unique capacity to re-enter the cell cycle and
regenerate myocardial tissue. Our recent work in mice demonstrates that the frequency of MNDCMs and the
competence to regenerate one's heart are two interlinked and variable traits influenced by the complex genetic
background of an individual. In other words, contrary to longstanding beliefs, some individuals can mount a
meaningful regenerative response after an insult, such as a myocardial infarction. We then took a genome-
wide association strategy to identify the genes associated with the observed variation. From this analysis, we
identified Tnni3k as one candidate that regulates CM senescence by inhibiting cytokinesis, specifically. Here,
we identify two new candidate genes each of which has a unique effect on CM cell cycle and ploidy.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that identified genes will work cooperatively to maximize the trait effect, thus a
multifactorial approach to heart regeneration is prudent. Aim 1 will explore the first novel candidate for its
independent effect on heart function and CM cell cycle activity in both uninjured and post-infarction settings. It
will also be tested in combination with Tnni3k. Aim 2 will examine the effect of the second novel candidate on
CM ploidy, cell cycle, and heart regeneration both independently and in combination with Tnni3k. Our prior
GWAS study affirms that CM ploidy and cardiac regeneration are complex phenotypes relying on multiple
genetic loci. Here, we use genetic approaches to modulate multiple candidate genes in a single animal model
and we anticipate that this combinatorial approach will potentiate CM proliferation and cardiac regeneration."

This proposal describes a novel concept for acidification of the lysosome and, subsequently, restoration of au-
tophagic flux. Autophagy, the intracellular process by which proteins and organelles are degraded, requires an
acidic lysosome. Failure to acidify the lysosomal compartment leads to accumulation of autophagosomes, lipids,
and associated undigested content. Impaired lysosomal acidification and reduced autophagic flux are central to
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hereafter referred to by its new nomenclature, metabolic-dysfunction
associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The risk factors for developing MASLD increase with advancing age
and, therefore, not surprisingly, MASLD occurs primarily among the middle-aged and the elderly. Current phar-
macological interventions do not target the liver directly to treat MASLD and, instead, affect secondary pathways
or mechanisms (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists to decrease food intake). Key to our advance is the engineering
of a treatment that responds to the pH of a dysfunctional lysosome (pH 5.7 - 6) to release acid and, therein,
further lower the pH to a healthy/normal value (pH 4 - 5). This acid-activated therapy, which we call LysoGen
(short for “lysosomal regeneration”) is composed of polyester-based co-polymers comprising a potent diacid,
tetrafluorosuccinic acid (TFSA). We hypothesize that, upon accumulation in liver lysosomes after intrave-
nous administration, LysoGen will release acid, thereby restoring lysosomal acidity and autophagic flux,
as well as rescuing functional and histological hallmarks of MASLD, such as improved glucose/insulin
tolerance and reduced lipid droplet accumulation in the liver. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the ex-
tent of restoration will depend on the LysoGen polymer composition and dosing regimen. Importantly,
substantial preliminary data support the proposed studies, well-characterized materials and rigorous experi-
mental designs are established, and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise (polymer chemis-
try, biomaterials, cell metabolism, autophagy, and MASLD) are in place to address these hypotheses. LysoGen
provides an unprecedented opportunity to treat MASLD with a first-of-its-kind therapy. Herein, we seek to in-
crease our understanding of this new technology and its impact on the biology and pathology of the MASLD
disease state as well as elucidate and optimize this approach as a prelude to future clinical translation. The
specific aims of this five-year proposal include: Aim 1. Synthesize and characterize LysoGen polymers that
activate at pH 6 and are targeted to lysosomes; Aim 2. Determine the in vitro bioavailability and resulting bioac-
tivity of LysoGen; and, Aim 3. Evaluate the toxicity, biodistribution and efficacy of the optimized LysoGen formu-
lation in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MASLD mouse model."
11031009,"Late talking in toddlers is not only a common reason for pediatrician concern and referral for developmental
evaluation, but it can be a precursor of either persistent language disorder; worsening functional ability such as
autism or global delay; or, oddly enough, the opposite: a neurotypical outcome. Yet, predictors of such
dramatically divergent, heterogenous outcomes remain elusive. Literature reviews reveal substantial lack of
replication in the field, even among the strongest findings, perhaps because many studies tend to have samples
too small to address heterogenous trajectories; use non-comparable ascertainment and recruitment; and engage
limited language, clinical, social, and neurobehavioral assessments. In contrast, our existent sample: (a) is very
large and includes N=1,667 toddlers (552 late talkers), (702 ASD) and (413 typical); (b) were all ascertained,
recruited and clinically characterized in a uniform procedure by licensed clinical psychologists; (c) is
representative of the spectrum of late talkers and typical toddlers; and (d) were longitudinally phenotyped at
toddler (mean age 20 months) and preschool ages (mean age 36 months) using the same language and clinical
tests. In our sample of N=552 late talking toddlers defined using a cut-off of expressive language (EL) < -1 SD,
51% had persistent expressive language delays or worsening language outcomes such as ASD or global delay
by preschool. Yet, 49% of our late talkers made rapid and substantial expressive language advances, achieving
neurotypical levels by preschool. AIM 1 will leverage this unique sample to identify toddler-age precursors
predictive of one of 5 divergent language & clinical outcomes at preschool ages (Transient EL Delay; Persistent
EL Delay; Conversion to LD; Conversion to GDD; Conversion to ASD). Nine commonly reported predictors of
expressive language outcomes will be analyzed using linear regression specifically: receptive language ability
at intake; expressive vocabulary size at intake; % nouns and shape nouns in vocabulary composition; SES, sex,
socialization, mean length of utterance (MLU) and % verbal initiations. Multinomial logistic regression will
determine which of the toddler-age variables are most strongly associated with clinical and language outcome
group membership. Change across time for each measure within each outcome group will also be analyzed.
AIM 2: Social and language development are inextricably linked, and measures of attention to social speech
such as motherese and social images have been shown to be associated with language ability. To go beyond
commonly examined predictors, AIM 2 will leverage previously collected eye tracking (ET) data of auditory and
visual social attention in late talking, ASD, and TD toddlers. Using our large TD sample, reference standards for
levels of social auditory and social visual attention based on 7 key metrics (e.g., level of attention to motherese
speech) across 2-month age bands will be created. Deviations from these norms will be used to reveal novel
predictors of preschool outcomes. Using unsupervised Similarity Network Fusion, multimodality late talker ET-
clinical subtypes will be defined, and predictors associated with each subtype identified."

The Arizona Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Arizona PRAMS) proposes to
conduct a state-specific, population-based surveillance system of maternal behaviors and
experiences before, during, and after pregnancy. Sponsored and partially funded by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, Arizona PRAMS will supplement vital records data by
providing state-specific data to be used for planning and evaluating preconception, pregnancy
and postpartum maternal and infant health programs at the Arizona Department of Health
Services. The 2021-2026 grant cycle will mark the second application submission of the Arizona
PRAMS Program.
Arizona PRAMS will utilize a mixed-mode survey to incorporate both mail and phone systems to
increase response rates. A random sample of mothers will be drawn each month from the
Arizona Birth Certificate Database. These mothers will be mailed Arizona PRAMS
questionnaires that contain questions asking about their preconception, pregnancy and
postpartum experience including risk behaviors, pregnancy intention, access to health care,
maternal and infant nutrition, and mental health. ADHS will utilize bilingual telephone
interviewers to call mothers who do not respond by mail. The Arizona PRAMS survey will
include core surveillance questions that have been developed by the CDC and additional state-
developed questions to explore the determinants of maternal health unique in Arizona’s diverse
population. The survey is estimated to take approximately 20 minutes to complete. In order to
increase response rates, a small incentive or reward will be provided to the targeted mother.
The CDC has established a goal response rate of 55 percent.
Preconception and reproductive health and health equity are priorities of the ADHS Bureau of
Women’s and Children’s Health (BWCH). Arizona PRAMS will provide robust surveillance data

used to monitor the reproductive health of all of Arizona’s women."
11032220,"Chromosome segregation during sexual reproduction places one chromosome, either the maternal or paternal
copy, in each gamete. Accurate meiotic chromosome segregation requires that the parental chromosomes
interact with one another and exchange genetic information through the formation of crossovers. Mis-regulated
chromosomal interactions could lead to karyotype rearrangement and chromosomal mis-segregation, and
consequently to infertility and congenital birth defects. Indeed, crossover formation is tightly regulated on both
local and chromosome-wide scales. The research proposed here addresses the mechanisms regulating
chromosomal interactions by using nematodes and budding yeast, and by developing new experimental
approaches suited to study chromosomal processes that are regulated on large scales.
This proposal probes two aspects of chromosome organization and dynamics. The first part addresses the role
of the synaptonemal complex, a conserved interface that assembles between the parental chromosomes and
regulates the distribution of crossovers. This work builds on the recent understanding that the synaptonemal
complex, despite its ordered appearance when visualized by electron microscopy, is a liquid-like compartment.
By applying genetic approaches, evolutionary analysis, single-molecule tracking and cutting-edge microscopy,
the research aims to understand how the ultrastructure and liquid properties of the synaptonemal complex allow
it to assemble onto the parental chromosomes and regulate crossovers on a large scale. Specifically, how do
protein-protein interactions and the conserved coiled-coil domains in synaptonemal complex proteins generate
an ordered, 3-dimensional structure that nonetheless has liquid properties such as constant subunit exchange?
And, what is the molecular mechanism that regulates loading of a liquid-crystalline synaptonemal complex onto
meiotic chromosomes, aligning all of them from end to end?
The second part addresses the organization of the parental chromosomes and the sister chromatids during
sexual reproduction. These large bundles of chromatin form distinct cytological entities that can nonetheless
undergo precise exchange of information – a necessary step to successfully pass genomes from one generation
to the next. An approach developed in the lab to label only one of the two identical sister chromatids will allow
probing of the differentiation of the sisters from one another. This is important, since formation of crossovers –
which exchange information between the parental chromosomes – involves regulated avoidance the sister
chromatid. The lab is also developing a novel approach to obtain a single-molecule, high-resolution description
of chromosome conformation and dynamics by utilizing an emerging technology to sequence very long
molecules of DNA. Applying this approach to chromosomes during sexual reproduction – when chromosomes
are organized as an array of chromatin loops – will shed light on the mechanisms that align the parental
chromosomes, keeping them in register and allowing them to accurately exchange information."
11032561,"Reproduction in flowering plants depends on multiple male (pollen)-female (pistil) interactive steps to
deliver sperm, which are non-motile and transported as cytoplasmic cargos by the pollen tube through
several specialized pistil tissues to the female target for fertilization, leading to seed production. The
proposed research addresses key cell-cell communicative events in three distinct prezygotic (i.e. prior to
sperm-egg fusion) phases during the pollen/pollen tube journey in the pistil to enable fertilization. Long-
term efforts in our lab have set discovery milestones for the field and recently elucidated key molecular
players in each of these phases, providing critical advances and unprecedented opportunities for the
mechanistic dissection proposed here. The pistil supports pollen germination on its receptive surface, the
stigma, to produce a pollen tube that grows inside the transmitting tissue to reach the target egg-bearing
chamber, the female gametophyte located inside an ovule. Once arriving at the female gametophyte, the
pollen tube burst, releasing sperm for fertilization, producing seed. The pistil also set up barriers to ward
off unwanted mates or invasive disease agents, and to effectively prevent multiple pollen tubes from
penetrating the same female gametophyte to suppress polyspermy and ensure progeny health. We
discovered three related signaling modules, each critical for one the three prezygotic phases. Phase 1
supports pollen germination on the stigma. Phase 2 achieves two goals, one ensuring pollen tube integrity
until it reaches its target, the other ensuring single pollen tube entry into an ovule. Phase 3 occurs at the
pollen tube/ovule and pollen tube/female gametophyte interfaces. Interactions here induce bursting of
the first-arriving pollen tube in the female gametophyte and trigger a mechanism for a local polyspermy
block to further ensure against supernumerary pollen tube entry into an already penetrated female
gametophyte. These signaling modules are anchored by the pistil-expressed receptor kinase FERONIA
or pollen-expressed homologs, each partnering with a GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) LORELEI (LRE)
or LRE-like GPI-AP1,2,3 (LLG1,2,3) to serve as coreceptors for peptide ligands called RALFs (Rapid
Alkalinization Factors). Here we propose experiments to elucidate how these signaling modules and
additional regulatory factors impact the molecular interactions, biochemical processes and cellular
conditions in pistillate cells to mediate success for these prezygotic phases, enabling fertilization, and to
prevent unwanted intrusions. Plants have evolved but hidden in the most protected location these highly
sophisticated cell-cell communication strategies to ensure their own proliferation. Our expertise positions
us uniquely capable of achieving these goals, which will fill a complete mechanistic void, setting
paradigms to guide studies in many ecologically and agriculturally important plants, and inform rational
designs to safe-guard reproductive success, ensuring food security to provide for global nutritional needs."
11032572,"Project Summary:
 Aptamers are biomolecular entities that can bind to a target molecule with high selectivity, which makes
them attractive constructs with potential applications as therapeutic tools, in biosensing, or as materials,
among others. The proposal associated with this supplement submission focuses on the use of a chemical
modification, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoG), as a building block for the discovery of aptamers of RNA
with enhanced specificities and unique structural motifs. Therefore, the use of instrumentation/methodology
that characterizes interactions between the designed aptamers and their potential targets, is of utmost
importance. Some of the common techniques, that are used by the scientific community, include isothermal
titration calorimetry (ITC), microscale thermophoresis (MST), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and
electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Amongst these, the PI opted for ITC as the instrumentation of
choice. Advantage of this technique, over the other, include that 1) there is no need for chemical labeling of
the RNA construct, e.g., with fluorophores, radiolabels, or biotin; 2) the potential to recover the aptamer of
interest; 3) the possibility to extract thermodynamic data, stoichiometry, and affinity strength; and 4) price
accessibility, compared to MST and SPR. It is worth noting that this is a well-accepted technique, in the
community, and that the data that can be extrapolated is of value, to learn about the novel RNA constructs that
will be obtained.
 The addition of this instrument, to the PI's research facilities, will expedite the research progress/activities and
 ensure that the proposed goals are met in a timely and efficient manner. Furthermore, improving the PI's
 laboratory infrastructure will provide hands-on experience, and high-quality training to all students involved in
 this research enterprise.
 As mentioned, the instrument will be used to characterize RNA-metabolite interactions. In addition,
structural information, will be obtained by recording the thermodynamic parameters on suitable RNA
constructs, that will provide valuable information about the impact of the oxidative modifications of interest.
 Locating the ITC within the PI's facility will significantly increase the rate at which experiments are being
carried out, currently (the closest ITC instrument, for research purposes, is located at the biophysics core of
the Medical campus, ~ 10 miles away). Importantly, the student population at CU Denver will have access to
this technique, while improving the research infrastructure within the PI's department. Student exposure to this
technique will enhance the training experience, and prepare them better for their next academic/professional
step."
11032587,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Small molecule and protein signals provide a rich vocabulary for cellular communication. The production and
consequences of these signals are exquisitely sensitive to cellular context and microenvironment. Dissecting the
molecular dialogue between cell types is challenging, and new methods are required to address fundamental
questions: What is the downstream biological function of each signaling molecule? How is the biological function
different when molecules are present in mixtures or when different cell types are present in the
microenvironment? How do microbes—like the bacteria and fungi present in our bodies—affect the molecular
landscape? Our lab is developing new tools to probe these questions including (1) microscale co- and
multiculture methods that enable precise positioning of cell types to study cell signaling, (2) specialized culture
platforms for complex human-bacteria-fungal multikingdom culture, (3) integration of microbial co- and
multiculture systems with volatile organic compound (VOC) sampling to study how volatiles mediate microbial
dialogue, and (4) at-home biofluid sampling and stabilization platforms to probe the human immune response
over time. The present proposal expands our lab’s capabilities in areas (1) and (3), with the possibility to extend
to (2) and (4) in future work. This proposal will probe unanswered questions in two areas of human cell signaling:
(i) paracrine signaling between eosinophils and fibroblasts and (ii) paracrine/physical contact-mediated signaling
between neutrophils, monocytes, and B cells. Further, we will develop novel culture platforms that enable
microbial and multikingdom (e.g., bacteria, fungi) VOC communication and integrated sampling for gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. This culture system will, for the first time, enable
controlled spatial positioning of multiple microbial cultures, a user-friendly setup that can be operated with simple
pipettes, fluidic channels to deliver media and chemical stimulation, and integration of solid phase micoextraction
(SPME) fibers for VOC sample collection. Central to this proposal is the use of ‘open’ microfluidics and
spontaneous capillary flow. We are leaders in open microfluidics and have a strong track record of developing
user-friendly, cost-effective methods to perform microscale multiculture experiments within standard well plates
and cultureware familiar to biologists. The proposed work builds on our capabilities and embraces significant
engineering challenges in doing triculture with sensitive primary cells and innovating an entirely new approach
for study VOCs in microbial cultures. The proposed methods will enhance the understanding of the signals
involved in detrimental prolonged inflammation, critical to the development of better therapies for numerous
inflammatory conditions; they will also enable study of microbial communities that are essential to maintaining
human health (commensal microbes) and those that lead to disease (pathogens). Further, the bioengineering
and microfluidic approaches developed will translate to other biomimetic culture platforms and fundamental
signaling investigations."

 This project aims to elucidate the mechanism for allosteric regulation of SIRT1 activity via the N-terminal
domain of SIRT1, a conformationally dynamic region distal to the catalytic core. SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent
protein deacetylase which has been shown to play a significant role in many biological pathways, such as insulin
secretion, tumor formation, lipid metabolism and neurodegeneration. For this reason, SIRT1 has been identified
as a potential therapeutic target. This progress has been hampered by insufficient understanding of the
molecular mechanism of the regulation of SIRT1 activity, as the C-terminal and N-terminal domains within SIRT1
play complicated roles in allosterically affecting SIRT1 activity. The N-terminal domain has been shown to
potentiate SIRT1’s enzyme activity; this region also contains the STAC binding domain (SBD), a binding site for
sirtuin activating compounds (STACs). However, there is limited in vitro biochemistry study regarding the role of
the N-terminal domain in SIRT1 regulation. Our project is focused on understanding the allosteric interactions
between the N-terminal domain and SIRT1’s catalytic core using three independent aims as detailed below that
focus on the substrate-dependent regulation of SIRT1 by resveratrol, the regulation of SIRT1 by other STACs,
and the intramolecular regulation of SIRT1 by motif A, a domain within its N-terminal region.
 Aim 1: Examine the role of complex stability and conformational dynamics in the substrate-sequence
dependent regulation of SIRT1 by resveratrol, a well-studied STAC. We will compare the binding affinity of
resveratrol to SIRT1 in the presence of different substrates, compare the stability of different
SIRT1•substrate•resveratrol complexes, and compare the conformations of different
SIRT1•substrate•resveratrol complexes.
 Aim 2: Explore if other STACs with similar or different structures as resveratrol can also regulate SIRT1 in a
substrate-sequence dependent manner. We will characterize the substrate-sequence dependent effect of other
STACs, namely piceatannol and SRT2104 on SIRT1 activity using enzyme activity assays and binding assays.
 Aim 3: Elucidate the mechanism of intramolecular SIRT1 regulation via motif A, an intrinsically disordered
region in the N-terminus of SIRT1 and the role of phosphorylation in this regulation. We will use enzyme activity
assays and binding assays, complemented by molecular dynamics simulations, to determine the effects of
phosphorylation on motif A’s ability to regulate SIRT1 activity.
 Our studies will afford a more detailed understanding of the allosteric regulation of SIRT1 elicited by the N-
terminal domain. This would clarify how the activity of SIRT1 is altered in various biological pathways and disease
states, guiding a more targeted approach in modulating SIRT1 activity as a therapeutic method."

 Sterols lipids, including cholesterol, are important for mammalian cell physiology. These molecules
modulate the fluidity of biological membranes and are therefore implicated maintaining membrane integrity,
stress tolerance, fusion events, etc. Sterols are also involved in intra- and intercellular signaling and are trafficked
to sub-cellular membranes. Whereas decades of research have provided molecular insights into eukaryotic sterol
synthesis, transport, regulation, and function, similar understanding of sterols is lacking for bacteria and archaea.
While it is thought that archaea do not make or use sterols, some bacteria do make and transport sterols; many
others are known to engage with sterols produced by eukaryotes. These bacteria include the pathogenic
spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi, Treponema pallidum), Mycobacteria, Chlamydia, Rickettsia, and gut
microbiota. For pathogens, the acquisition of sterols from the host is critical as they colonize and construct their
cell envelopes. For gut microbes, interactions with cholesterol can alter the host lipid metabolism, thereby
contributing to cardiometabolic diseases and dyslipidemia. Despite the preponderance of research about
microbial interactions with these lipids, lacking are molecular insights into how the interactions occur and how
they are regulated. We will address this knowledge gap, which we posit will reveal novel targets for therapeutic
interventions in bacterial colonization and aberrant sterol lipid metabolism.
 Given that some bacteria produce sterols de novo, we reasoned that achieving an understanding of sterol
handling in bacteria that make them could reveal insights into their handling in bacteria that use them. We
therefore focused on Methylcoccus capsulatus, a bacterium reported to produce sterols nearly 40 years ago.
Recent studies reported a significant divergence in sterol biosynthesis in M. capsulatus. We have since added
to those reports one showing that sterol trafficking is also substantially different. We identified three proteins that
traffic sterols: BstA, BstB, and BstC. BstA is a member of the resistance nodulation division family of transporters
that work as transporters for a wide range of bacterial metabolites. BstB is a periplasmic binding protein with
homologs involved in phosphonate transport. Finally, BstC is an outer membrane associated lipoprotein
belonging to a family of transporters whose substrates are not known. The overall structures of the Bst proteins
are markedly different from eukaryotic sterol transporters. However, they all contain ligand sites that are similar
in the presentation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. We posit that a modified structural genomics
approach wherein the focus is on ligand sites instead of overall structure/sequence would enable the
identification of functionally homologous proteins in bacteria. This work will use bioinformatics, quantitative ligand
binding analyses, and structural approaches to identify and characterize sterol trafficking proteins in bacteria that
make sterols, pathogens that hijack sterols, and gut flora that modulate host sterol metabolism."

This proposal examines the mitofusin proteins, which catalyze both mitochondrial tethering and outer
membrane fusion. Mitochondrial shape is central to mitochondrial function and is closely linked to changes in
cellular physiology during development, stress, and aging. Mitochondrial fusion increases metabolic production,
protects against excessive degradation of mitochondria, reduces sensitivity of the cell to apoptotic stimuli and
allows functional complementation of damaged organelles. Compromised mitochondrial function and
decreased organelle connectivity are associated with neurodegeneration and other age-related diseases.
Furthermore, mutations in the genes encoding components of the mitochondrial fusion machine cause
peripheral neuropathy, optic atrophy, myopathy and ataxia. Both mitochondrial division and mitochondrial
fusion are mediated by conserved dynamin superfamily proteins. This diverse family of mechanochemical
GTPases couple self-assembly and conformational changes to membrane remodeling events throughout the
cell. Mitofusin is the mitochondrial outer membrane fusion machine and must assemble both in cis within a
single membrane, and in trans across two mitochondria. The molecular details, including of the composition of
these assemblies, the regulation of their formation and how they contribute to membrane tethering and fusion
are not known. We address these gaps in knowledge utilizing biochemical analyses of mitofusin function. In
Aim 1, we will elucidate mechanisms of allosteric regulation that control assembly of mitofusin into fusion-
competent complexes. Our collection of functional variants and novel approaches will provide a powerful tool
in dissecting the contribution of each mitofusin functional domain to cis oligomerization and trans complex
formation. Our work characterizing CMT2A-associated variants of mitofusin revealed that molecular defects of
mitofusin can be compensated for by cytosolic factors in cells. In Aim 2, we use a reductionist approach that
combines cell biology, biochemistry, and reconstituted assays developed in my lab to determine how the
cytosolic mitofusin effector Bax alters mitofusin assembly to regulate mitochondrial fusion. This research
program draws on our strengths in cellular and biochemical analysis of mitochondrial biology and will yield
fundamental insights not only for mitochondrial dynamics but for the mechanisms through which dynamin
superfamily proteins in general operate."
11036134,"ABSTRACT
One of the greatest mysteries in biology concerns how life has perpetuated, and continues to perpetuate, from
generation to generation. A key feature of the mammalian germline is its sexual dimorphism: spermatogenesis
and oogenesis. These dimorphic developmental processes are inherently complex, and this complexity poses
significant challenges to understanding the perpetuity of life and the development of treatments for various
germline-derived genetic and epigenetic diseases. Thus, in this R35 application, our research directions
converge to address the following question: How do epigenetic mechanisms govern distinct sexually
dimorphic processes in spermatogenesis and oogenesis, culminating in the generation of functional
sperm and eggs? Since I became independent ten years ago, I and my team have worked to construct a
detailed picture of the epigenetic mechanisms that govern mammalian spermatogenesis. We have shown that
the mitosis-to-meiosis transition in germ cell development is notable for not only global changes in gene
expression but the dynamic reorganization of the epigenome; in brief, we have revealed that meiosis itself is a
process of global epigenomic reprogramming. My research program has pioneered these concepts and
developed innovative approaches to decode germline mechanisms crucial for preparing the next generation,
providing a rigorous foundation for future research.
 To understand key sexually dimorphic processes, we focus on fundamental processes in
spermatogenesis and oogenesis. In spermatogenesis, postnatal germ cells enter a stem cell stage, undergo
meiosis, and sustain long-term production of sperm. We will elucidate the global epigenetic mechanisms
underlying spermatogenesis from the stem cell stage to sperm production, with an emphasis on
dynamic changes in the epigenetic machinery and their importance to the next generation. Since, in males,
meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) functions as a key sexually dimorphic process, we will also
determine the molecular functions of DNA damage response pathways—which direct MSCI—in the
epigenetic regulation of the sex chromosomes. In contrast, female germ cells undergo meiosis in embryos
and enter a prolonged stage of meiotic arrest—spanning decades in humans—prior to oocyte maturation. We
will determine epigenetic mechanisms underlying critical stages of oogenesis to complement our study
of male germ cells. Ultimately, we will reveal distinct features and unifying principles of spermatogenesis
and oogenesis. Taking all of this together, we are uniquely positioned to clarify how fundamental germline
mechanisms intersect to ensure genome maintenance, genome defense, and epigenetic gene regulation on a
systemic level. The research directions proposed in this application are cohesive and synergistic, with high
potential to sustain research progress and inform significant, transformative advances in germline biology,
human reproduction, and reproductive health in general."

 The desmosome is a proteinaceous cell-cell adherence structure that is only
found in tissues that undergo significant mechanical stress. One of its main functions is
to connect the intermediate filament latticework of adjacent cells. Desmoplakin (DSP) is
one of the central structural proteins within the desmosome. At least 80% of
Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (AC) cases are linked to variants in genes that encode
desmosomal proteins and about 5-15% of AC cases are specifically linked to variants in
the gene encoding desmoplakin (dsp). dsp variants are also strongly linked to Skin
Fragility Wooly Hair Syndrome (SFWHS) and Dilated Cardiomyopathy with Wooly Hair
and Keratoderma (DCWHK), two rare diseases characterized by fragile skin or fragile
skin plus cardiomyopathy. Our labs (PI Wright and co-PI Borzok) have previously
worked together to identify and characterize a novel molecular mechanism of
pathogenicity common to all three of these diseases. Namely, we found that a subset of
dsp variants result in the exposure of a usually occluded calpain cleavage site in DSP,
rendering the variant hypersensitive to proteolysis. This results in a loss of cellular DSP
levels, creates nonfunctioning desmosomes, and manifests clinically in weakened tissue
stability. We also previously discovered multiple strategies that can reverse this calpain
hypersensitivity: the introduction of secondary mutations that overlay the calpain
cleavage site, incubation of DSP with antibodies that occlude the calpain cleavage site,
and incubation of DSP with small molecules that block access to the calpain cleavage
site.
 While we have data showing that these strategies to manipulate DSP
degradation are effective, the molecular underpinnings of the strategies have not yet
been thoroughly analyzed. Here, we propose to examine the molecular mechanism of
how these strategies work on the protein level (aim 1). We will also test whether these
strategies are functional within the context of a cell (aim 2). These two aims will define
the parameters of how we can use pharmacological methods to correct a cell adhesive
deficiency."

Services and several other state agencies and stakeholders to inform, develop, and drive
policies and programs to improve the health of mothers and babies. The PRAMS survey asks
questions (via mail or telephone) of recent mothers on health topics, such as access to prenatal

Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for gene expression in all eukaryotes and errors in splicing cause genetic
disorders and many other diseases. A thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms of pre-mRNA
splicing has the potential to provide useful approaches for human disease therapy. The splicing of introns is
carried out through two transesterification reactions catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large RNA/protein
complex composed of five snRNPs (U1, U2, U4, U5, U6) and many non-snRNP related protein factors. The
spliceosome undergoes dramatic changes in a splicing cycle, generating the E, A, Pre-B, B, Bact, B*, C, C*, P,
and ILS complexes. Genetic, biochemical, and structural studies in the past four decades have generated
tremendous information on the mechanism of splicing, but significant knowledge gaps remain. Our goal in the
next 5 years is to use a combination of structural, biochemical, and genetic/genomics approaches to
understand the mechanism and modulation of alternative 5’ ss recognition, the mechanism of exon definition,
and the mechanism and function of transcription and splicing coupling. We envision that these projects will fill
several significant knowledge gaps and advance our understanding of the mechanism of splicing."
11034339,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the universal adaptor molecules necessary to convert the nucleic acid-based genetic
code into protein sequence during protein synthesis (translation) by the ribosome. This process is universally
conserved and fundamental to all life, and, as such, defects in the molecular players of translation, including
tRNAs, result in diverse human diseases. Specific chemical modifications such as methylation are common in
tRNA, but a detailed understanding of the enzymes that incorporate them and their contributions to tRNA function
(and disfunction in disease) have only recently emerged for a few select examples. Since the discovery of the
tRNA methyltransferase (Trm10) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an accumulating body of evidence, including
phenotypes in yeast and a multisymptomatic disease associated with human mutations, has established a
significant role for Trm10 in tRNA biology. To better understand the implications of Trm10 modification, the
mechanisms by which Trm10 family enzymes specifically recognize and act on their substrate tRNA, and the
impact of tRNA modifications on important cellular processes need to be addressed. This project will determine
the molecular basis for Trm10 mechanism and function using a multi-disciplinary approach. Genetic, biochemical
and molecular enzymology approaches will be combined with structural analyses of enzyme-tRNA complexes
using synthetic analogs of the native methyl donor, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, to uniquely identify the role of
Trm10 in the maintenance of a high-quality pool of tRNA. A newly developed vertebrate model for Trm10 function
will enable investigation of previously challenging questions on Trm10's role in the biological function of
multicellular eukaryotes. The studies will be performed in three complementary but independent aims that will:
1) Determine how specific tRNA substrates are selected for modification by yeast and vertebrate Trm10 enzymes
using structural, biochemical and genetic approaches; 2) Assess the molecular basis for and biological
significance of the uniquely conserved vertebrate m1A9 modification exploiting a new vertebrate model for Trm10
function, and 3) Identify tRNA-specific functions for G9 modification in yeast and zebrafish using complementary
genetic approaches in both model species. Collectively, the proposed studies will advance the fields of
enzymology, RNA biochemistry, and tRNA biology by providing mechanistic and biological insight into a tRNA
modification enzyme that is universally conserved among eukaryotes and is critically important for human health,
yet whose molecular mechanism and biological functions are not at all understood. These results will also provide
new insight into the dynamic landscape of tRNA modifications in multicellular eukaryotes."

 Many insects pose major health and economic hazards to humans as common disease
vectors and agricultural pests. Almost all of our present understanding of insect
phototransduction is based on opsin-based photoreception in eyes that mediate image forming
vision. My lab has recently discovered two additional phototransduction mechanisms in
Drosophila. Cryptochrome (CRY) and Rhodopsin 7 (Rh7) expressed in central brain neurons
mediate rapid onset sustained electrophysiological responses in these neurons. CRY and Rh7
light signaling underlie a novel form of non-image forming vision that strongly modulates complex
time-of-day dependent insect behavioral responses to light, including avoidance/attraction
behavioral choice between light and shade and light evoked arousal. While CRY’s mechanism
of action is due to light evoked redox state changes of its flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)
chromophore and Rh7’s mechanism of action is through a G-protein signaling pathway, they
physiologically interact and may form the basis of a true color vision system for non-image forming
vision that discerns specific light spectra. We have extended our study of non-image forming
vision to harmful nocturnal Anopheles gambiae and diurnal Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and find
that CRY1s mediate very distinct time-of-day dependent species specific behavioral light
responses in these mosquitp-o important disease vectors. Remarkably, nocturnal and diurnal
mosquito CRY1s confer mosquito species specific behavioral effects when expressed in all CRY
expressing cells in a cry-null Drosophila genetic background and nocturnal mosquito CRY1 is
significantly more light sensitive than diurnal mosquito CRY1 measured by multiple behavioral
and electrophysiological assays. We will determine the detailed mechanisms that confer species
specific physiological and behavioral light responses for flies and mosquitoes and other insects
using a highly sensitive electrophysiological assay that we have developed that will allow us to
accurately measure redox state changes and biological outputs for light sensitive CRYs and
functional interactions between CRYs and Rh7, in combination with behavioral analysis. Our
custom designed instrumentation allows us to examine CRY spectrally driven redox state
changes in vivo. Present insect control strategies rely heavily on highly toxic pesticides. A far
more environmentally friendly alternative is to make use of light-based behavioral manipulation of
insects in a species specific fashion to attract harmful insect species to traps or to repel them

11035620,"SIGNIFICANCE: G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family of membrane proteins that initiate
cellular responses to a wide range of extracellular signals, like neurotransmitters or hormones, by activating
heterotrimeric G proteins inside cells. This makes GPCRs critical for many physiological processes and their
dysregulation is frequently associated with disease. GPCRs are not only the family of proteins most widely
targeted by clinically approved drugs, with an estimated market value of hundreds of billions of dollars per
year, but also the subject of many ongoing campaigns towards novel therapeutics. Moreover, many GPCRs
still remain understudied and “undrugged”, which has great untapped potential for future drug discovery.
 Despite the biomedical importance of these receptors in physiology and pharmacology, the methodologies
currently used to measure GPCR signaling activity in cells have limitations that hinder progress. One
significant limitation is the use of approaches that compromise the fidelity of the readout because they are too
indirect and/or distort the natural stoichiometry of signaling components. Another significant limitation is that
many of the approaches are only feasible in cells in which gene delivery is easy, limiting their implementation
to a few cell lines instead of more physiologically relevant systems like primary cell cultures.
GOAL: Here, we propose to develop technologies that will allow to measure GPCR signaling activity directly
and in diverse, physiologically-relevant cell systems without introducing major perturbations on the natural
stoichiometry of signaling components. The tools and resources generated in this project will be made
available to other investigators without restrictions.
SYNOPSIS OF AIMS: We will develop two complementary assay platforms based on optical biosensors that
directly detect the activity of heterotrimeric G proteins. In Aim1, we will establish a suite of broadly applicable
“compact” vectors compatible with simple transfection or with viral packaging for the expression of G protein
activity biosensors. In Aim 2, we will validate mouse transgenic lines for the conditional expression of
biosensors of endogenous G protein activity. Collectively, these two platforms will allow the direct assessment
of GPCR signaling activity under native expression conditions, in physiologically relevant cellular systems, and
in formats that enable increased throughput to permit the parallel interrogation of the druggable GPCR-ome.
IMPACT: The achievement of our goal could transform how the large field of research interested in GPCR-
mediated cell communication approaches something as fundamental as measuring signaling activity. The

11035852,"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) represent a significant public health challenge, with increasing
prevalence worldwide. Disproportionately affecting young individuals, gay and bisexual men who have sex with
men (gbMSM), persons with HIV or on HIV prevention medications, and racial and ethnic minorities, effective
prevention strategies are essential. Doxycycline post-exposure prophylaxis (Doxy-PEP) has been shown to
reduce bacterial STIs; however, knowledge gaps remain, and there are concerns about engagement, effective
use, and the potential antimicrobial resistance consequences. This study proposes a threefold approach to
address these questions. (1) Establish a prospective cohort of 300 Doxy-PEP users (Doxy-PEP cohort) to
examine baseline and longitudinal factors mapped to the information-motivation-behavioral skills theoretical
framework and identify factors associated with Doxy-PEP care engagement and effective use. (2) Collect
biological samples from the Doxy-PEP cohort and enroll 100 Doxy-PEP eligible non-users (Control cohort) to
evaluate the impact of antimicrobial resistance in persons taking Doxy-PEP using laboratory methods including
culture and resistance testing and metagenomics. (3) Collect biological samples from up to 600 sexual
partners of the Doxy-PEP and control-cohorts to assess the potential for transmission of bacteria between
sexual partners using comparative genomics. By addressing these aims, the study will provide valuable
insights into the risks, benefits, implementation, and impact of Doxy-PEP, informing future strategies to
optimize engagement and maximize STI incidence reduction while minimizing antimicrobial resistance risks."

The proposed Postdoctoral Research Supplement will provide career development and research activities that
will enable Dr. Boudreaux to establish an independent program of research. Dr. Boudreaux is trained in
exercise physiology and physical activity epidemiology with a long-term goal to build a highly productive,
independently funded laboratory which examines the role of the 24-hour activity cycle in the prevention and
treatment of cardiovascular disease. With aspirations of becoming one of the preeminent investigators in the
field of exercise science and physical activity epidemiology research, Dr. Boudreaux has identified specific
training areas in which more advanced training will allow him to accomplish this goal. As such, he has
assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors to provide training in: (1) physical activity and sleep research
methodology, (2) cardiovascular disease prevention research (3) advanced study design and statistics, (4)
research dissemination and transition to independence, and (5) education in the responsible conduct of
research. For his research project, Dr. Boudreaux will utilize the infrastructure of the parent grant, a phase I/II
dose finding clinical rial designed to identify the minimally effective dose of sedentary breaks to offset the
cardiometabolic harms of prolonged sitting. Participants completed two 8-hour laboratory visits that entail either
a control condition (sitting for 8 hours) or an active condition (sedentary breaks at randomized dose). Building
off the parent grant, the primary aim of the study is to characterize the relationship between the composition of
the 24-hour activity cycle and 24-hour blood pressure in adults. To address this aim, additional assessments
are proposed for participants enrolled in the parent grant study including (1) ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring (2) multi-device accelerometry. The proposed study is designed as a pilot which will allow Dr.
Boudreaux to collect feasibility data for conducting his proposed methods and protocol. Data collected from
this study will be used to inform screening, participation, and dropout rates and to test methods and
procedures for Dr. Boudreaux’s future K grant application wherein a larger and more focused study will be
proposed to investigate the dynamic relationship of the 24-hour activity cycle with blood pressure. Dr.
Boudreaux’s efforts in this Postdoctoral Research Supplement may help to fill a pressing need for identifying
optimal time spent in each component of the 24-hour activity cycle to protect against the harmful
consequences of dysregulation of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure."

11032243,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Proteins drive essential functions of life as well as aberrant functions in disease, making the development
artificial molecules that mimic proteins a significant challenge in biomedical research. The problem of protein
mimicry is rooted in the hierarchy that defines protein structure, where covalent connectivity gives rise to local
folding motifs, unimolecular arrangements of such motifs, and multi-chain assemblies. The construction of
sequence-specific oligomers with artificial backbones and defined folding propensities is a powerful approach
to peptide and protein mimetics. Most precedent with such scaffolds has focused on isolated secondary
structure. Creating more complex tertiary folding patterns presents a formidable challenge, as it requires the
design of both backbone connectivity and side-chain sequence that will result in multiple biomimetic
secondary structures that pack in a defined way in a single chain. Addressing this challenge has the potential
to advance artificial protein-like chains toward the functional versatility of biomacromolecules.
 A unifying theme underlying research in the PI’s laboratory is the design, synthesis, and application of
molecules that are inspired by proteins but expand beyond natural constraints of covalent connectivity. A
major goal in this work, supported in prior awards from NIGMS, has been the development of strategies for
producing protein tertiary structure mimetics from artificial bio-inspired backbones. The central hypothesis
guiding this effort is that any protein can be treated as a chemical entity with two orthogonal sequences: one
of side-chain functional groups and a second of backbone units that display those functional groups.
Systematic engineering of backbone composition in a prototype sequence from nature can yield a
heterogeneous-backbone analogue with similar fold and function. In work to date, design rules have been
conceived for the construction of such agents, the impacts of altered composition on folding examined, and
the functional potential of these molecules explored. The present application seeks to advance this program
through continued effort across four complementary research areas.
 From a practical standpoint, artificial backbone composition can impart useful properties, such as
enhanced biostability, and tune biological activity. In fundamental terms, changing backbone characteristics
in ways not possible with traditional mutagenesis can further understanding of natural biomacromolecules.
An important aspect of the concept underlying the research is that it addresses the problem of tertiary
structure mimicry by an approach that is generalizable, as natural sequences serve as the starting point for
design of their own mimics. Further, while the molecules are synthetic, the design principles are applicable in
the context of new emerging approaches to biological production of protein-like artificial chains."

11034821,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retroelements and spliceosomal introns comprise ~70% of the
human genome. Both of these genetic elements are thought to have evolved from a group II intron ancestor.
Group II introns are catalytic RNAs that are able to engage in both retrotransposition and pre-mRNA splicing.
Group II introns engage in retrotransposition and function as retroelements using a copy-and-paste mechanism
that allows insertion into new locations in DNA genomes using a reverse transcriptase (RT) and an intron RNA
template. Despite the prevalence of retroelements in eukaryotic genomes, relatively little is known about the
precise molecular mechanism of retrotransposition. Group II introns are also ancestral to the splicesome,
which is responsible for catalyzing pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotes. This evolutionary linkage is supported by
the fact that the active site of the group II intron is conserved with that of the spliceosome. Group II introns can
catalyze self-splicing reactions that results in the excision of intron lariat and ligation of the adjacent exons.
There are still many unanswered questions regarding the precise mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing and the
function of highly conserved nucleotides within the active site. Group II introns consist of two major
components that form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex: 1) a self-splicing catalytic RNA and 2) a multi-
functional maturase protein that has RT activity. We have isolated a thermostable group II intron RNP that
exhibits high levels of retrotransposition and splicing activity. Our group II intron complex is very amenable to
high-resolution structure determination and in vitro biochemical studies. To gain mechanistic insight into both
retrotransposition and pre-mRNA splicing, we aim to use single-particle cryo-EM, x-ray crystallography,
genetics and single-molecule approaches to characterize and capture the different stages of catalysis in this
group II intron system. The knowledge gained from these studies will provide direct insight into the
mechanisms of both retroelements and the splicing machinery found in higher eukaryotes. This work also lays
the foundation for the future biochemical and structural investigation of mammalian retroelements. In
summary, the goals of this proposal will further knowledge of the structure and function of genetic elements
that comprise a majority of the human genome."

The long-term goal of my research program is to understand neutrophil heterogeneity and functions in diverse
tissues and biomedical contexts. We have combined high-dimensional and single-cell profiling with integrated
bioinformatics approaches to defining context-specific neutrophil landscape. Neutrophils, the most abundant
human immune cell type, play crucial, first-line roles in regulating swift responses against infections and
pathological responses. Emerging evidence has shown that neutrophil response is systematic and context-
specific with distinct phenotypes and functions. Burn injuries are among the most common traumatic injuries
worldwide. In severe cases, patients can die of infection, shock, and/or organ failure, requiring expeditious
clinical responses. Proper wound healing requires a coordinated time-dependent balance of pro- and anti-
inflammatory immune pathways to prevent irreversible systemic damage. Despite being the first to mobilize to
sites of injury, there remains little known about neutrophil heterogeneity, their fates, and which factors control
the plasticity of neutrophils in wound healing. We hypothesize that neutrophils' cellular and molecular landscape
change over time during the wound healing process, and that blood neutrophils could be a marker to predict
complications and outcomes in severe burn injury. To this end, we will focus on two important discoveries in
neutrophil biology over the past decade: (i) neutrophil heterogeneity and adaption to specific tissue environments
revealed by high-dimensional flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptome data and (ii) neutrophil reverse
migration phenotypes, shown in model organisms demonstrating that neutrophils migrate back to the vasculature
in response to inflammation. In this MIRA application, I plan to 1) identify transcriptional and spatial landscapes
of neutrophils and their interactions with other immune cells in human burns using multimodal single-cell profiling
approaches, 2) define reverse migration neutrophil phenotypes in human burns by performing cross-species
single-cell transcriptome analyses of neutrophil heterogeneity in wound healing using clinical samples and pre-
clinical zebrafish burn models, and 3) develop analysis pipelines and methods to predict neutrophil behaviors
defined by imaging using single-cell genomic data in humans and publicly available data from zebrafish and
mouse models. In the next five years, I will establish a research program to study neutrophil heterogeneity and
plasticity in wound healing using multidisciplinary approaches. Our approaches are innovative because we will
employ: (i) state-of-the-art single-cell technologies, (ii) novel integrated bioinformatics method development and
analysis, and (iii) profiling data cross-tissues in humans with in vivo validation models using model organisms.
These studies will generate comprehensive data and provide cellular and molecular landscapes of neutrophil
heterogeneity to the community studying wound repair and neutrophil biology."

Weak multivalent interactions mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of proteins have been proposed
to spatially organize the transcriptional machinery into multi-component clusters, yet we know little about how
these IDRs interact with specific partners to enable functional outcomes. As these interactions are highly
dynamic and cluster-dependent they have been overlooked by conventional strategies to identify protein-protein
interactions. Our preliminary data support our overarching hypothesis that in the context of higher-order clusters
weak multivalent interactions are capable of highly specific hetero-typic interactions leading to functional
organization of the nucleus. Our long-term objective is to understand how weak multivalent interactions organize
specific components of the transcriptional machinery in order to enable gene activation. The objective of this
grant is to investigate the mechanism and function of cluster-mediated interactions of the IDR of MED1, the
largest subunit of the mediator coactivator complex. Mediator is a megadalton complex that bridges DNA-binding
transcription factors with downstream steps of the activation process requiring it to engage dynamically with
many components of the regulatory machinery. While recent structural studies have revealed the architecture of
this complex, the domains responsible for multivalent interactions are dynamic IDRs and remain unresolved. In
particular the MED1 subunit contains a >600 amino acid c-terminal IDR (MED1-IDR) which previously published
studies implicate in cluster formation. Our preliminary data show that MED1-IDR clusters selectively partition
positive regulators of transcription and exclude negative regulators or functionally unrelated yet abundant nuclear
proteins. These data lead us to hypothesize that IDR-mediated selective compartmentalization is a mechanism
to regulate transcription. To test this hypothesis we will confirm and validate the specificity of these cluster-
mediated interactions (Aim 1), characterize the molecular features underlying specificity of these interactions
(Aim 2), and investigate the function of these interactions in various models of gene activation (Aim 3). Upon
completion of these proposed studies, we will understand the role of weak multivalent interactions mediated by
MED1-IDR in organization of specific components of the transcriptional machinery. This contribution is significant
as it will lead to a new appreciation for the function of the prevalent yet often overlooked IDRs in gene activation.
While we focus here on MED1-IDR, the tools and methods developed and the principles learned here can be
applied to other weak multivalent interactions involved in gene regulation or the growing list of biochemical
process regulated by dynamic clustering of regulators."
11031707,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K08 proposal will address a critical need for evaluating and understanding the implementation of
community health worker (CHW) mental health models to reduce treatment disparities for underserved groups,
specifically, Spanish-speaking Latine parents. The Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) is an
effective transdiagnostic evidence-based treatment (EBT) designed to be delivered by lay providers with little
to no prior mental health training (i.e., CHWs). As members of the community served, CHWs can facilitate
culturally and linguistically relevant services, making them a crucial resource given the shrinking availability of
Spanish services in the U.S. CHWs have demonstrated effectiveness in delivering CETA and other EBTs
globally, but there is little evidence to guide domestic implementation of these models. The goal of this project
is to evaluate the implementation of CHW delivered CETA in Spanish with Latine parents. In Aim 1, the PI will
collaborate with stakeholders to refine CETA fit for a Spanish-speaking Latine parent population. Guided by
ADAPT-ITT, an implementation framework for EBT refinement, a community advisory board (CAB) will lead
refinement around areas of cultural relevance and engagement. Aim 2 will use mixed methods to assess
multilevel implementation determinants during the CETA training period, which includes initial CHW
implementation with training cases, and use this information for ethics-driven implementation planning. Aim 3 is
to conduct a randomized feasibility pilot of CHW-delivered CETA in Spanish with Latine parents to examine
intervention acceptability and feasibility; feasibility of recruitment, randomization, and measurement
procedures; and treatment engagement. Latine parents will be randomized to receive CETA immediately or
after a 5 month delay. Administrative data (i.e., patient attendance, retention), patient-report data (i.e.,
validated mental health symptom measures pre-, during-, and post-treatment), and provider-report data (i.e.,
fidelity) will be used to evaluate feasibility. Dr. Gustafson’s long-term career goal is to evaluate, adapt, and
implement CHW mental health models to reduce disparities in mental health treatment for Latine and other
underserved populations in the U.S. To meet her career objectives and the aims of this research project, the
applicant requires additional training in: 1) community-engaged clinical trials; 2) implementation science, with a
focus on contextual fit optimization; and 3) ethics related to implementing CHW models to address disparities
in care for marginalized communities. Supported by an interdisciplinary team of experts and an institutional
environment invested in supporting innovative initiatives to improve the mental health of marginalized
populations, this K08 will launch the PI into a successful career as an independent clinical scientist. This
project will also provide necessary data for Dr. Gustafson’s future R01 submission of a large-scale
effectiveness-implementation trial of CHW-delivered EBT across multiple clinics and community settings. This
project aligns with NIMH’s priorities of addressing mental health disparities for minority groups."

Project Summary
 Cells migrating in tissues, including cancer cells, use filopodia to guide them through the 3D
environment and increased formation of filopodia correlates strongly with the metastatic
potential and invasiveness of cancer cells. Filopodia are slender actin-filled projections
composed of a core of cross-linked, parallel actin bundles. They are highly dynamic, vary in
length and are found in a wide variety of cell types such as neurons that use them for gradient
sensing and efficient directional migration and cancer cells that employ them for moving out
from tumors into neighboring tissue.
 The first steps of filopodia formation are not well understood. Three conserved proteins are
required for their formation - a MyTH4-FERM myosin (MF; MyTH4 = myosin tail homology 4;
FERM = band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin) and two regulators of actin polymerization, VASP and
Formin. How the action of these three proteins is coordinated to initiate filopodia formation is
unknown. The objective of the parent project is to define the molecular mechanism of filopodia
initiation with an emphasis on the role of a MF myosin in this process. The versatile model
system, Dictyostelium will be used to define how a MF myosin and VASP work together to
organize the fast growing ends of actin filaments at the membrane to initiate polymerization. A
combination of in vivo, in vitro and in silico approaches will be employed to a) determine the
functional relationship between a MF myosin, VASP and formin, b) identify the specific
properties of the myosin motor used for filopodia initiation, c) identify proteins that interact with
the MF myosin to promote cortical targeting during filopod initiation and filopod tip formation and
d) develop a stochastic computational model with predictive power that will inform the
experimental goals, the results of which will be used to refine the model.
 The knowledge generated by the parent project will reveal how cells use a myosin-based
motor to build specific actin-based structures such as filopodia. Understanding how initiation
occurs will also reveal how cells control filopodia formation to enable directed migration or
invasion of surrounding tissues."

Microsatellite expansions cause over 50 neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases, with CAG repeat
expansions being one of the most common classes of disease-causing repeats. CAG repeat expansion
diseases, which include Huntington’s disease (HD), spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and
spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 12, share the production of CAG expansion RNAs and in
most cases, the expression of toxic polyglutamine containing proteins. Despite these shared features, there are
no cross-disease therapeutic approaches and there is a lack a clear understanding of the precise molecular
mechanisms responsible for disease pathogenesis. While current therapeutic approaches focus mostly on
treating symptoms, there are multiple available targets in the pathogenic cascade for these diseases: the CAG
expansion containing gene, expansion transcripts, and/or expansion proteins. Therapeutic approaches in
preclinical development that target this cascade have been largely gene-specific, offering hope for one disease
but not for the larger family of CAG repeat diseases. Our approach of designing therapeutic strategies that
selectively target abundance of CAG RNAs has the potential to alleviate the underlying mechanisms and impact
all downstream aspects of the pathogenic cascade across multiple CAG repeat expansion diseases. Our central
hypothesis for the parent grant is that targeting CAG expansions with small molecules will provide therapeutic
efficacy across multiple CAG SCAs. To this end, we have already identified multiple small molecules that
selectively reduce levels of CAG transcripts across SCA1, SCA3 and SCA7 patient-derived fibroblasts and SCA1
mice providing proof-of-concept for a cross-disease small molecule approach for CAG expansion SCAs. In the
parent grant, we will leverage our established pipeline to identify FDA-approved small molecules and natural
products with therapeutic efficacy across CAG SCAs. This supplement is focused on complementary studies to
investigate the therapeutic potential of our lead candidate small molecules in Huntington’s disease models and
in combination with protein regulating small molecules. By expanding the group of diseases for our novel, RNA
targeting small molecules, Daphne will gain valuable training experience while providing key information as to
whether CAG repeat selective compounds could provide therapeutic benefit beyond the SCAs. Furthermore,
while compounds that target SCA proteins, most notably ATXN3, and the huntingtin protein have been published,
the possibility of an additive effect of small molecules that target both protein and RNA has yet to be considered
for CAG expansion diseases. Therefore, Daphne’s investigation of combination therapeutics for CAG SCAs and
the broader group of CAG expansion diseases has the potential to uncover promising strategies that maximize
therapeutic benefit whilst minimizing off target effects of any individual small molecule therapeutic. This work will
have broad implications for therapeutic development and our understanding of disease across CAG SCAs, non-
CAG SCAs, CAG repeat diseases and the broad class of microsatellite expansion disorders."

In 2021, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV surveillance report indicated that Latinx
communities accounted for 29% of new HIV diagnoses but comprised only 19% of the US population. In that
same year, male-to-male sexual contact accounted for 67% of all new HIV diagnoses. These disparities in HIV
cases have led to the designation of Latinx sexual and gender minority (LSGM) groups as priority populations
in the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Plans, both nationally and locally, and in the Getting to Zero-Illinois
Plan. Reasons for high HIV incidence and prevalence within LSGM communities are multifaceted and
compounded by intersecting sexual and ethnic/racial identities. As preliminary work by our team and others
has shown, lack of trust in health systems may reduce engagement and retention in HIV care and prevention
services, including uptake and adherence to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Moreover, social and
structural factors (e.g., racism, homophobia, stigma) may reinforce and perpetuate medical mistrust and
misinformation in LSGM communities. Unfortunately, little is known about the mechanisms of medical mistrust
and misinformation, particularly from the perspective of LSGM community members, and most research has
focused on individual-level behavioral interventions, thereby neglecting to target medical mistrust as a social
determinant of health. We believe that community- and structural-level interventions are needed to dismantle
medical mistrust and misinformation, and to improve the state of HIV prevention, particularly for engagement in
PrEP healthcare among LSGM. Leveraging our longstanding collaborations with local leaders in Latinx-
focused research and service provision, including partnerships with our local health department, the long-term
goal of this research is to prevent new HIV transmissions among LSGM by improving engagement in HIV
prevention services, including PrEP. To accomplish this goal, we propose the following mixed methods
research aims: 1) understand medical mistrust and misinformation and their impact on PrEP healthcare
engagement (i.e., PrEP Stages of Change) from the perspectives of LSGM, HIV healthcare providers, and
social service providers through interviews and a community-level survey; 2) utilize the ADAPT-ITT framework
to select and tailor a CDC-designated, evidence-based intervention (EBI) for LSGM with a focus on medical
mistrust, medical misinformation, and PrEP healthcare engagement using formative research, focus groups
with LSGM, input from our community advisory board (The Chicago Queer Latina/x/o Collaborative), and
feedback from expert consultants; and 3) conduct an implementation feasibility trial by leveraging
implementation science frameworks (e.g., CFIR) to optimize intervention delivery, assess the acceptability of
the adapted EBI for LSGM, and explore our capacity to collect preliminary outcomes using the RE-AIM
framework. This research is in alignment with the US EHE Plan, and study activities will be conducted in
Chicago and Cook County, IL - one of the 50 EHE jurisdictions."
10863456,"Many cancers exhibit aberrant overexpression of developmental lineage-specific transcription factors. In this project we investigate the potential of exploiting oncogenic overexpressed transcription factors to force cancer cells to produce anti-cancer therapies using a gene therapy strategy. We will design synthetic promoters specifically responsive to transcription factors of interest in different cancers to use in therapeutic vectors as drivers of cancer therapies. As a proof-of-concept, the project will begin with the lineage-specific transcription factor ‘X’ in the context of lung cancer. In lung adenocarcinoma the highly expressed homeobox protein ‘X’ is regularly used as a clinical marker and has been shown to be an oncogenic driver and fundamental to carcinogenesis. The investigation will extend to other lineage-specific transcription factors in different types of cancer, including prostate, breast, melanoma, brain, liver, head and neck, gastric, ovarian, kidney, cervical, pancreas, and Ewing sarcoma. The goal of our proposed aims is to develop a novel science for controlling spatial precision of drug delivery by exploiting a cancer’s transcription factor lineage-addiction to drive production of therapeutics locally. Our preliminary results indicate cancer-specific transgene expression after systemic therapy administration. In our first aim, we propose to study the effect of our gene therapy on cancer growth in a humanized murine model with therapeutic payloads safely used systemically in the clinic. In our second aim, we propose to develop a pipeline for unbiased discovery and validation of synthetic promoters specifically responsive to transcription factors of interest; work that will move beyond proof-of-concept experiments to designing gene therapy strategies for the range of human cancers with transcription factor-mediated growth dependencies."

The primary objective of the Functional Microbiomics, Inflammation, and Pathogenicity (FMIP) CoBRE at the
University of Louisville (UofL) is to establish a comprehensive and interdisciplinary research center focused on

years, we have successfully brought together a group of promising junior investigators, each possessing unique
expertise, and paired them with highly qualified and dedicated mentors. Through a collaborative effort, a cohesive
set of complementary projects has been developed, forging innovative connections between inflammatory
processes and bacterial pathogenicity. This has led to successful graduation of six junior faculty with NIH R01

establishing their own strong scientific programs. These achievements were supported and facilitated by the
Functional Microbiomics Core, which provides essential resources such as germ-free animal facilities, anaerobic

11035853,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The global rate of HIV infection and number of AIDS related deaths have dramatically declined thanks to the
expanding access to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). However, current cART is only able to suppress
acute replication of HIV but fails to eliminate it. HIV epidemic remains unsolved and new HIV infections still occur
at a remarkable rate worldwide. Furthermore, HIV infection, even under control of cART, still persistently
associates with the chronic immune activation that attributes to the significant increase of risk for inflammation-
related diseases and the accelerated aging process. Identification of novel host-HIV interactions critical to HIV
infection will not only improve our understanding of HIV infection courses, but also accelerate the finding of new
strategies to develop antiretroviral agents perturbing host regulatory factors, which can efficiently eliminate HIV,
leading to a HIV/AIDS cure. Following HIV infection, Nef is expressed as one of the earliest and most abundant
viral proteins and important to establishment of HIV persistent infection. Our recent studies have identified that
HIV Nef plays a role in enhancing SUMOylation of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and leading to its nuclear
accumulation. We provided the evidence that depletion or inhibition of PLK1 promotes cell death of HIV-infected
CD4+ T cells and facilitates elimination of HIV reservoirs. In this proposal, we aim to investigate the Nef-PLK1
axis based on our hypothesis that PLK1 is Nef’s host effector that executes its key function to promote cell
survival and immune escape, thus supporting HIV persistent infection. We will investigate the molecular insights
for HIV Nef to activate PLK1 protein SUMOylation and its nuclear accumulation. We will also dissect the signaling
transduction of PLK1 to promote survival and immune escape of HIV reservoir cells. Beyond the fundamental
studies, we will test the potential of small-molecule inhibitors targeting PLK1 as the reagents for elimination HIV
reservoirs. It is well acknowledged that simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques closely
resembles HIV infection of humans, which serves as the best available animal model for studying progression
and pathogenesis of AIDS. We will determine whether the function of Nef-PLK1 axis is conserved in SIV infection.
We will also evaluate whether PLK1 inhibition is potent to eliminate SIV reservoirs. In Aim 1, we will investigate
HIV/SIV Nef’s role in controlling PLK1 protein modifications and functions. In Aim 2, we will determine PLK1’s
role in promoting survival and immune escape of HIV/SIV reservoirs. In Aim 3, we will evaluate therapeutic
potential of PLK1 inhibitors for eliminating HIV/SIV viral reservoirs ex vivo."

(not meeting expressive language milestones between 18-24m) is an often-used marker of PLI risk
(approximately 40% of LT have persistent delays and go on to receive a diagnosis of PLI). To date, research
on LT has identified several factors that are associated with poorer language in the second year, including
demographic, family history, and child neurocognitive variables. However, there is little extant research
focusing on predictors of delayed expressive language in the first year, before the onset of major language
milestones. For the proposed secondary data analysis, we will analyze data from three existing longitudinal
studies conducted in our lab. These projects collectively provide a rich, densely sampled longitudinal dataset
from 2-36m encompassing a diverse sample of children (n>300) with distinct factors (e.g., socioeconomic,
familial history of language disorder or autism) that put them at elevated likelihood of developmental language
delay. From these projects, we have access to a suite of demographic and environmental data, language
measures, resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and videos of parent-child interactions (PCX). We
plan to process EEG data, code PCX videos for language and parenting behaviors, and harmonize variables
across studies to establish a unified dataset to retrospectively investigate the biopsychosocial factors that
contribute to late talking and predict risk for PLI in early infancy. We have identified approximately n=64 late
talkers in this sample and plan to select a group of matched peers who met typical expressive language
milestones at 24m. The specific aims of the project are: 1. To trace longitudinal trajectories of EEG features
from 2-24 months that are associated with late talking. 2. To identify features of the psychosocial environment
with the greatest explanatory power for individual differences in EEG developmental trajectories and language
outcomes at 24 and 36m. Our goal for this project is to establish a comprehensive foundation for identifying the
neural mechanisms and environmental factors associated with language development that may, in
combination, improve predictive models of delay and impairment. In addition, we plan to make this dataset
available on NIH and public databases to facilitate future secondary analyses that may uncover nuanced
patterns in the neurodevelopmental trajectories and psychosocial environments of late talkers."
11031139,"Late language emergence (late talking), affects one in five children in the United States today. Therefore, a
question pediatricians often face at the 24-month well child visit is which late talking children will require specific
assessment and early intervention services to improve their language abilities and long-term outcomes. To
connect the right child with the right early intervention there is an urgent need to identify specific developmental
trajectories associated with late talking. To date, late talking research has mostly relied on data from relatively
small cohort and intervention studies, and included participants who may not be representative of broader
pediatric populations growing up in America today. The use of real world data from electronic health records
(EHR) offer a unique opportunity to address these gaps by studying large, representative cohorts of children,
over longer periods of time to better understand distinct late talking developmental trajectories. While EHR data
has been used to study neurodevelopmental and neurological conditions associated with late language
emergence, only two EHR studies have specifically focused on late talking. These studies have relied on ICD
diagnostic codes to identify the late talking phenotype in EHR records, an approach with inherent weaknesses.
Disparities related to child sex, race, ethnicity, primary home language, and insurance status may result in
delayed capture of ICD diagnostic codes in the medical record. Furthermore, delays may occur between when
parents’ first share concerns with a professional about their child’s development and documentation via an ICD
diagnosis of developmental conditions, including late talking. This study aims to improve how EHR data are used
to study late talking by employing novel machine learning approaches (natural language processing) to identify
late talkers within EHR databases, create open and shared data resources to identify late talking children within
EHR, and leverage inherent advantages of EHR data to delineate late talking developmental trajectories. Our
experienced research team of psychiatrists, language experts, pediatricians, informaticists, and data scientists
are well positioned to achieve our study aims. Our long-term goal is to delineate distant trajectories associated
with late talking, thus enabling a personalized intervention approach to improve child outcomes. In follow-up
work, we will seek to develop a multi-site consortia to study and intervene with late talkers in real world
environments. This will ultimately improve clinical decision-making and referral practices for late talking children."

The cloud module proposed here is focused on applying machine learning (ML) methods for the analysis
of large datasets generated from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of biomolecules. ML has become a
common set of tools used in many areas of scientific research, albeit still with some barriers to their imple-
mentation due in part to a relative dearth of training materials. Thus, the proposed module is especially timely.
The dataset that will be used in the module is derived from long-timescale MD simulations of the SARS-CoV-2
or SARS-CoV spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) bound to the human receptor on the cell surface,
ACE2. The ML approaches covered are logistic regression, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (a type
of neural network). These methods will be used to facilitate the identification of the key residues responsible
for the increase in binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV. The module will guide scientists and
researchers through the different steps for analyzing a large amount of data with ML approaches and gleaning
meaningful insights from them. The aim is to decrease the barrier for students, scientists, and researchers with
a nascent interest in applying ML to problems in quantitative biology. The skills and concepts learned through
the module will facilitate the further implementation of ML approaches in the user’s own research using a
cloud environment. Such approaches can be extended by users to the application of ML for analyzing large
datasets produced in other areas of research, including experimentally. The design of the module is based
on tutorials developed for a recent workshop with participants spanning the full gamut of education levels and
coding experience, illustrating its adaptability, meeting the needs of all users."

11034922,"PROJECT SUMMARY and ABSTRACT
 The vast majority of biological functions use membrane-embedded proteins. Controlling the quality and
quantity of these membrane proteins is critical for these processes to work normally, and defects in the ability
to destroy misfolded proteins or getting rid of membrane proteins that are no longer needed cause a plethora
of human diseases. A central mechanism used to specify which proteins undergo degradation is attaching
ubiquitin to them. Ubiquitin is a small protein that is extremely well-conserved across the entire kingdom of
eukaryotic organisms. When ubiquitin is chemically linked to a membrane protein, it causes that protein to be
degradaded by cellular machinery that can recognize ubiquitin. Ubiquitin can also be linked to another
ubiquitin, forming polyubiquitin chains. Different polyubiquitin chains are made by changing how one ubiquitin
is linked to another, and different ubiquitin chains are used by different degradation machines. One machine
sorts membrane proteins to the interior of lysosomes by first sorting them into intralumenal vesicles that
accumulate within multivesicular endosomes/bodies (MVB). MVB sorting primarily uses ubiquitin chains that
are linked via lysine-63 of ubiquitin, which binds to a number of endosomal proteins that cluster and sort
ubiquitinated membrane proteins into intralumenal vesicles. These intralumenal vesicles can either be
delivered to the interior Lysosomes and be degraded, or they can be secreted as extracellular
vesicles/exosomes, that carry and delivery contents to other cells to elicit a range biological effects.
 Many critical questions remain outstanding about how proteins are sorted into endosomal intralumenal
vesicles and what differentiates how they are sorted to Lysosomes versus being sorted into exosomes. Aim1
will address these questions by examining the molecular mechanisms that two homologous sorting proteins
use to differentially sort proteins into intralumenal vesicles that go to Lysosomes or become exosomes.
 Additional questions remain about whether ubiquitin attachment to membrane proteins in the trans-
Golgi Network, Endosomes, and cell surface that have made it through their initial synthesis in the
endoplasmic reticulum (so-called ‘post-ER’ proteins) exclusively sends them through the MVB pathway as their
mode of degradation. We found that post-ER proteins modified with a different type of polyubiquitin chain are
sent along a different pathway for degradation. Aim2 will study the molecular features of this pathway and
assess how this pathway may contribute to controlling the quality and quantity of membrane proteins."
11034936,"Summary
A wide variety of subcellular complexes are composed of one or more intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
that are multivalent, flexible, and characterized by dynamic, reversible binding of diverse partner proteins. A
common but understudied type of multivalent IDP assembly exhibits a unique duplex topology, characterized by
parallel alignment of two IDP chains reversibly cross-linked by the ubiquitous LC8 hub protein, where the IDPs
allosterically enhance affinity for additional bivalent ligands. These duplexes can serve as a girder-like element
in large complexes, act as sensors, and facilitate or `template' the formation of large supra-molecular assemblies
(such as the dynein motor and nucleopore complex). Key features of these systems were identified in MPI
Barbar's lab, but studies of the structural and biochemical basis for this wide range of functionalities are
challenged by the diversity, internal mobility, and heterogeneity of the complexes formed.
This proposal will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of multivalent LC8
complex assemblies, by integrating an array of novel and existing methods of computational modeling - such as
weighted-ensemble molecular dynamics simulation - with experiments including isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and structural characterization such as nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), electron microscopy (EM), and native mass spectrometry (native MS). These techniques
were selected to address critical unanswered questions in the field: How much conformational and compositional
heterogeneity is intrinsic to these reversibly assembled duplexes, and how do they avoid a disordered state?
How does LC8 concentration, which is tightly controlled by the cell, modulate the heterogeneity? What do the
allosteric effects and associated mechanistic pathways indicate about regulation of the duplexes? What
differences are observed among duplex systems optimized for architectural vs. complex-scaffolding vs. sensing
roles? To address these questions, three largely independent aims will probe the ensemble thermodynamics
via ITC and theory dissecting species populations, the conformational ensemble via EM and theory from whole
complex- to atomistic-scale, and finally the atomistic basis of kinetic and cooperative behavior via simulations
and kinetics measurements.
The efforts will be guided by an experienced biophysics team with a wide-range of complementary expertise who
have been collaborating for several years - experts in theoretical biophysics (Zuckerman, MPI); in LC8 structural
biology, ITC and NMR (Barbar, MPI); in electron microscopy (Reichow, Co-I); and in native MS (Prell, Co-I). Our
track record of pioneering work on structure-function relations of LC8, success in both producing useful protein
constructs and handling these complex and partially disordered proteins, and the team's expertise in the battery
of computational, structural, biophysical, and biochemical techniques required to probe these systems, make us
uniquely suited to significantly advance the frontiers in the study of IDP multivalency."
11034039,"Aging and Parkinson's disease (PD). Aging is the primary risk factor for PD. Despite reported success
with neurotrophic or neuroprotective therapeutic drugs or cell replacement therapies in animal models of
PD, none have led to a clinically effective treatment avenue, curing all aspects of the disease complex.
Since aging is the number one risk factor for PD, it must be considered in designing appropriate animal
models. The studies proposed herein are unique in that we utilize aging as an important aspect of
our models, many studies have shown that the aged “environment” may be a critical factor in
response to therapeutics.
 Inflammation and Parkinson’s disease. Inflammation in the brain, in particular, activation of microglia
has been increasingly associated with the ongoing pathogenesis of PD, as well as several other
neurodegenerative disorders. An area that has not been widely considered is that innate immune function
is profoundly impacted by aging. We have demonstrated profound changes in proteomic profiles of
microglia with age, and others have examined genomic alterations as well. We have recently demonstrated
that some anti-inflammatory approaches to treat PD models that are successful in young animals, are not
as efficacious in aged animals. Pointing to an important role of aging as a factor involved in disease
progression and the response to therapeutics.
 Exosomes are powerful genomic modulators of inflammation: Human adipose-derived stem cells
(hASC’s) manifest a secretome that is capable of modulating the environment of the host. Among these secreted
molecules, small membrane-bound vesicles known as exosomes can modulate immune function as part of their
mechanism of action following both brain injury and epilepsy. Exosomes contain long non coding RNA (lncRNA)
that act as genomic modulators. Exosomes are an ideal vector for delivery of neuroprotective agents because
of their unique ability to hone to tissues, and their increased stability compared to un-encapsulated RNA. Further,
we have evidence that they modulate inflammation at the genomic level, making them a powerful tool to explore
as a therapeutic in PD
 Aging impacts microglial phenotype, reducing the efficacy some therapeutics. It is our hypothesis, that
hASC exosomes alter microglial function at a genomic level by delivery of lncRNA metastasis associated
lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), and other important factors, thus making them ideal for use in
aged subjects. We will explore this by isolating microglia from young and aged rats, treated with and without
intranasal hASC exosomes and perform advanced mass spectrometry based phenotypic profiling. We will
characterize microglia proteomic profiles during progression of an AAV9-a-synuclein model of PD in young
and aged rats.
 We hypothesize that hASDCexo will modulate the progression of PD pathology by interacting with the
innate immune system at the genomic level. Many therapeutic approaches focused on altering innate
immune function have been successful in reducing pathology from a-synuclein, including our studies with
CX3CL1. We hypothesize that hASCexo will reduce PD pathology by a modulating microglial gene
expression. We will examine this using intranasal delivery of hASCexo in an AAV9-Syn model of PD. We
further predict retained efficacy of exosomes in aged rats in modulating progression of PD pathology."
11034040,"Our long-term goals are to understand the mechanisms by which IL-1 receptor associated kinase-M (IRAK-
M) expression in melanoma regulates metastasis and to develop clinically-relevant approaches to induce and
sustain anti-tumor T cell immunity by restoring IRAK-M expression. Cancer metastasis is the main cause of
cancer mortality and morbidity, accounting for 90% of cancer-related deaths. Immunotherapy has
revolutionized the treatment of advanced (metastatic) melanoma and is now the standard of care for most
patients. Despite these successes however, clinical benefits are restricted to small percentage of patients. An
underlying and universal hindrance to immunotherapies is a variety of immunosuppressive mechanisms that
in large part originate from the chronic expression of inflammatory signals. Understanding the fundamental
mechanisms that regulate these factors and targeting these pathways is critical for developing effective
strategies to prevent or reduce metastases and to restore antitumor T cell activity. We previously reported that
the IL-1 receptor associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) is overexpressed and activated in melanoma. IRAK-4 is a
central kinase in the inflammatory process that also regulates the expression of metastases-promoting and
immunosuppressive molecules (including ATP, VEGF PDGF, IL-1). This signaling pathway is activated by IL-
1 receptor and toll-like receptors. We previously reported that inhibiting IRAK-4 activity in melanoma
drastically reduces the expression of many of these inflammatory factors and reduces cancer progression in
mice. By examining the levels of endogenous proteins that normally inhibit IRAK-4 signaling we found IRAK-M
to be deficient in melanomas (patients and cell lines). IRAK-M is unique among the IRAK family members in
that it is a negative regulator of inflammatory IRAK-4 signaling. We found that restoring IRAK-M expression in
melanoma cells drastically reduced their ability to invade (in vitro) and to metastasize (in preclinical models).
This was associated with changes in the expression levels of key molecules associated with cell mobility,
cytoskeletal dynamics, and formation of lamellipodium in non-cancerous cells but their role in melanoma or
metastasis is unknown. These molecules include Distal-Less Homeobox 5 (DLX5; a factor with transcription
activating and repressing activity), the integrin ITGA11, and cytoplasmic FMR1 Interacting Protein 2 (Cyfip2).
Furthermore, we observed that IRAK-4 signaling in melanoma accelerated T cell dysfunction while inhibiting
IRAK-4 enhanced antitumor T cell activity. IRAK-4’s ability to alter T cell activity was associated with its ability
to regulate extracellular ATP levels; ATP’s metabolite, adenosine, strongly suppresses T cell activity. Through
these studies, we will test the hypothesis that restoring IRAK-M expression in melanoma impairs their
metastatic potential by regulating the expression of DLX5 which in turn regulates cell invasion. We
further postulate that IRAK-M expression in cancer cells restores antitumor T cell activity by reducing the
expression levels of and signals originating from extracellular ATP. In Aim 1, we will determine the
mechanism by which IRAK-M regulates cancer cell invasion. This aim builds on compelling preliminary data
indicating that IRAK-M induction in cancer cells impairs their ability to invade through matrix or endothelial
cells (in vitro) and to metastasize (in vivo). We conjecture that DLX5 upregulates ITGA11 but downregulates
Cyfip2 expression thereby controlling cell migration, cell morphogenesis and invasion. Through Aim 2, we
propose to restore tumor immunity by reinstating IRAK-M signaling in tumor cells. We will use genetic
approaches and a predefined panel of drugs, that selectively induce IRAK-M in melanoma, to investigate the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IRAK-M enhances anti-tumor T cell activity. These studies have
the potential to provide mechanistic insights as to how IRAK-M regulate cancer cell metastasis and
opportunities to develop clinically relevant, novel strategies to restore tumor immunity."

Chronic pain is the primary cause of disability worldwide. According to the National Institutes of Health, nearly
25.3 million Americans suffer from daily pain, and another 23.4 million Americans report significant pain.
Approximately 1 in 5 adults worldwide suffer from pain, and another 1 in 10 adults are diagnosed with chronic
pain each year. We aim to develop dual inhibitors, single small molecules that will simultaneously inhibit two
enzymes: soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The most original and
mechanistically distinct aspect of these compounds is their ability to simultaneously inhibit two different enzymes
that play significant roles in pain and inflammation. Dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors described here have the potential
to be used as a promising novel non-opioid therapeutic strategy in pain management. In our previous NIH SC2
grant (GM135020), we identified several very potent dual inhibitors, and one was tested in a rat model of acute
inflammatory pain. Demonstrating antinociception of this dual inhibitor provided the first evidence that a dual
sEH/FAAH inhibitor alleviates acute inflammatory pain induced by intraplantar injection of dilute formalin. We
also observed that this dual inhibitor produces antinociception at lower doses than the traditional nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen. In the proposed studies, we will synthesize and evaluate novel libraries of
ligands that are designed to interact simultaneously with both target enzymes, assess and improve the drug-like
properties of these molecules, and evaluate whether two previously identified dual inhibitors together with the
new compounds (identified in this proposal) produce pain relief against chronic inflammatory pain in vivo in a rat
model of chronic inflammatory pain.
The compounds we propose to study represent a much-needed, completely novel non-opioid starting point in
pain management research. Because this class has different biological targets from existing analgesics, it
represents an opportunity to solve long-standing problems that have been linked to the existing opioid and non-
opioid therapies in pain management. To our knowledge, this proposal is the first attempt to use the strategy of
dual sEH/FAAH inhibitors as a rational therapeutic strategy for pain management. In addition, the design
principles and synthetic and in vivo tools behind these dual inhibitors are rigorous, comprehensive, and
innovative. This multipronged plan is a forte in our dual inhibition generation/optimization program. Our studies
may provide a foundation for the future investigation of the benefits of using the dual ligand strategy in analgesia.
This proposal represents a collaborative work between two Hispanic-serving institutions, California State
University, Fullerton and California State University, East Bay, with a strong collaborative partnership with the
University of California, Davis. Our multidisciplinary team has the expertise and resources to tackle this project
on the horizon to ensure continued success."

The cell cycle is an ordered series of molecular events in a cell leading to division and production of two
daughter cells. This process is fundamental to the development of all multicellular organisms, which begin from
a single cell, the fertilized egg. Equally important for proper development though, is the slowing or stopping of
the cell cycle at the right places and times as cells, tissues and organs mature. In fact, the majority of cells in
multicellular organisms spend most of their existence in non-proliferating states, often referred to as cellular
quiescence or the G0 phase. In their non-dividing state, quiescent cells are metabolically active and carry out
critical physiological functions in tissues and organs. Despite the importance of G0, most studies of cell cycle
regulation have focused on rapidly dividing cells. Thus, it remains unclear how cells choose to enter G0 during
development, and why some cells can choose to leave G0 and later re-enter the cell cycle in response to
developmental signals, tissue damage, or nutrient availability while others cannot. It has become clear that
there are multiple states of G0, some that are readily reversible, and others that are permanent. Different
states of states may be controlled in distinct ways, both in the manner of cell cycle inhibition and in the
pathways used to initiate exit. The goal of the work described here is to understand how the cell cycle
machinery is controlled during the decision to exit the cell cycle, and how G0 can be modulated to be
more or less reversible in different contexts. This work impacts a wide range of biological questions, as the
proper control of quiescence is critical in development and tissue regeneration, but becomes disrupted in aging
and cancer."
11013291,"Almost half the children in the U.S. are overweight and are likely to become obese adults, suffer from increased rates of type 2 diabetes, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and premature death. Unfortunately, there are very few non-invasive interventions available. Obesity has consequential effects in the brain and periphery, including on time-of-day dependent processes, which are present in nearly all cells and organ systems. A major gap in our knowledge is how early life overnutrition impacts neural circuits that regulate energy balance, particularly at the level of function cell physiology. Our project aims to investigate these effects using an integrated combination of neurophysiological approaches. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARH) is critical for the homeostatic control of food intake and metabolism, that also shows dynamic changes in gene expression over the day. ARH neuropeptide Y (NPY) ""hunger"" neurons are essential for metabolic function, but it is unknown how chronic postnatal overnutrition (CPO) impacts this critical population of cells. Aim 1 will investigate how CPO affects the physiology of ARH-NPY neurons. This will include brain slice electrophysiology to understand how time-of-day impacts the neurophysiology of these neurons and their synaptic inputs. The hormone leptin is essential for energy balance and CPO induces leptin resistance at the behavior level. In addition, diet-induced obesity alters diurnal fluctuations in endocrine signaling, including leptin. How CPO impacts the response of ARH-NPY neurons to leptin is unknown. We will employ electrophysiological approaches in Aim 2 to determine the mechanism(s) by which CPO alters leptin signaling in ARH-NPY neurons, with particular attention to time of day. There is robust foundational evidence supporting the investigation of both ARH-NPY neurons and leptin signaling to these neurons. Successful completion of these experiments will significantly contribute to our functional and mechanistic understanding of the impacts early life metabolic challenges have on the brain, and provide new avenues (including on the temporal domain) to confront long-term outcomes of childhood obesity."

Abstract: Intermediate filaments are highly conserved eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins present
in nearly every cell in the body. Although initially thought to simply provide structural support to
cells, intermediate filaments are now implicated in a variety of biological processes due
to their numerous protein interactions. Due to the number of intermediate filament monomers,
more than 70 in humans, and the complexity of their regulation, more than 100 posttranslational
modification sites, gaps remain in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which
they are regulated and by which they contribute to many biological processes. To begin to fill
these gaps, we seek to define molecular mechanisms by which intermediate filaments are
regulated in cells and to define how intermediate filaments contribute to inflammation by
focusing on their role in neutrophil inflammatory processes and migration. This proposal
builds on the PIs previous experience investigating intermediate filament function during
bacterial infection by proposing to leverage new cellular models of immortalized
neutrophil populations with established screening approaches successfully use by the PI to
define molecular mechanisms by which the intermediate filament vimentin contributes to
inflammatory processes. The flexibility in funding provided by this R35 program will enable the
PI the flexibility to follow the most promising lines of investigation and to leverage the
proposed approaches to train junior scientists within the laboratory. The successful
completion of the proposed studies is highly likely to improve our general
understanding about the biological processes in cells to which intermediate filaments contribute
and to our understanding of the mechanisms by which neutrophil function is regulated
during inflammation."

Chloride is the most abundant free anion in animal cells. Chloride channels play a wide range of functions
including cell volume regulation, fluid secretion, regulation of excitability, and acidification of intracellular
organelles. Their physiological role is impressively illustrated by many genetic diseases involving chloride
dysregulation, such as cystic fibrosis, myotonia, and epilepsy. However, despite recent progress, chloride
channels have long suffered as poor cousins in the aristocratic family of ion channels. For decades, the field has
been dominated by sodium, potassium and calcium channels. Indeed, there are still many electrophysiologically
well-characterized chloride channels without molecular identity. This gap makes it impossible to elucidate their
precise function and how their dysfunction leads to disease. In the previous R35 MIRA ESI funding period, we
performed an unbiased RNAi screen and identified PAC, a novel membrane protein with no sequence similarity
to other ion channels, as the long sought-after acid or proton-activated chloride (PAC) channel. By mediating
chloride influx and subsequent cell swelling, PAC currents have been implicated in acid-induced cell injury. We
generated PAC knockout mice and demonstrated that PAC plays a key role in acid-induced cell death in vitro
and ischemic brain injury in vivo. Thus, PAC is a potential drug target for stroke and other acidosis-associated
diseases. By combining mutagenesis, patch-clamp recording, and cryo-EM, we revealed for the first time the
trimeric assembly, ion conducting pathway, the basis of anion selectivity, pH-dependent conformational change,
and pH-sensing mechanism of this new channel. Discovery of a novel channel represents a breakthrough that
opens up a new field. In the next 5 years, we will focus on the diverse regulatory mechanisms of the PAC channel
and its surprising physiological function in vesicular acidification that we have recently discovered. The long-term
goal of this MIRA program is to apply a multi-disciplinary approach including high-throughput functional
genomics, patch-clamp electrophysiology, structural biology, imaging, and mouse genetics to the underexplored
area of chloride channel biology."
11033965,"The long-term goal of this project is to ameliorate neurotransmission defects due to mitochondrial dysfunction,
as a way to stop disease progression to later degenerative stages, increasing healthspan in populations
increasingly subject to age-related neurological diseases. Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) acts to promote
mitochondrial fission and has been identified as a therapeutic target for limiting aberrant mitochondrial
fragmentation in Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease. The goal of this project is to determine how DRP1
interaction with mitochondrial fission adapters impacts presynaptic terminal function. We propose that the need
for high levels of mitochondrial respiration to support synaptic transmission makes the presynaptic terminal a
high cellular stress environment. Regulated mitochondrial fission is important for cell survival in response to
cellular stressors, acting through DRP1, but the adapters utilized at the neuronal presynaptic terminal are
unknown. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine how loss of the mitochondrial fission adapter proteins MFF and
FIS1 affect mitochondria homeostasis and synaptic transmission. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine distinct
parameters of mitochondrial function and ultrastructure when DRP1 is eliminated, and attempt to rescue function
by targeting DRP1 re-expression to mitochondrial outer membrane. Phenotypic differences will be corelated with
those in Aim 1, to generate a complete picture of the effect of regulated mitochondrial fission on synaptic function.
DRP1 may also facilitate scission of plasma membrane at the synapse, but the impact of this additional function
on synaptic transmission is unresolved. In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that DRP1 facilitates
synaptic vesicle retrieval and recycling, and determine whether membrane-associated DRP1 is sufficient to
facilitate SV retrieval, and restore synaptic transmission. In collaboration, the PI and two other world-class
investigators have developed novel approaches to allow dissection of the isoform-specific role(s) of DRP1, using
the mouse calyx of Held as a model system. Using a combination of viral-mediated transgenesis, advanced
electrophysiology, and high-resolution light and electron microscopy, the ability of specific DRP1 isoforms to
support mitochondrial fission versus synaptic transmission and presynaptic SV retrieval will be systematically
tested. In contrast to small conventional synapses, experimental accessibility of giant ‘calyx-like’ excitatory
synapses allow recordings from the presynaptic terminal, permitting manipulation of presynaptic [ATP] and
tracking membrane exo/endocytosis in real time. This approach is necessary to dissect the energy-supporting
roles of synaptic mitochondria from mechanisms underlying synaptic vesicle recycling. Results from this project
can be used to inform, predict, and test function and dysfunction at conventional glutamatergic synapses where
disease-relevant neurodegeneration first appears. Knowledge generated from this project will identify viable
routes of intervention for restoring function to synapses where DRP1 function is altered, which can be leveraged
therapeutically to alleviate disease-related synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration."

False information can fuel distrust, hinder health literacy, and negatively impact public health responses, as
demonstrated during the pandemic. Yet health misinformation is epidemic, augmented by use of artificial
intelligence and social media. Misinformation increases health disparities and erodes trust in science,
especially in marginalized communities. To address this misinformation epidemic, we will use a strategy is to
leverage community-based networks to promote health, as trusted local influencers can disseminate accurate
health information that not only reaches its target audience but also is accepted by community members. Thus,
we hypothesize that trusted community influencers can promote scientifically sound, specifically tailored health
information in marginalized communities, and that involving students will make this effort sustainable.
Accordingly, Mount Sinai researchers partnered with the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health (AAIUH) to
create the Community Health Information and Education Forum (CHIEF), a collective of researchers,
community leaders, and students who use community-based participatory research to address health
disparities in Brooklyn in New York City. Through pilot funding, CHIEF has generated preliminary data and
assessed key needs in this target community. To respond to these needs, CHIEF will create a technology
platform to help community influencers spread scientifically sound information to Brooklyn residents, most of
whom are of African American and Afro-Caribbean descent. The technology platform will have two
components: a Message Mapping Dashboard, which will provide a cockpit for members of community-based
organizations to create, deploy, and measure health information campaigns; and a Mobile Health Bulletin
Board, a smartphone app especially designed for barbers and stylists, who are known influencers in
communities of color. The app will give these community influencers easy access to understandable, reliable,
and timely health infographics they can share with clients. Health messages for the dashboard and the mobile
app will be created by MPH and MD/MPH students taking graduate courses in health literacy and vetted by
faculty experts. Students participating in these programs will receive mentorship and training in health
communication and will have the opportunity to leverage CHIEF for research projects. Students also will
present at the Health Sciences Academy, an enrichment program for underrepresented minority high school
students, to expose these students to relevant issues as well as potential careers in public health research. By
applying principles of implementation science, CHIEF will be sustainable beyond the life of this grant by
creating an enduring technology platform that can be adapted by other marginalized communities. We expect
that this project will have measurable impact by focusing on trusted community resources to reach
disadvantaged populations, helping prevent spread of health misinformation in at-risk communities, promoting

Animals have evolved circadian (near-24 h) rhythms to anticipate and adjust their behavior to daily
opportunities and challenges such as mating, food availability, and predation. These behavioral rhythms are
synchronized to the solar day by the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). SCN
neurons exhibit daily rhythms in firing rate and clock gene expression that communicate circadian time to the
rest of the brain and body. However, critically, we do not know how SCN signals interact with molecular and
neuronal clocks in downstream neurons to generate circadian outputs. Our lab’s overarching goal is thus to
understand how circadian input from the SCN is encoded by target neurons to ultimately generate diverse
behavioral rhythms that peak at different times of day. To address this, over the next five years, our research
program will focus on several interrelated but independent themes, including defining the “transfer function” for
circadian output circuits, determining how molecular clocks in target neurons contribute to behavioral
rhythmicity, and understanding how target neurons integrate diverse inputs to generate behavioral rhythms.
We propose that endogenous rhythmicity in downstream neurons and daily input from SCN neurons are each
required to drive appropriately timed circadian behavioral outputs. Here, we will use multi-level analysis at the
molecular, circuit, and behavioral levels including targeted genomic editing of clock genes, in vivo and ex vivo
imaging of rhythmic neurons, and machine learning analysis of behavior to dissect circadian output circuitry in
two complementary species, the nocturnal laboratory mouse and the diurnal African striped mouse. Curiously,
molecular and neuronal activity rhythms in the SCN peak at similar times in diurnal and nocturnal animals. How
does an ostensibly identical SCN rhythm determine these dramatically different temporal niches? Our
approach will allow us to address this and other long-standing questions in chronobiology by identifying both
the mechanisms that temporally organize behaviors and the differences in molecular and neural function that
decide an animal’s temporal niche preference. Identifying the genes, neurons, and circuits that regulate the
timing of behavior in both laboratory mice and striped mice will also provide a novel framework for
understanding the biological basis of chronotype in humans and the etiology of circadian rhythm sleep
disorders. The discoveries we will make through our research program can generalize beyond circadian
biology to reveal fundamental mechanisms linking genes and circuits to behavior."

Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type in the human brain and are critical for central nervous system
(CNS) development and function. Mature astrocytes are unusually elaborate cells, with an intricate and
ramified morphology. Their numerous fine cellular processes interact closely with synapses, neuronal cell
bodies, axons, blood vessels, and other glial cells throughout the CNS. Through these interactions, astrocytes
fulfil diverse functions to support and enhance neuronal activity, maintain CNS homeostasis, and modulate
circuits. Underscoring the importance of proper astrocyte development, defects in astrocyte growth or loss of
astrocyte complexity are implicated in many neurological diseases, including Alexander's disease, autism, and
epilepsy. However, it remains poorly understood how astrocytes develop their intricate morphological
associations and regulate neural circuit function.
Our long-terms goals are to understand how astrocyte acquire their remarkable morphology, target their
processes to synapses, and use these cell-cell contacts to modulate brain function. We recently performed a
genetic screen in Drosophila to identify new regulators of astrocyte development, and uncovered a novel gene,
Trapped in endoderm 1 (Tre1), as required for astrocyte morphogenesis. We find that loss of Tre1 leads to
severely reduced astrocyte complexity in vivo, resulting in decreased infiltration of the synaptic neuropil. Tre1
encodes a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with no known function in the CNS. This proposal will use a
synergistic combination of molecular-genetic tools available in Drosophila and zebrafish along with new tools
we have generated and in vivo imaging to: determine how Tre1 regulates astrocyte morphogenesis, function,
and animal behavior in Drosophila (Aim 1); elucidate signaling pathways upstream and downstream of Tre1
activation (Aims 1+2); and define the evolutionary conservation of Tre1 in vertebrates (Aim 3). Our work will
provide exciting new insights into the mechanisms regulating astrocyte development and function in vivo and
lay the foundation for understanding astrocyte growth and dysfunction in human disease."

The evolutionarily-conserved Wnt signal transduction pathway directs cell proliferation and differentiation
during animal development and tissue homeostasis. Despite the fact that deregulation of Wnt signaling
underlies numerous developmental disorders and cancers, including nearly all colorectal cancers, many of
these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Thus, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that activate
this pathway will guide the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat Wnt-driven diseases. The
long-term goal of the PI’s research program is to elucidate the mechanisms that activate Wnt signaling during
animal development and to use this knowledge to identify control points in the pathway susceptible to
therapeutic targeting in Wnt-driven diseases. In support of this effort, the PI and her laboratory group have
established innovative in vivo models in Drosophila that have revealed unanticipated functions of three core
Wnt pathway effectors: the tumor suppressor, APC; the scaffold protein, Axin; and the ADP-ribose polymerase,
Tankyrase. Building on these findings and enabled by genome-wide screens designed to uncover new Wnt
signaling regulators, the current project will address three major unsolved questions: 1) how the membrane-
associated receptor activation complex is assembled and activated; 2) how the negative regulatory cytosolic
beta-catenin destruction complex is inhibited upon Wnt stimulation; and 3) how the nuclear beta-catenin-TCF
transcription complex is activated. To elucidate the role of previously unknown Wnt pathway activators, this
project will couple genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches with in vivo assays previously
developed by the PI to monitor pathway activation within Wnt signaling gradients. It will apply an innovative
focus centered on three components: a deubiquitinating complex essential for Wnt receptor stability, a ubiquitin
ligase essential for signaling activation, and a kinase that activates the beta-catenin-TCF transcription
complex. This work is complemented by productive collaborations with investigators who have expertise in the
biochemical reconstitution of Wnt signaling, Wnt pathway analysis in vertebrate models, and in the
identification of Wnt-dependent post-translational protein modifications using mass spectrometry analysis. The
successful completion of this work will provide an understanding of: 1) the control of Wnt receptor activity; 2)
the control of the beta-catenin destruction complex; 3) the activation of the Wnt transcription complex; and 4)
novel therapeutic strategies to target Wnt-driven diseases."

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) establish the rules of the genetic code, whereby each amino acid is
attached to a cognate tRNA. Errors in this process lead to mistranslation, which can be toxic to cells. Recent
studies suggest that the selective forces exerted by cell-specific requirements and environmental conditions
potentially shape quality control mechanisms. Approximately half of the ARSs possess a proofreading (or editing)
function to hydrolyze mischarged aa-tRNAs and evidence that non-proteinaceous amino acids pose the greatest
threat to fidelity is beginning to emerge. Early work in the Musier-Forsyth lab in the field of translational quality
control focused on our discovery of Class II prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS) editing. This led to a detailed
mechanistic understanding of the novel bacterial ProRS posttransfer editing domain (INS) and the demonstration
that the INS domain, when purified on its own outside the context of the ARS, was fully functional in tRNA
deacylation. We subsequently discovered that single-domain INS homologs are widespread in Bacteria and in
recent years, our focus in this area has turned almost entirely to understanding the function of these INS-like
domains in tRNA editing. However, many open questions regarding the physiological function of these putative
trans-editing proteins remain. The overarching goal of the research described in this MIRA application is to
uncover the specific functions of a growing family of trans-editing proteins known as the INS superfamily. This
diverse yet universally conserved family now has a solid and accumulating in vitro structure-function knowledge
base, which strongly supports a role in maintaining translational fidelity. Our knowledge of the broader
physiological roles of these proteins, especially in eukaryotes, is still in its infancy and is just beginning to reveal
wider roles than previously anticipated. This major gap will be addressed in this work. While classical knock-
down screens that only define essential versus non-essential genes do not immediately identify editing domains
as essential, the strong conservation of these domains implies they play important, and in most cases still
undiscovered, roles in cell survival and competitiveness. Proposed studies are designed to address some of the
many open questions with regard to both physiological trans-editing functions and potential moonlighting
functions of the INS superfamily. These domains are largely unexplored in eukaryotes, including a novel sub-
family cluster that is encoded in many unicellular eukaryotic pathogens. The therapeutic potential of trans-editing
domains has not been exploited and represents another major gap in the field that we hope to address by our
planned studies. In the long term, combining drugs that target novel translational fidelity mechanisms along with
known ribosome-targeting protein synthesis inhibitors such as aminoglycosides, may results in more effective
therapeutic strategies."

1. Summary of parent project
[From original submission of 1R35GM150562]
A central goal of regenerative medicine is to understand how cells functionally integrate into existing tissues to
restore homeostasis and behavior. Studies of regeneration following tissue damage in a group of ~6 species
have made considerable advances towards this goal by uncovering mechanisms that promote proliferation,
fate specification, and new cell survival. Pursuing these mechanisms, however, has revealed an underlying
problem: how tissue re-patterning is limited to provide functional restoration and the re-establishment of
homeostasis without detrimental overgrowth. To understand how growth and patterning are limited, and
conversely, how tissues regress controllably will require broadening the systems in which these phenomena
are examined to include models of natural, cyclical and highly stereotyped re-growth and degeneration. One
such system – seasonally breeding songbirds – offers an outstanding opportunity to test mechanistic hypoth-
eses of growth and degeneration and how events and outcomes at molecular and cellular levels impact higher-
level anatomy and behavior. This lab makes use of two different songbird species: Gambel’s white-crowned
sparrow (Zonotrichia leugophrys gambelli) and the domesticated canary (Serinus canaria domestica). White-
crowned sparrows are advantageous in having dramatic cycles of seasonal degeneration and regeneration of
the neural circuit that controls singing behavior; an extensive literature detailing their natural history; and high
tractability for experimental analyses due to their natural abundance and robustness in the lab. Canary breeds,
each having unique singing abilities and well-documented genetics, promise the ability to link historical
selection for particular allelic variants to regenerative form and function, and plasticity at the level of individuals
and populations. Exploiting the natural and dramatic degeneration–regeneration cycles in sparrows this
proposal aims to determine how cell death: (i) influences generation of new cells to limit total growth of neural
tissue and (ii) is finely tuned to prevent excessive degeneration of tissue and behavior while maintaining
competency for a return to homeostasis and subsequent plasticity. Exploiting the tight genetic control imposed
by breeders in selecting for exaggerated singing in canaries, the work aims to determine how diversification of
behavior arose from modifications to the balance between degeneration and regeneration, and how genetic
changes translate to cellular plasticity and emergence of novel behavior. Towards these goals, this program
will use a highly integrative and complementary set of approaches – including pharmacological manipulations
of intact neural circuits in freely behaving birds; classic cellular, molecular, and histological analyses; and state-
of-the-art genomic approaches – to interrogate the cellular, molecular, and evolutionary mechanisms regulating
tissue patterning and homeostasis. Uncovering proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying tissue
remodeling will add foundational knowledge to our understanding of hypertrophy and degenerative diseases
and may reveal new ways by which lost or damaged tissues can be replaced in a clinical context."

 PLP-dependent enzymes are one of the most versatile biocatalysts and catalyze a diverse range of
chemical transformations. They are widespread in nature and play critical roles in metabolism and numerous
cellular processes. Studying PLP enzymes is hence important for us to understand biology and develop
therapeutics. Because of their exquisite and versatile catalytic activity, PLP-dependent enzymes are also
remarkable biocatalysts to build diverse structurally complex and bioactive natural products; and are
indispensable biocatalytic tools for asymmetric synthesis of noncanonical amino acids and chiral amine
pharmaceuticals. However, despite the vast number of PLP-dependent enzymes characterized to date, our
abilities to predict, manipulate, and harness their activities are still largely limited. This research program desires
to fill the knowledge gap by integrating discovery, mechanistic investigation, and biocatalytic application to
systematically and comprehensively study four types of carbon-carbon (C-C) bond forming and cleaving PLP
enzymes, including our recently discovered PLP-dependent Mannich cyclase. These enzymes represent the
frontier of PLP enzymology because of their unusual activity, complementary synthetic utility to existing
biocatalysts, and unexpected evolutionary relationship with well-characterized PLP enzyme family. All proposed
aims are supported by strong preliminary data gathered in our laboratory. Our overarching goal is to understand
the chemical and substrate specificity and leverage this understanding to uncover previously unknown functions
of PLP-dependent enzymes and explore their non-native catalytic utility. Ultimately, the proposed research will
expand our mechanistic understanding on PLP enzymology, shed new light on metabolism, and provide novel
biocatalytic tools for amino acid biosynthesis."

Appalachian women are at high risk for lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death
for women in the US, including the Appalachian region. Although lung cancer rates have declined steadily among
men since the 1990s, such decreases have not been seen among women, including alarming mortality rates in
Central Appalachia. Interventions to reduce lung cancer risk among Appalachian women need to consider social
and environmental contexts. Research: This project, titled Reducing Lung Cancer Risk among Appalachian
Women Using Community-Engaged Intervention Research, relies on community perspectives to guide the
selection, adaptation, and pilot testing of a culturally-targeted intervention to reduce lung cancer risk among
Appalachian women. We will employ the NIH model for creating behavioral intervention trials to inform the
refinement of an intervention through direct community input (Phase 1a; Aim 1; K99) and to pilot test the selected
and adapted intervention protocol using a 2-armed randomized controlled trial (Phase 1b; Aim 2; R00). In the
pilot with Central Appalachian KY women, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the adapted intervention protocol,
including demand, acceptability, and implementation. The selected intervention will seek to increase knowledge,
self-efficacy, and targeted behaviors among Appalachian women thereby reducing their future lung cancer risk
and, ultimately, lung cancer disparities among women in the Appalachian region. Candidate: Dr. Jessica
Thompson is a postdoctoral scholar in an NCI-designated cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK) with
extensive previous training in community-engaged mixed methods research and chronic disease prevention
among Appalachian women. Three training goals will enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent
investigator, including developing expertise in: 1) the use of participatory systems science and community-
engaged approaches to select and adapt an intervention; 2) lung cancer prevention and risk reduction
interventions; and 3) intervention development and implementation science. Mentors/Environment: Dr.
Thompson’s career development plan includes substantial mentorship, didactic training, and experiential
learning at the UK Markey Cancer Center (MCC) with additional support from the UK Center for Health Equity
Transformation (CHET) and the UK Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). She will receive direct
mentorship from MCC Community Impact Office director Dr. Pamela Hull (Primary Mentor) and CHET director
Dr. Nancy Schoenberg (Co-Primary Mentor) with additional mentorship from Dr. Ellen Hahn (Mentor) in lung
cancer prevention and risk reduction, Dr. Teresa Waters (Mentor) in assessments of intervention effectiveness
and health economics, and Dr. Jessica Burke (Mentor; University of Pittsburgh) in systems science and
participatory methods. Overall, the objectives of this K99/R00 application will advance lung cancer intervention
research for Appalachian women by providing evidence for a future R01 submission and support Dr. Thompson’s
training as an independent scientist in implementing interventions to improve the health of Appalachian women."

We are requesting an instrument supplement to purchase an Incucyte S3 Live-Cell Analysis System from
Sartorius. Progress from the funded NIGMS R01 project for the past years has necessitated us implementing
the real-time and quantitative analysis of genome maintenance mechanisms in live cells. The Incucyte S3 allows
us to collect and analyze images of cell behaviors automatically and continuously in physiologically relevant
conditions. The specific applications relevant to the current project include, but are not limited to, real-time cell
cycle analysis, cellular proliferation, cell viability, and cell fate decision affected by the multiple mutants that we
have generated and under chemotherapy. The ability to monitor and image a variety of cellular processes
involved in DNA replication and stress responses under the real-time kinetics is crucial not only for the successful
completion of the parent R01 award but also for the new trajectories of research with a versatile and powerful
platform."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has had sweeping effects on pregnant women and their
partners. The need to adhere to social distancing guidelines has altered the social
connectedness of expectant parents, with effects on stress, loneliness, reduced access to in-
person prenatal care, and childbirth support. Social support during pregnancy is known to
buffer stress and predict better postpartum outcomes for both new parents and their infants.
For example, greater prenatal support has been linked with decreased risk of parental
postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, lower incidence of preterm birth and low birth
weight, calmer infant temperament, and healthier infant development. Given this evidence,
pandemic-induced changes to social connectedness during pregnancy may have long-term
effects for new parents and their children.
 The current proposal leverages the unique natural experiment of the COVID-19
pandemic to examine the maternal and infant health effects of social connectedness among
pregnant women and their partners. The CHIRP (Coronavirus, Health, Isolation and
Resilience in Pregnancy) study launched in spring 2020 and has enrolled 710 expectant
parents who reported on their feelings of social connectedness and support during
pregnancy. We will follow up with this cohort three, six, and 12 months after the birth of their
child. In addition to collecting self-report data, we will gather hospital birth charts to measure
gestational outcomes, and hair cortisol to measure neuroendocrine stress exposure. We also
plan to use geocoding to model the social, economic, and health impacts of the pandemic
and explore how these impacts shape postpartum outcomes. Our lab has already collected
data from another cohort of 200 expectant parents recruited during pregnancy and followed
over the transition to parenthood, constituting a pre-pandemic comparison sample with the
same measures and timing. We will also conduct a five-year follow-up with children from our
pre-pandemic dataset that will incorporate behavioral and neuroimaging measures of
neurodevelopment.
 Our pilot data indicates significantly higher ratings of psychological distress and lower
ratings of social support among expectant parents affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We
expect that this project will make important contributions to the study of stress and resilience
during pregnancy and its long-term effects on both maternal and infant well-being."

The future of Neuroscience must include representation of all people; such diversity is crucial to fuel the
innovation required to meet current scientific and healthcare challenges facing neuroscientists. In response to
RFA-NS-22-035, we propose a Doctoral Readiness training program – the Iowa Diversifying Research And
Mentorship (iDREAM) program. The iDREAM program leverages the power of (1) an outstanding
Neuroscience Graduate Program with long-running T32 support (JSPTPN), and (2) a strong institutional unit,
the Iowa Neuroscience Institute, which supports rigorous culturally aware faculty development and will provide
crucial administrative support for iDREAM. We have formed a compelling MPI leadership plan with a blend of
experience, skills sets, and energy. We will train four iDREAM post-bac scholars per year, for two years each,
drawn from a large pool of applicants from backgrounds underrepresented in Neuroscience and schools
without substantial research opportunities. Our Neuroscience Graduate Program is regularly composed of
>20% URM students and has a stellar track record of training future tenure-track faculty (>50%). iDREAM
scholars will be introduced to Neuroscience research via high-quality, hands-on research experiences in the
laboratories of carefully selected preceptors with manifest commitments to the iDREAM mission. Scholars will
receive rigorous training in the responsible conduct of research, evidence-based didactic training in the critical
thinking and communication skills necessary for a successful research career, and programmatic experiences
designed to cultivate an inclusive environment and sense of belonging within the local and global
Neuroscience communities. iDREAM scholars will partner with grad students in the Neuroscience Program for
near-peer mentorship experiences. Faculty research mentors are 28 well-funded neuroscientists with culturally
aware mentorship training and experience, who reflect the spectrum of gender, background, rank, and
neuroscience research topics and approaches. The mentors will be matched with trainees through a guided
interview process with careful oversight from the MPIs and Executive Committee. iDREAM scholars will attend
career development workshops, weekly scientific seminars and laboratory meetings, and present their
research at multiple local and one national meeting per year. iDREAM scholars will also be guided through all
aspects of the graduate school application process. Long term goals of the program include: 1) empowering
URM post-bac trainees to be competitive at rigorous, top-tier graduate programs in Neuroscience (including at
Iowa) and to lead successful scientific careers; 2) catalyzing progress of enhancing inclusive excellence within
the Neuroscience community at Iowa and beyond; and 3) reinforcing and strengthening existing partnerships
between the Neuroscience community at Iowa and schools without substantial research opportunities. Metrics
of success include the number of participants who apply for and are accepted in a rigorous neuroscience
graduate program, and students reporting a strong sense of belonging in the Neuroscience community."

This project supports the ABCD-ReproNim Educational Program, which provides research training in
responsible and reproducible analyses of data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study.
ABCD-ReproNim was established in 2020 as a NIDA-funded educational program and structured as a
collaborative partnership between ABCD investigators and ReproNim, a NIBIB-funded P41 center for
reproducible neuroimaging whose vision is to help researchers achieve more reproducible data analysis
workflows and outcomes. With over 1K registered students and >15K YouTube views, the previous version of
ABCD-ReproNim was well-received by the community and successfully achieved its goal to provide ABCD data
training while promoting skill development in reproducible analyses that support efficient, re-executable design
and FAIR practices. However, with advances in the field and increased data availability, we have identified gaps
in our previous curriculum. First, while one of our lecture modules focused on ABCD's cultural and
environmental variables, additional instruction is needed to train students on statistical and socioenvironmental
considerations for responsible data use. Second, one of the most significant developments in emerging,
population-based datasets, such as ABCD, is the availability of longitudinal data; however, many trainees lack
hands-on instruction for appropriately handling multiple time points in complex, large datasets. Third, our
previous students provided valuable feedback regarding challenges they experienced. We have addressed
many of their concerns by providing a more flexible course schedule, expanding support by adding a fellows
program, and increasing the quality and duration of hackathon preparation to prepare students to conduct their
own data analysis projects. Moving forward, we propose to refine and extend the innovative ABCD educational
approach. Participants will first receive didactic training across a 16-week online course that includes lectures,
readings, and data exercises; at the completion of the course, participants will contribute to team-based,
collaborative data analysis projects during a five-day hackathon at the host institution, Florida International
University, in Miami, Florida. Through this research educational program, we aim to provide: instruction
techniques that enhance the validity and reproducibility of research methods; a comprehensive understanding
of the ABCD dataset; implementation of an inclusive training model; support of interdisciplinary, team-based
collaborations; and dissemination of the course, project materials, and research findings. To achieve these
aims, we have assembled an interdisciplinary team of instructors and evaluators that includes ABCD Study
Investigators, ReproNim team members and collaborators, and non-ABCD/ReproNim researchers. Success will
result in the generation of a cadre of investigators that are well trained in the techniques that support
responsible, reproducible, and valid analyses of ABCD data."

Successful regeneration of tissues requires transient increases in stem cell plasticity, proliferation, and
differentiation, in order to produce new cells that integrate with preexisting tissues and organs. Pathways
governing these critical behaviors have been identified, but how injury signals can trigger stem cell proliferation
and differentiation of cells necessary for regeneration remains poorly understood. In most model organisms,
regenerative capacity is limited and stem cells are scarce, which has made it difficult to pinpoint the
mechanisms regulating stem cell proliferation and differentiation after injury. By contrast, the planarian
flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea has abundant stem cells that are activated by injury and fuel continuous
regeneration. Like embryonic stem cells, planarian stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into any type of
tissue. These pluripotent stem cells can be readily identified, monitored, purified, and thoroughly profiled at the
molecular level. We recently made two important discoveries that form the foundation of this proposal. First,
injury of any type appears to protect stem cells from lethal radiation, because it halts the cell cycle and fewer
stem cells undergo apoptosis. Second, we pioneered a chemical method to selectively remove a single organ,
the pharynx. Pharynx regeneration requires the upregulation of the conserved Forkhead transcription factor
FoxA in a discrete subset of stem cells immediately after this targeted injury. We find that the mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a central driver of these behaviors. MAPK promotes stem cell
differentiation in cultured stem cells, but its roles in physiologically-relevant contexts are poorly understood.
Together, these findings establish our central hypothesis, which is that injury synchronizes the cell cycle,
enabling local cues to channel stem cell differentiation toward discrete cell fates. In Aim 1, we will determine
how injury induces cell cycle arrest in stem cells after radiation. We will examine DNA repair and test the
function of conserved genes that are upregulated after injury. In Aim 2, we will dissect the mechanisms driving
organ-specific regeneration by purification and single-cell sequencing of stem cells proliferating after organ
loss, and then testing their function in organ regeneration. In Aim 3, we will identify the upstream receptors that
activate MAP kinase signaling in stem cells with combinations of RNAi, pharmacology and biochemistry. This
proposal exploits our ability to challenge stem cells with precise insults, providing a lens into the mechanisms
that enable flexible stem cell responses during injury and homeostasis. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms that govern stem cell behavior in a physiologically-relevant context will inform the design of future
strategies for regenerative medicine technologies."

Transcription is the major control point of gene expression and RNA polymerase (RNAP), conserved
from bacteria to man, is the central enzyme of transcription. Our long term goal is to understand the
mechanism of transcription and its regulation. Determining three-dimensional structures of RNAP and
its complexes with DNA, RNA, and regulatory factors, is an essential step. We focus on highly
characterized prokaryotic RNAPs.
The basic elements of the transcription cycle, initiation, elongation, and termination, were elucidated
through study of prokaryotes. A detailed structural and functional understanding of the entire
transcription cycle is essential to explain the fundamental control of gene expression and to target
RNAP with small-molecule antibiotics. Moreover, a complete understanding of how a complex,
molecular machine uses binding and chemical energy to effect conformational changes that drive the
cycle, and how regulators modulate the cycle, is of fundamental interest.
The transcription cycle is marked by a series of stable complexes (core è holo è RPo è EC) that
interconvert through transient intermediates. The transitions between stable states are points of
heavy regulation that are poorly understood due to the lack of structural information. Major transitions
include:
Holoenzyme + promoter DNA è open promoter complex (initiation)
Open promoter complex è elongation complex (promoter escape, s dissociation)
Elongation complex è core RNAP + DNA + completed RNA transcript (termination)
Each of these transitions is characterized by unstable, transient intermediates that are extremely
challenging for structural biology. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has emerged as a powerful
method to visualize these transient states. We are combining cryo-EM with other approaches to
mechanistically and structurally characterize transient intermediates that govern transitions in the
bacterial transcription cycle, including promoter melting, the initiation to elongation transition, and
transcription termination. These findings will provide insight into the behavior of macromolecular
machines throughout biology."
